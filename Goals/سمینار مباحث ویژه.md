## an overview of PNIPAM
applications, it's forms, properties 

## monomers
what are they
their characteristics
what functional groups they have
what are the effects of each functional group on its properties

## polymerisation
What are the main ways
how do they polymerise

## the polymer
main properties (physical and mechanical)
about one or two unique property
in monomer scale, what is causing the polymer to act like that


## conclusion 
wrap up
