## تاریخچه

  

Ancient civilizations, including those in **Egypt, India, and China**, used sunlight to treat various skin diseases such as **psoriasis, vitiligo, and skin cancer**. The Ancient Egyptians used plants like **Ammi majus, parsnip, parsley, and Saint-John’s-wort** to create a powder that was applied to depigmented lesions. When exposed to sunlight, it resulted in skin pigmentation similar to sunburn. In one of India's sacred books, Atharava-Veda (1400 BC), people suffering from **vitiligo** were given plant extracts from the **Bavachee plant (Psoralea corylifolai)** and instructed to stand in the sunlight. Phototherapy was introduced in China during the Han dynasty in the first century BC. Four centuries later, during the Tang dynasty, people would expose green paper with red dye to sunlight, soak it in water, and drink it to benefit from the sun's healing properties. The use of **psoralen-containing topicals** and sunlight exposure dates back thousands of years. This therapy, documented in ancient books such as the Atharavaveda and the Papyrus Ebers, was used to treat vitiligo and psoriasis in India, Egypt, and Greece. Today, this therapy is known as **PUVA-therapy**, which differs from PDT in its mechanisms but involves drug activation by light.

## کاربرد های درمان فتودینامیک

  

 superficial = limited to the mucosa or submucosa.

  

Superficial Cancers and Precancerous Lesions: PDT is highly effective in treating superficial cancers and precancerous lesions due to the limited penetration of light. 

  

Non-Oncological Applications:

●

Dermatology: PDT is used to treat various dermatological conditions, including:

Ophthalmology: PDT is used in ophthalmology for:

○

Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): PDT with verteporfin is a treatment option for AMD, although its use has been somewhat limited by the emergence of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors2526.

○

Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV): PDT has shown promising results in treating PCV, with various studies exploring its efficacy27.

●

Dentistry: PDT is used in dentistry for:

○

Periodontitis: PDT is effective in killing plaque pathogens and treating periodontitis28.

○

Endodontic Disinfection: PDT can sterilise endodontic root canals28.

●

Infectious Diseases: PDT has a broad spectrum of action against microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. It is being explored for treating various infections, particularly those resistant to conventional antibiotics

  

  

Emerging Applications:

●

Photochemical Internalization (PCI): This technique combines PDT with chemotherapy or immunotherapy to enhance drug delivery and efficacy333435.

●

Immunotherapy: PDT's ability to stimulate the immune system is being investigated in combination with other immunotherapies for improved cancer treatment

  

  

its application for non-superficial cancers is more complex and presents several challenges.

**Challenges and Limitations:**

- **Light Penetration:** One of the main limitations of PDT for non-superficial cancers is the limited penetration depth of the light used to activate the photosensitizers. Most clinically approved photosensitizers are activated by light in the UV/VIS range, which does not penetrate deeply into tissues, making it difficult to treat deep-seated tumors effectively 4 5 6.
- **Tumor Accessibility:** PDT is more effective for tumors that are accessible to light sources. For deep or large tumors, the light may not reach all cancer cells, reducing the treatment's efficacy 4 6.

**Advancements and Potential Solutions:**

- **Nanotechnology:** Recent advancements in nanotechnology have shown promise in enhancing PDT's efficacy for deeper tumors. Nanoparticles can be used to deliver photosensitizers more effectively and improve light penetration. For example, near-infrared (NIR) light-excited nanomaterials and X-ray excited scintillating nanoparticles are being explored to extend the activation wavelength and improve treatment depth 5 7 8.
- **Combination Therapies:** Combining PDT with other treatment modalities, such as immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or photothermal therapy, can enhance its effectiveness against non-superficial cancers. These combination strategies can help overcome some of the limitations of PDT alone 8 9 10.

  

Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an emerging clinically approved modality, has been used for treatment of various cancer diseases. Conventional PDT strategies are mainly focused on superficial lesions because the wavelength of illumination light of most clinically approved photosensitizers (PSs) is located in the UV/VIS range that possesses limited tissue penetration ability, leading to ineffective therapeutic response for deep-seated tumors. The combination of PDT and nanotechnology is becoming a promising approach to fight against deep tumors. Here, the rapid development of new PDT modalities based on various smartly designed nanocomposites integrating with conventionally used PSs for deep tumor treatments is introduced. Until now many types of multifunctional nanoparticles have been studied, and according to the source of excitation energy they can be classified into three major groups: near infrared (NIR) light excited nanomaterials, X-ray excited scintillating/afterglow nanoparticles, and internal light emission excited nanocarriers. The in vitro and in vivo applications of these newly developed PDT modalities are further summarized here, which highlights their potential use as promising nano-agents for deep tumor therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for deep tumor treatment is largely limited by light penetration depth in tissue. To address this issue, various strategies based on nanomaterials including near infrared excited PDT, X-ray excited PDT and internal light emission excited PDT have been proposed.

## عاملان حساس به نور

Photosensitising agents, also known as photosensitizers (PSs), are central to photodynamic therapy (PDT)12. They are typically dye-like substances that remain therapeutically inactive until exposed to light of a specific wavelength1. When a photosensitizer absorbs light energy, it becomes excited and triggers a photochemical reaction

  

key characteristics of photosensitizing agents:

●

Light Absorption: Photosensitizers absorb light at specific wavelengths. Longer wavelengths, such as red light, are preferred because they penetrate deeper into tissues and cause less direct damage14.

●

Free Radical Generation: Upon light activation, photosensitizers interact with oxygen to generate highly reactive free radicals (ROS), primarily singlet oxygen, which are responsible for the localized destruction of tumour tissue13.

●

Chemical Structure: Photosensitizers commonly have conjugate structures and are often derived from porphyrins, chlorins, and cyanins4. Examples of clinically approved photosensitizers include Photofrin (Porfimer Sodium), Foscan (mTHPC), Visudyne (BPD-MA), Levulan (ALA), and Metvix (MLA)4. ALA and MLA are precursors to porphyrins and are converted into active photosensitizers within the body4.

●

Toxicity Considerations: Photosensitizers can cause photosensitivity, making patients susceptible to sunburn-like reactions and potential retinal damage upon exposure to sunlight3. Therefore, toxicological evaluations of photosensitizers include assessing their photosensitivity and determining the duration of required precautions against light exposure

PDT can affect several biological processes involved in cancer development and progression:

**Hypoxia and Angiogenesis**

- **Hypoxia** in the tumour microenvironment can hinder PDT effectiveness as oxygen is crucial for generating ROS. Deeper tumours often experience oxygen depletion, which can reduce ROS production and limit treatment efficacy. Strategies to address hypoxia include increasing oxygen availability in the tumour using oxygen carriers like perfluorocarbons and haemoglobin, utilising Type I photochemical reactions that are less reliant on oxygen, and combining PDT with other oxygen-independent or hypoxia-activated therapies.
- PDT can indirectly affect **angiogenesis** by damaging tumour vasculature and inducing hypoxia, potentially reducing pro-angiogenic factor levels like VEGF. High doses of certain photosensitisers can damage microvasculature, further reducing oxygen supply. PDT can also induce vascular shutdown and thrombosis, limiting blood flow and potentially worsening hypoxia.

**Extracellular Matrix (ECM)**

- PDT-induced ROS could potentially influence the ECM, although this is not explicitly addressed in the sources. ROS can activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that degrade ECM components, altering the tumour microenvironment and potentially affecting tumour cell behaviour and invasiveness.

**Apoptosis**

- PDT is known to induce **apoptosis**, a key mechanism of tumour cell death. PDT-generated ROS can trigger both the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) and extrinsic (extracellular receptor-activated) apoptotic pathways. Mitochondria are frequently identified as targets for PDT-induced damage, leading to the release of apoptogenic factors.

**Other Biological Mechanisms of PDT**

- **Cell Cycle Arrest:** PDT can induce cell cycle arrest in cancer cells, inhibiting tumour growth by preventing cells from progressing through the cell cycle and dividing.
- **DNA Damage:** ROS generated by PDT can directly damage DNA, leading to strand breaks and base modifications. This damage can trigger cell death pathways, impair DNA replication and repair, and hinder tumour cell proliferation.
- **Autophagy:** Autophagy, a cellular process involving the degradation and recycling of cellular components, can be triggered by PDT-induced oxidative stress. Autophagy can either promote cell survival or contribute to cell death depending on the extent of activation.
- **Immune Cell Infiltration:** PDT can increase the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour microenvironment due to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying tumour cells and the upregulation of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells.
- **Cytokine Modulation:** PDT can modulate cytokine production, potentially enhancing anti-tumour immunity by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α.
- **Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD):** PDT can potentially induce ICD, a form of cell death that elicits a potent immune response against the tumour. ICD is characterized by the release of specific DAMPs, which stimulate dendritic cell maturation and activation, leading to a more effective anti-tumour immune response.

These biological mechanisms are interconnected and can influence each other. The specific mechanisms and their contributions to the anti-tumour effect of PDT can vary depending on factors like the photosensitiser, light dose, tumour type, and microenvironment.

## انواع ROS

  

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce cell death and tissue destruction. The specific ROS involved in PDT include:

- **Singlet Oxygen (¹O₂):** This is the **primary and most important ROS** generated in PDT, particularly through the Type II photochemical reaction. It's a highly reactive form of oxygen that causes oxidative damage to various cellular components, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Singlet oxygen is considered crucial for the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. Its short intracellular half-life (10–320 nanoseconds) limits its diffusion, making it highly localised in the area where the photosensitizer is activated.
- **Superoxide Radical (O₂⁻•):** This ROS is produced mainly through the Type I photochemical reaction, where the excited photosensitizer directly interacts with substrate molecules. Superoxide radicals can further react to form other ROS, contributing to the overall oxidative stress.
- **Hydroxyl Radical (HO•):** This is a highly reactive ROS formed through reactions involving superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. It can cause significant damage to cellular components.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂):** Although less reactive than singlet oxygen or hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide can contribute to oxidative stress and can be converted into more reactive ROS, particularly in the presence of metal ions.

The relative contribution of each ROS to PDT-induced damage depends on factors like the type of photosensitizer used, the substrate molecules present, oxygen concentration, and the microenvironment of the targeted tissue. While **singlet oxygen remains the dominant ROS responsible for PDT's therapeutic effects**, the other ROS also contribute to the overall cell death and tissue damage.

##  مکانیزم تولید singlet oxygen

  

The formation of singlet oxygen in photodynamic therapy (PDT) primarily occurs through the **Type II reaction**, a photochemical process involving energy transfer from an excited photosensitiser molecule to molecular oxygen. Here's a more detailed explanation based on the sources and our previous conversation:

### Photosensitiser Activation and Energy Transfer:

1. **Ground State Photosensitiser:** The process begins with a photosensitiser molecule in its stable **ground singlet state (S0)**
2. **Light Absorption and Excitation:** When exposed to light of a specific wavelength matching its absorption spectrum, the photosensitiser absorbs energy from photons. This absorption excites the photosensitiser from its ground state (S0) to a short-lived, electronically excited singlet state (S1).
3. **Intersystem Crossing:** The excited singlet state (S1) is unstable. It can decay back to the ground state through:

- **Fluorescence**: The emission of light.
- **Internal Conversion**: The conversion of energy into heat. However, the excited singlet state can also undergo **intersystem crossing (ISC)**. This is a non-radiative transition where the spin of the excited electron reverses, leading to the formation of a more stable, longer-lived, electronically excited **triplet state (T1)**.

1. **Energy Transfer to Molecular Oxygen:** The longer lifetime of the triplet state (T1) is crucial for the Type II reaction. This extended lifespan allows sufficient time for the excited photosensitiser to encounter and interact with molecular oxygen (3O2), which exists in its triplet ground state. The excited photosensitiser then transfers its energy to molecular oxygen, exciting it to a higher energy level, the **singlet state (1O2)**.

### The Significance of Singlet Oxygen:

- Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a highly reactive form of oxygen and the primary cytotoxic agent responsible for the therapeutic effects of PDT.
- The Type II reaction is the dominant mechanism for singlet oxygen generation in PDT.
- Singlet oxygen's high reactivity stems from its electronic configuration. In its ground state (3O2), molecular oxygen has two unpaired electrons with parallel spins. In the singlet state (1O2), these electrons are paired, making it eager to react with other molecules.

### Factors Affecting Singlet Oxygen Production:

Several factors influence the efficiency of singlet oxygen production during PDT:

- **Photosensitiser Properties**: The photosensitiser's molecular structure and photophysical properties, such as its **quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation**, significantly impact the amount of singlet oxygen produced. This quantum yield is determined by the efficiency of intersystem crossing to the triplet state and the triplet state's lifetime.
- **Oxygen Concentration**: The presence of oxygen is essential for the Type II reaction. Hypoxic conditions within the tumour microenvironment can limit singlet oxygen production and reduce PDT effectiveness. Strategies to overcome this limitation include increasing oxygen availability through exogenous oxygen carriers or promoting endogenous oxygen generation.
- **Light Dose and Fluence Rate**: The light dose and fluence rate used during PDT also affect singlet oxygen production. Higher light doses generally lead to more singlet oxygen generation, but excessive doses can deplete oxygen and reduce treatment efficacy.

## شیوه های انتقال عامل به بدن

  

The need for a carrier to transfer a photosensitiser (PS) into the body depends on the specific PS used and the target tissue. Some PSs, like 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), can be applied topically in cream form for superficial skin lesions1. However, for systemic PDT, or when deeper penetration is required, a carrier is often necessary.

Here are some ways PSs are delivered into the body:

Direct Administration:

●

Topical Application: This involves applying a cream or solution containing the PS directly to the target area on the skin

Carrier-Mediated Delivery:

Carriers are often used to improve the delivery of PSs, enhance their solubility, protect them from degradation, and target them to specific tissues. Some common carrier systems include:

Liposomes

Nanoparticles

Polymer Micelles

## ماف ها

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of materials for use as carriers of photosensitisers (PSs) in photodynamic therapy (PDT). MOFs are highly porous, crystalline materials formed by strong bonds between metal ions/clusters and organic linkers. **Their unique properties, such as high porosity, large surface area, tunable pore size, and biodegradability, make them ideal candidates for PS delivery and enhance PDT efficacy**.

Here are some of the key advantages of using MOFs as PS carriers:

- **Enhanced PS Loading:** The high porosity and large surface area of MOFs allow for the incorporation of a significant amount of PSs within their structure. This can lead to increased PS concentrations at the target site, potentially improving PDT effectiveness.
- **Improved PS Solubility and Stability:** MOFs can encapsulate hydrophobic PSs within their pores, enhancing their solubility and protecting them from degradation. This can improve PS bioavailability and extend their circulation time.
- **Targeted Delivery:** MOFs can be functionalized with targeting moieties, such as antibodies or peptides, that specifically bind to receptors on tumor cells. This targeted delivery approach can enhance PS accumulation at the tumor site while minimizing off-target effects.
- **Controlled Release:** The release of PSs from MOFs can be controlled by tuning their pore size, composition, and degradation rate. This allows for the delivery of PSs to the target tissue at a desired rate, potentially improving treatment outcomes.
- **Synergistic Therapeutic Effects:** MOFs can be loaded with other therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapeutic drugs or imaging agents, in addition to PSs. This multimodal approach can enhance PDT efficacy by combining different treatment modalities.

Sources highlight the use of MOFs as carriers to overcome some limitations of organic PSs. The limitations and how MOFs address them are:

- **Hypoxia:** MOFs can store oxygen or generate oxygen photocatalytically. They can also mimic the activity of catalase, an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
- **Low Efficiency of Cancer Cell Killing:** MOFs can enhance cancer cell killing efficiency by combining PDT with other therapies like chemodynamic therapy. They can also have a higher singlet oxygen generation ratio and generate various reactive oxygen species.
- **Low Penetration of Light in Tissue:** MOFs can be incorporated with up-conversion elements to address the issue of light penetration.
- **Photobleaching:** MOFs can offer higher photostability to minimize photobleaching.
- **Rapid Clearance from Blood Circulation:** Applying a polymer or cell membrane coating to the MOF can slow down rapid clearance.

Several types of MOFs have been investigated for PDT applications, including UiO (University of Oslo), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), and porphyrin-based MOFs. These MOFs have shown promising results in preclinical studies, demonstrating efficient PS delivery, enhanced PDT efficacy, and reduced side effects.

While MOFs hold great potential as carriers for PSs in PDT, **challenges remain regarding their biostability and toxicity in a biological environment**. The degradation rate of MOFs in biological media and their potential toxicity depend on factors such as the metal-ligand bond strength, ligand basicity, and the characteristics of the metal and organic components. Functionalizing and coating MOFs with hydrophobic polymers have shown promise in enhancing their stability, but the potential impact of hydrophobicity on cytotoxicity needs further investigation.

In conclusion, **MOFs are emerging as promising nanocarriers for PSs in PDT**. Their unique properties enable efficient PS delivery, improved tumor targeting, and synergistic therapeutic effects. Addressing the challenges related to biostability and toxicity will pave the way for the clinical translation of MOF-based PDT, offering a novel approach to cancer treatment with improved efficacy and reduced side effects.

## چالش انتخاب ماف مناسب برای کاربرد

  

It can be **challenging to choose an appropriate MOF for a specific application solely through experiments** due to the inherent complexities and limitations of experimental procedures.

- **Experimental examination of MOFs is often complex, costly, and time-consuming.** This makes it impractical to experimentally test every potential MOF for a given application.
- **The synthesis and characterization of MOFs can be labour-intensive and may not always yield the desired results.** This is further complicated by the fact that the properties of synthesized MOFs can vary depending on experimental conditions, making it challenging to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
- **The vast number of MOFs, both real and hypothetical, makes experimental screening a daunting task.** The number of experimentally synthesized MOFs is rapidly growing, surpassing 100,000 entries in the Cambridge Structural Database. Furthermore, computational methods have enabled the creation of massive databases of hypothetical MOFs, expanding the potential material space to near infinity. Experimentally testing even a small fraction of these possibilities is infeasible.
- **Specific applications may require a unique combination of properties that are difficult to predict based solely on intuition or simple heuristics.** For instance, a MOF intended for drug delivery might need to exhibit specific characteristics such as nano-size, high surface area, MRI capabilities, and small pore diameters. Identifying a MOF that meets all these criteria through trial-and-error experimentation would be highly inefficient.
- **Unforeseen challenges may arise during experimental testing that necessitate further optimization and modification.** For example, a MOF initially deemed suitable for drug delivery may exhibit low encapsulation efficiency or unexpected toxicity, requiring additional design and synthesis efforts. This iterative process can significantly prolong the development timeline.

In conclusion, while experiments are essential for validating the performance of selected MOFs, **relying solely on experimental approaches to choose the most appropriate MOF for a specific application is inefficient and impractical.** Computational methods, including machine learning, offer a valuable alternative for navigating the vast MOF material space and guiding the selection of promising candidates for experimental validation.

  

## نقش شبیه سازی

  

MOFs possess an almost infinite material space due to their exceptional **chemical versatility** and **modularity**. This vastness arises from the countless combinations of metal ions/clusters and organic linkers that can be used to construct MOFs, leading to diverse structures and properties. Researchers can further tailor MOFs by modifying the linkers, exchanging metals/linkers, introducing guests, engineering defects, and creating composites with other materials like polymers, zeolites, and graphene oxides.

The ability to computationally construct and evaluate **hypothetical MOFs (hMOFs)** contributes significantly to the concept of an infinite material space. This is possible due to the relatively simple synthesis motifs of MOFs, allowing for the assembly of building blocks _in silico_ while retaining their characteristic coordinate covalent chemistry.

Simulations play a critical role in exploring this expansive MOF material space by enabling researchers to go beyond experimentally synthesized structures and delve into the realm of hypothetical frameworks. Here's how simulations contribute:

- **Hypothetical MOF Construction:** Computational methods, such as those devised by Wilmer et al., allow for the creation of vast libraries of hMOFs. These methods assemble MOF building blocks in silico, generating new structures that haven't been physically synthesized yet.
- **Performance Evaluation of hMOFs:** Simulations, such as DFT and GCMC, can predict the properties of hMOFs, allowing researchers to evaluate their potential for various applications without actual synthesis. This includes assessing gas storage and separation capabilities, catalytic activity, and mechanical stability.
- **Efficient Screening of Vast Libraries:** High-throughput computational screening techniques, facilitated by advanced hardware and software, enable the rapid evaluation of thousands of hMOFs. This accelerates the identification of promising candidates from the virtually limitless pool of possible structures.

The integration of computational methods, particularly simulations, with experimental efforts has transformed MOF research. By exploring the vast space of hMOFs, simulations have accelerated the discovery of MOFs with tailored properties for specific applications. This synergistic approach continues to unlock the potential of MOFs, driving the development of innovative materials for a wide range of fields.

  

Simulations are essential tools for exploring the vast MOF material space and predicting their properties for specific applications. However, despite their usefulness, simulation methods face various limitations that hinder their effectiveness in choosing the optimal MOF for a given application. Here are some key limitations:

### **Computational Cost and Time Constraints:**

- High-level quantum chemical simulations, such as DFT calculations, are computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for complex MOF structures with large unit cells. These methods require significant computational resources, limiting the scale of studies and the number of MOFs that can be realistically evaluated.
- While classical simulations like MD and GCMC are faster than DFT, they can still be computationally demanding, especially when considering large-scale screening of thousands of MOFs for various applications.
- The computational cost and time constraints associated with simulations hinder the efficient exploration of the vast MOF material space and restrict the ability to screen a wide range of potential MOF structures for a specific application.

### **Reliance on Accurate Force Fields:**

- Classical simulations heavily depend on accurate force fields to describe the interactions between atoms within the MOF and between the MOF and guest molecules.
- Developing and validating accurate force fields for diverse MOF compositions, functional groups, and guest molecules is a complex and challenging task.
- Inaccuracies in force fields can lead to significant errors in predicted MOF properties, making it difficult to reliably assess their suitability for a specific application.
- The over-reliance on force field parameters in classical MD simulations, without proper validation, can lead to misleading predictions of MOF behaviour and performance.

### **Difficulty in Predicting Synthesizability:**

- A major limitation of simulations is their inability to reliably predict whether a computationally designed MOF can be successfully synthesized experimentally.
- Many hypothetical MOFs, despite showing desirable properties in simulations, might not be synthesizable due to limitations in current experimental techniques or the inherent instability of certain MOF structures.
- This disconnect between computational design and experimental synthesis can lead to wasted time and resources in pursuing MOFs that are practically unattainable.

### **Limited Consideration of Experimental Conditions:**

- Simulations often operate under idealised conditions that might not accurately reflect the real-world environment in which a MOF would be used.
- Factors such as temperature, pressure, solvent effects, and the presence of impurities are not always fully accounted for in simulations.
- This discrepancy between simulated and experimental conditions can lead to deviations in the actual performance of a MOF compared to its predicted behaviour.

### **Lack of Comprehensive Data for Specific Applications:**

- For certain applications, such as drug delivery, the available data for training and validating simulation models might be limited.
- This lack of data can hinder the accuracy and reliability of simulations in predicting MOF performance for specific applications, particularly in emerging fields where experimental data is still accumulating.

In conclusion, simulation methods are powerful tools for MOF research, but their limitations in computational cost, force field accuracy, prediction of synthesizability, and consideration of real-world conditions can pose challenges in choosing the right MOF for a specific application. Machine Learning offers promising solutions to address these limitations by accelerating screening, improving accuracy, predicting synthesizability, and enabling data-driven exploration of the MOF material space, as emphasized throughout the sources.

Choosing the right Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) for a specific application can be challenging due to the vast number of potential MOF structures and the complexity of predicting their performance. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting the scope of exploration. Additionally, there's the risk of identifying computationally promising MOFs that are difficult or impossible to synthesize experimentally.

Here are some key problems in choosing an appropriate MOF for a specific application that can be addressed using Machine Learning (ML) methods:

- **Accelerated Screening of Large MOF Libraries:** ML can significantly speed up the process of screening vast libraries of both real and hypothetical MOFs. Instead of performing computationally demanding simulations on every structure, ML algorithms can learn from a smaller dataset of calculated or experimentally obtained data and then predict properties for a much larger number of MOFs. This enables researchers to quickly identify top-performing candidates for a target application without exhaustive and time-consuming simulations.
- **Improved Property Prediction Accuracy:** ML models can achieve high accuracy in predicting MOF properties relevant to various applications. By training on comprehensive datasets and incorporating diverse descriptors, ML models can accurately predict properties like gas storage capacity, separation performance, mechanical properties, and water stability. This accuracy is essential for making informed decisions about the suitability of a particular MOF for a desired application.
- **Prediction of Synthesizability:** One of the most significant challenges in MOF research is the gap between computational predictions and experimental synthesis. Many computationally promising MOFs might be difficult or impossible to synthesize due to limitations in current synthetic techniques. ML can address this issue by learning from datasets of both successfully synthesized MOFs and those that failed synthesis. This allows ML models to identify structural features and chemical properties that correlate with synthesizability, guiding researchers towards designing MOFs that are more likely to be realized experimentally.
- **Optimising MOFs for Drug Delivery:** ML's potential in drug delivery is noteworthy. As stated in source, "ML exhibited a unique role in MOF research to predict the properties of MOFs with less cost and time." ML models can be trained to predict **drug loading capacity** and **cytotoxicity** of MOFs. This can lead to the discovery of MOFs that can efficiently encapsulate drugs and release them in a controlled manner at the target site while exhibiting minimal toxicity.
- **Tailoring MOF Properties for Specific Needs:** ML can be used to **fine-tune MOF properties** to meet the specific requirements of an application. For instance, if a MOF with high CO2 capture ability and specific pore size is needed, ML models can predict which combinations of metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional groups are most likely to yield the desired properties.

In essence, ML methods offer a powerful approach to navigate the complexities of MOF selection. They accelerate the screening process, improve the accuracy of property prediction, and tackle the synthesizability problem, enabling researchers to efficiently identify and design suitable MOFs for diverse applications.

Large language models (LLMs) are a recent development in natural language processing that have enabled significant advancements in extracting complex data accurately. They are a type of artificial intelligence that can be used to process and understand large amounts of text data. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code and are able to perform a wide range of tasks, including:

- **generating text**,
- **translating languages**,
- **writing different kinds of creative content**, and
- **answering your questions in an informative way**.

A key advantage of LLMs is their ability to be used in a **zero-shot fashion**, meaning that they can be used to perform tasks without any prior training or fine-tuning. This makes them very versatile and adaptable, and they have been used to develop a wide range of applications in various fields, including **materials science**.

In **materials science**, LLMs are being used to automate the extraction of data from research papers. This is a time-consuming and laborious task that has traditionally been done manually. LLMs can automate this process, making it possible to extract data from large numbers of papers quickly and efficiently.

One approach to using LLMs for data extraction is called **ChatExtract**, which uses a set of engineered prompts to guide a conversational LLM to extract data from text. The prompts are designed to:

- **identify sentences with data**,
- **extract that data**, and
- **assure the data's correctness through a series of follow-up questions**.

These follow-up questions help to overcome the issue of LLMs providing factually inaccurate responses, a known problem referred to as **hallucinations**. ChatExtract has been shown to be very effective at extracting materials data from research papers, with precision and recall both close to 90% from the best conversational LLMs, such as GPT-4.
