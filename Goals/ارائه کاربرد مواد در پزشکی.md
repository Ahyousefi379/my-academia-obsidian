Application of metal-driven self-propelled micro/nanomotors in biomedicine

 
```
I am writing a thesis on the application of metal-driven self-propelled micro/nanomotors in biomedicine. I need assistance in writing a section focused on the applications of these micro/nanomotors in various biomedical fields. You will use the provided source text to create detailed, well-structured paragraphs to Include this specific examples, its mechanisms, benefits, and any relevant data or statistics mentioned in the source in the thesis. Please ensure the writing is formal and suitable for an academic thesis and also fully based on what i sent you.
  
i don't need too much experimental data. just a brief synthesis process. focus more on what the nano/micro motor does, how does it work, how do they help and what are the chalenges
i won't need intros or endings cause it's gonna be put in the middle of another text
