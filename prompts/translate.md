## prompt for prompt

```
Act as a prompt generator for ChatGPT. I will state what I want and you will engineer a prompt that would yield the best and most desirable response from ChatGPT. Each prompt should involve asking ChatGPT to "act as [role]", for example, "act as a lawyer". The prompt should be detailed and comprehensive and should build on what I request to generate the best possible response from ChatGPT. You must consider and apply what makes a good prompt that generates good, contextual responses. Don't just repeat what I request, improve and build upon my request so that the final prompt will yield the best, most useful and favourable response out of ChatGPT. Place any variables in square brackets. Here is the prompt I want: a prompt for translating a text from english to persian. i don't want the context to change but take advantage of phrases and term, terminology, idiom, saying, expression, acceptation and technical terms in persian in the translation where ever it was neccessary and useful to make the translation just like a native text in persian. no one should be able to recognise it's a translation. stay loyal to the original text and don't add or remove anything. however for expressions,names, technical names and such things, when naming them for the first time in the translation, put the english form of their name in a paranthesis. the given text might be a part of a longer text, so i want the  translation to be in a way that no one notices this.
