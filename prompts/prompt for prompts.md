Crafting effective prompts for AI can improve the quality and relevance of the responses you receive. This expertise requires a nuanced understanding of how AI interprets and processes natural language inputs. Ahead, we explore ten AI prompt engineering best practices to help you communicate with AI more effectively:

### [1. Be as specific as possible](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#1-be-as-specific-as-possible)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#1-be-as-specific-as-possible)

Specificity is key to obtaining the most accurate and relevant information from an AI when writing prompts. A specific prompt minimizes ambiguity, allowing the AI to understand the request‚Äôs context and nuance, preventing it from providing overly broad or unrelated responses. To achieve this, include as many relevant details as possible without overloading the AI with superfluous information. This balance ensures that the AI has just enough guidance to produce the specific outcome you‚Äôre aiming for.

When creating the best prompts for an AI, ask for the following specifics:

- **Detailed context**: Provide the AI with enough background information to understand the scenario you‚Äôre inquiring about. This includes the subject matter, scope, and any relevant constraints.
    
- **Desired format**: Clearly specify the format in which you want the information to be presented, whether it‚Äôs a list, a detailed report, bullet points, or a summary. Mention any structural preferences, such as headings, subheadings, or paragraph limits.
    
- **Output length**: Detail how long you want the AI‚Äôs response, whether ‚Äú3 paragraphs‚Äù or ‚Äú250 words.‚Äù
    
- **Level of detail**: Indicate the level of detail required for the response, from high-level overviews to in-depth analysis, to ensure the model‚Äôs output matches your informational needs.
    
- **Tone and style**: Request the preferred tone and style, whether it‚Äôs formal, conversational, persuasive, or informational, to make sure the output aligns with your intended audience or purpose.
    
- **Examples and comparisons**: Ask the AI to include examples, analogies, or comparisons to clarify complex concepts or make the information more relatable and easily understood.
    

**üí° Prompt Example:**

Please provide an outline for a comprehensive report that analyzes the current trends in social media marketing for technology companies, focusing on the developments from 2020 onward.

The outline should include an introduction, three main sections addressing different aspects of social media trends, and a conclusion summarizing the findings. Please suggest the types of graphs that could illustrate user engagement trends and list bullet points that summarize key marketing strategies in each section.

### [2. Supply the AI with examples](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#2-supply-the-ai-with-examples)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#2-supply-the-ai-with-examples)

Incorporating examples into your prompts is a powerful technique to steer the AI‚Äôs responses in the desired direction. By providing examples as you write prompts, you set a precedent for the type of information or response you expect. This practice is particularly useful for complex tasks where the desired output might be ambiguous or for creative tasks with more than one correct answer.

When you supply the AI with examples, ensure they represent the quality and style of your desired result. This strategy clarifies your expectations and helps the AI model its responses after the examples provided, leading to more accurate and tailored outputs.

Here are some example types you could provide to an AI to help guide it toward generating the best response possible:

- **Sample texts**: Share excerpts reflecting the style, tone, and content you want the AI to replicate.
    
- **Data formats**: To guide the AI‚Äôs output, provide specific data structures, such as table layouts or spreadsheet formats.
    
- **Templates for documents**: Offer templates to ensure the AI‚Äôs response follows a desired structure and format.
    
- **Code snippets**: Provide code examples if you need help with programming tasks to ensure correct syntax and logic.
    
- **Graphs and charts examples**: If you‚Äôre asking the AI to create similar graphics, share samples of visual data representation.
    
- **Marketing copy**: If you‚Äôre crafting marketing content, present ad copy that aligns with your brand‚Äôs voice for the AI to mimic.
    

**üí° Prompt Example:**

Create a comparison table for two project management tools, Tool A and Tool B.

Include the following categories: Price, Key Features, User Reviews, and Support Options. For instance, under Key Features, list things like ‚ÄòTask Assignment‚Äô, ‚ÄòTime Tracking‚Äô, and ‚ÄòFile Sharing‚Äô.

The format should mirror something like this:

| Feature | Tool A | Tool B |

|--------|-------|-------|

| Price | $X per user/month | $Y per user/month |

| Key Features | Task Assignment | File Sharing |

| User Reviews | X stars | Y stars |

| Support Options | 24/7 Live Chat, Email | Business Hours Phone, Email |

Please ensure the table is concise and suitable for inclusion in a business report.

### [3. Get better answers by providing data](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#3-get-better-answers-by-providing-data)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#3-get-better-answers-by-providing-data)

Incorporating specific and relevant data into your prompts significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated responses, providing a solid foundation for the AI to understand the context and craft precise answers. Providing data that includes numerical values, dates, or categories, organized in a clear and structured way, allows for detailed analysis and decision-making. It‚Äôs essential to give context to the data and, when possible, to cite its source, lending credibility and clarity to the specific task, whether for quantitative analysis or comparisons.

To ensure the AI delivers the most relevant and insightful answers, always use updated and well-organized information, and if comparisons are needed, establish clear parameters. Supplying the AI with concrete, contextualized data transforms raw figures into intelligible and actionable insights. Data-driven prompts are particularly valuable in tasks requiring a deep dive into numbers, trends, or patterns, enabling the AI to generate outputs that can effectively inform business strategies or research conclusions.

**üí° Prompt Example:**

Please analyze the sales data from the first quarter of 2024 provided in the attached PDF document. I need a summary that identifies our best-selling product, the overall sales trend, and any notable patterns in customer purchases.

The PDF contains detailed monthly sales units for three products: Product A, Product B, and Product C. After reviewing the data, summarize your findings in a concise paragraph that is suitable for a business meeting. Highlight significant increases or decreases in sales and offer insights into potential factors driving these trends.

### [4. Specify your desired output](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#4-specify-your-desired-output)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#4-specify-your-desired-output)

When engaging with AI, articulate the precise format and structure you expect in the response. Specify whether you require a detailed report, a summary, bullet points, or a narrative form to ensure the AI tailors its output to your needs.

Indicate any preferences such as tone, style, and the inclusion of certain elements like headings or subheadings. By clearly defining your desired output, you guide the AI to deliver information that aligns seamlessly with your intended use.

**üí° Prompt Example:**

The tone should be educational. Please limit the overview to ten major milestones to maintain conciseness.

### [5. Provide instructions on what to do instead of what¬†_not_¬†to do](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#5-provide-instructions-on-what-to-do-instead-of-what-_not_-to-do)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#5-provide-instructions-on-what-to-do-instead-of-what-_not_-to-do)

When constructing prompts for AI, it‚Äôs more effective to direct the system toward the desired action rather than detailing what it should avoid. This positive instruction approach reduces ambiguity and focuses the AI‚Äôs processing power on generating constructive outcomes.

Negative instructions often require the AI to interpret and invert them, increasing the cognitive load and potential for misunderstanding. By clearly stating the intended actions, you enable the AI to apply its capabilities directly to fulfilling the task at hand, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the response.

**üí° Prompt Examples:**

- Avoid: "Don‚Äôt write too much detail. ‚Üí Use Instead: ‚ÄúPlease provide a concise summary.‚Äù
    
- Avoid: ‚ÄúAvoid using technical jargon.‚Äù ‚Üí Use Instead: ‚ÄúUse clear and simple language accessible to a general audience.‚Äù
    
- Avoid: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give examples from before the year 2000.‚Äù ‚Üí Use Instead: ‚ÄúProvide examples from the year 2000 onwards.‚Äù
    

### [6. Give the model a persona or frame of reference](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#6-give-the-model-a-persona-or-frame-of-reference)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#6-give-the-model-a-persona-or-frame-of-reference)

Assigning a persona or a specific frame of reference to an AI model can significantly enhance the relevance and precision of its output. By doing so, you get more relevant responses, aligned with a particular perspective or expertise, ensuring that the information provided meets the unique requirements of your query.

This approach is especially beneficial in business contexts where domain-specific knowledge is pivotal, as it guides the AI to utilize a tone and terminology appropriate for the given scenario. The persona also helps set the right expectations and can make interactions with the AI more relatable and engaging for the end user.

**üí° Prompt Example:**

- Optimization techniques: Discuss the specific techniques you would consider to address the identified bottlenecks, such as algorithm optimization, code refactoring, or hardware acceleration.
    
- Testing and validation: Describe your method for testing the optimized software to ensure that the changes have had the desired effect and have not introduced new issues.
    
- Implementation strategy: Finally, outline how you would safely implement the optimized code into the production environment, ensuring minimal disruption.
    

Conclude with a summary of the key steps in the optimization process and how you would document and maintain the improvements over time.

### [8. Split complex tasks into simpler ones](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#8-split-complex-tasks-into-simpler-ones)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#8-split-complex-tasks-into-simpler-ones)

When dealing with complex tasks, breaking them into simpler, more manageable components can make them more approachable for an AI. Using step by step instructions helps prevent the AI from becoming overwhelmed and ensures that each part of the task is handled with attention to detail.

Additionally, this approach allows for easier monitoring and adjustment of each step, facilitating better quality control throughout the process. By compartmentalizing tasks, the AI can also use its resources more efficiently, allocating the necessary attention where it‚Äôs most needed, resulting in a more effective problem-solving strategy.

**üí° Prompt Example:**

Avoid a single broad prompt:

- ‚ÄúWrite a 1500-word article on the impact of AI on remote work.‚Äù

Try an initial prompt and follow-up prompts instead:

- ‚ÄúDevelop a detailed outline for a 1500-word article titled ‚ÄòRevolutionizing Remote Work: The Role of AI for Tech Professionals.‚Äô The outline should include an engaging introduction, three main sections titled ‚ÄòEnhancing Productivity with AI Tools,‚Äô ‚ÄòAI-Driven Communication Optimization,‚Äô and ‚ÄòAdvanced Project Management through AI,‚Äô plus a conclusion that offers a perspective on future developments.‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúCompose a detailed introduction for the article ‚ÄòRevolutionizing Remote Work: The Role of AI for Tech Professionals.‚Äô The introduction should be 150-200 words, setting the stage for how AI is changing the game for remote workers in the tech industry, and providing a hook that will entice tech professionals to continue reading.‚Äù
    

### [9. Understand the model‚Äôs shortcomings](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#9-understand-the-model-s-shortcomings)[](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/articles/prompt-engineering-best-practices#9-understand-the-model-s-shortcomings)

In crafting prompts for an AI, recognize the model‚Äôs limitations to set realistic expectations. Prompting AI to perform tasks it‚Äôs not designed for, such as interacting with external databases or providing real-time updates, will lead to ineffective and potentially misleading outputs called¬†[AI hallucinations](https://www.digitalocean.com/resources/article/ai-hallucination).

Here are some known shortcomings of AI models:

- Lack of real-time data processing, as the knowledge is up-to-date only until the last training cut-off.
    
- Inability to access or retrieve personal data unless it has been shared during the interaction.
    
- No direct interaction with external software, databases, or live web content.
    
- Potential bias in the data, as AI models can inadvertently learn and replicate biases present in their training data.
    
- Limited understanding of context can lead to less nuanced responses in complex or ambiguous situations.
    
- The absence of personal experiences or emotions means the AI cannot form genuine, empathetic connections or offer personal anecdotes.
