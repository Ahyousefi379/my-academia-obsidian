Wilson and Yunrui Hu and Fei Peng and Yingfeng Tu}, keywords = {Magnesium, Micromotor, Reactive oxygen species, Active hydrogen, Chemotherapy}, abstract = {Hydrogen therapy has recently emerged as an attractive approach for combating major diseases including cancer, diabetes, stroke and Parkinson's disease. Herein, we ingeniously fabricated a fully biodegradable Magnesium (Mg) based micromotor for the active hydrogen and chemotherapeutics delivery, and firstly proposed the concept of a self-propelled micromotor platform used for cancer active hydrogen-chemotherapy. By consuming water, the micromotor generates sufficient hydrogen in-situ, which is not only propellant for motion, but also active component for hydrogen therapy. The active motion of micromotors with a speed up to 57 ± 19 μm•s−1 leads to enhanced diffusion of produced hydrogen that allows for higher extracellular and intracellular reducibility. Compared with the non-motor control, the micromotor loaded with doxorubicin improves the chemotherapy efficacy significantly by 2.4 times for 4T1 tumor cells with a concentration as low as 100 μg•mL−1. These results indicate that the Mg-based micromotors can act as self-propelled carriers for enhanced intracellular hydrogen and cancer chemotherapy. Taking advantage of the locally hydrogen generation and the active moving capabilities, the facilely engineered Mg micromotor provides great promise for cancer synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy.} }

abstract = {Cell derivatives have received increasing attention due to their unique ability to mimic many of the natural properties displayed by their source cells. Integration of cell-derived natural materials with synthetic subjects can be applied toward the development of novel biomedical nano/microscale devices for a wide range of applications, including drug delivery and biodetoxification. Herein, a cell membrane functionalized magnesium-based Janus micromotor, powered by water, that mimics natural motile cells is reported. The new cell-mimicking Janus micromotor is constructed by integrating red blood cell (RBC) membranes, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and alginate (ALG) onto the exposed surface areas of magnesium microparticles that are partially embedded in Parafilm. The resulting RBC membrane-coated magnesium (RBC-Mg) Janus micromotors display an efficient and guided propulsion in water without any external fuel, as well as in biological (albumin-rich) media with no apparent biofouling, mimicking the movement of natural motile cells. The effective RBC membrane coating bestows the RBC-Mg Janus micromotors with unique capability for absorbing and neutralizing both biological protein toxins and nerve agent simulants. Such detoxification ability is facilitated greatly by the water-driven motion of the motors. The RBC-Mg Janus micromotors represent an exciting progress toward cell-mimicking microscale motors that hold great promise for diverse biomedical and biodefense applications.},

abstract = {A red blood cell membrane-camouflaged nanowire that can serve as new generation of biomimetic motor sponge is described. The biomimetic motor sponge is constructed by the fusion of biocompatible gold nanowire motors and RBC nanovesicles. The motor sponge possesses a high coverage of RBC vesicles, which remain totally functional due to its exclusively oriented extracellular functional portion on the surfaces of motor sponge. These biomimetic motors display efficient acoustical propulsion, including controlled movement in undiluted whole blood. The RBC vesicles on the motor sponge remain highly stable during the propulsion process, conferring thus the ability to absorb membrane-damaging toxins and allowing the motor sponge to be used as efficient toxin decoys. The efficient propulsion of the motor sponges under an ultrasound field results in accelerated neutralization of the membrane-damaging toxins. Such motor sponges connect artificial nano­motors with biological entities and hold great promise for treating a variety of injuries and diseases caused by membrane-damaging toxins.},
