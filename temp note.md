## Definition

Polymers are large molecules (macromolecules) composed of repeating structural units called monomers, connected by covalent bonds.  These repeating units, when considered within the polymer chain, are referred to as mers.  Understanding the relationship between mers, monomers, and polymers is fundamental to the study of polymer science.

## Key Points

*   **Monomer:** A small molecule that can react to form repeating units in a polymer chain.
*   **Mer:**  A repeat unit within a polymer chain.  It's derived from the monomer after polymerization.
*   **Polymer:** A large molecule consisting of many repeating mers linked together.
*   **Polymerization:** The chemical process by which monomers are linked together to form polymers.

## Detailed Explanation

### Monomers

Monomers are the building blocks of polymers. They are small molecules containing reactive functional groups that allow them to link together during polymerization.  Examples include ethylene (for polyethylene), vinyl chloride (for polyvinyl chloride - PVC), and styrene (for polystyrene).

### Mers

Once a monomer has been incorporated into a polymer chain, it is called a mer.  Think of it this way: the monomer is the raw material, and the mer is the processed unit within the finished product (the polymer).  The chemical structure of a mer is often slightly different from the original monomer due to the rearrangement of bonds during polymerization.

### Polymers

Polymers are long chains, sometimes branched or cross-linked, consisting of many repeating mers. The properties of a polymer depend on several factors, including the type of monomer used, the length of the polymer chain (degree of polymerization), and the arrangement of the mers.

### Subtopic 1: Degree of Polymerization

The degree of polymerization (DP) refers to the number of repeat units (mers) in a polymer chain.  It directly influences the polymer's properties.  Higher DP generally leads to increased strength, melting point, and viscosity.

### Subtopic 2: Types of Polymerization

There are two main types of polymerization:

*   **Addition Polymerization:** Monomers add to each other without the loss of any atoms.  This typically involves a chain reaction initiated by a free radical or an ion.
*   **Condensation Polymerization:** Monomers react to form a polymer with the elimination of a small molecule, such as water.  Examples include the formation of nylon and polyester.

## Important Formulas

*   **Degree of Polymerization (DP):**  DP = Molecular Weight of Polymer / Molecular Weight of Monomer

## Examples

*   **Ethylene (Monomer) → Polyethylene (Polymer):**  Ethylene monomers undergo addition polymerization to form polyethylene, a common plastic.  Each mer in polyethylene is a -(CH2-CH2)- unit.
*   **Vinyl Chloride (Monomer) → Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) (Polymer):** Vinyl chloride monomers polymerize to form PVC, used in pipes and flooring.
*   **Styrene (Monomer) → Polystyrene (Polymer):**  Styrene monomers polymerize to form polystyrene, used in packaging and insulation.

# Example of calculating Degree of Polymerization (DP)

polymer_molecular_weight = 100000  # Example value
monomer_molecular_weight = 104      # Example value for styrene

DP = polymer_molecular_weight / monomer_molecular_weight
print(f"The degree of polymerization is: {DP}")
