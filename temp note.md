Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions. It is inherently more complex and capable of capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

- **Logistic Regression** (used in Bagging) is a linear model. While Bagging improves its stability by combining multiple instances, the model itself remains linear. This means that its capacity to model complex relationships in the data is limited.
- **Random Forest** consists of multiple decision trees, which are inherently non-linear models. This allows Random Forest to capture more complex patterns in the data.

RF The chosen hyperparameters likely struck a good balance between complexity and generalization, leading to better performance.
