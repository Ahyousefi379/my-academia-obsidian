**Applications of Magnesium-Based Micro/Nanomotors in Biomedicine**

Magnesium (Mg)-based micromotors have demonstrated significant potential in the field of biomedicine, particularly in active and synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy. These micromotors leverage the intrinsic properties of magnesium to address several challenges in conventional cancer therapy, including drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic efficacy.

**Mechanism and Functionality**

The core mechanism of Mg-based micromotors involves the generation of hydrogen (H₂) through a reaction with water. This hydrogen not only propels the micromotors but also serves as a therapeutic agent. The Mg micromotors are designed with a Janus structure, where Mg microparticles are coated with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). This design enables controlled degradation and hydrogen release, which is crucial for maintaining propulsion and therapeutic action within biological environments.

Once introduced into the body, the Mg-based micromotors autonomously propel through body fluids by continuously generating hydrogen gas. The propulsion mechanism enhances the diffusion of hydrogen, allowing it to penetrate deeply into tissues and cells. This active motion significantly improves the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin (DOX), increasing their intracellular uptake and therapeutic efficacy. For instance, studies have shown that Mg-motor loaded with DOX enhances chemotherapy efficacy by 2.4 times in 4T1 tumor cells compared to non-motor controls at a concentration as low as 100 μg/mL【4†source】.

**Biomedical Applications and Benefits**

1. **Cancer Therapy:**
   Mg-based micromotors have been extensively explored for cancer treatment. The active hydrogen produced by these micromotors acts as a potent antioxidant, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupting the cellular redox balance in cancer cells. Elevated ROS levels in cancer cells promote tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis. By scavenging ROS, hydrogen can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. The dual action of hydrogen and drug delivery by Mg-motors provides a synergistic effect, improving overall therapeutic outcomes. 

2. **Enhanced Drug Delivery:**
   The propulsion capability of Mg-motors ensures efficient drug delivery to targeted cells. The motion enhances the penetration of drugs into cells, overcoming the limitations of passive diffusion observed in conventional drug delivery systems. This results in higher intracellular concentrations of the drug, leading to improved therapeutic efficacy. For example, the fluorescence intensity of DOX in 4T1 and HT29 cells was significantly higher when delivered via Mg-motors compared to passive carriers, indicating better drug uptake and distribution【4†source】.

3. **Minimally Invasive Procedures:**
   The use of Mg-based micromotors in minimally invasive procedures holds promise due to their ability to navigate through complex biological environments autonomously. These micromotors can be guided to specific locations within the body, reducing the need for invasive surgical procedures and minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Their biodegradability ensures that they do not accumulate in the body, further enhancing their safety profile.

**Challenges and Future Directions**

While Mg-based micromotors offer numerous benefits, there are several challenges that need to be addressed for their clinical translation. One major challenge is the precise control of motor speed and motion in the complex and variable environment of the human body. Factors such as viscosity, temperature, and the presence of biological molecules can affect the performance of the micromotors. Additionally, ensuring the biocompatibility and safety of the materials used in the micromotors is crucial for their successful application in humans.

Future research should focus on optimizing the design and functionality of these micromotors to overcome these challenges. Developing smart micromotors with responsive behavior to external stimuli, such as magnetic fields or light, could provide better control over their motion and enhance their therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, integrating advanced imaging and sensing capabilities into these micromotors could enable real-time monitoring and targeted therapy, paving the way for personalized medicine.

In conclusion, Mg-based micromotors represent a promising advancement in biomedical applications, particularly in cancer therapy and drug delivery. Their ability to actively propel and deliver therapeutic agents with high precision and efficiency holds great potential for improving the outcomes of various medical treatments. Continued research and development in this field are essential to fully realize the clinical benefits of these innovative micromotors.

### The Diseases

The diseases addressed in this study include cancer, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. These conditions are often characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play a significant role in their pathophysiology. In cancer, for instance, increased ROS levels contribute to oncogenesis, abnormal cell growth, metastasis, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis, and differentiation blocks, making them a crucial target for therapeutic interventions. Elevated ROS levels are also implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases, where they contribute to cellular damage and inflammation【6:0†source】【6:3†source】.

### Hydrogen's Effect on Disease

Hydrogen (H2) has recently gained attention as a therapeutic agent due to its potent antioxidant properties. It has been shown to scavenge cytotoxic oxygen radicals, thus inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells and disrupting cellular redox homeostasis without affecting normal cells. H2 selectively reduces highly oxidative toxic radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals, and also down-regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines while activating endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. These actions make H2 a promising therapeutic agent for diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation【6:0†source】【6:3†source】. However, the therapeutic application of H2 is limited by its nonpolarity and low solubility under physiological conditions, which hinder its effective delivery to target tissues【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

### Why Use Self-Propelled Micromotors as Therapy

Self-propelled micromotors offer a novel and effective means of delivering therapeutic agents, including hydrogen. These micromotors can convert chemical or physical energies into mechanical motion, enabling them to navigate autonomously within the body. This active motion significantly enhances the delivery and efficacy of therapeutic agents compared to passive delivery systems. For instance, in the context of cancer treatment, micromotors can improve the diffusion and penetration of drugs into tumor tissues, thereby increasing therapeutic efficacy【6:1†source】【6:4†source】. The self-propelling nature of these micromotors ensures that they can overcome biological barriers and deliver drugs more precisely and effectively to the target sites.

### The Specific Micromotor Used in This Paper

#### Materials

The specific micromotors used in this study are magnesium (Mg)-based. Magnesium was chosen due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to react with water to produce hydrogen gas, which serves both as a propellant and a therapeutic agent. The micromotors are fabricated using Mg microparticles as cores, which are then coated with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PLGA is a biodegradable polymer that enhances drug loading capacity and provides a controlled release profile for the therapeutic agents【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

#### Synthesis

The synthesis of the Mg-based micromotors involves several key steps:
1. **Preparation of Mg Microparticles:** Mg microparticles are washed with acetone to remove impurities and then dried under nitrogen flow.
2. **Coating with PLGA:** The Mg microparticles are dispersed on a glass slide pre-coated with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). A solution of PLGA or a mixture of PLGA and doxorubicin (DOX) in ethyl acetate is then used to coat the Mg microparticles asymmetrically.
3. **Formation of Mg-Motor:** The coated Mg microparticles are carefully scraped from the glass slide to form the Mg-based micromotors. The micromotors loaded with doxorubicin are referred to as Mg-motor-DOX【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

#### Results

The Mg-based micromotors demonstrated impressive therapeutic efficacy. When tested on 4T1 tumor cells, the micromotors significantly improved chemotherapy outcomes. The Mg-motor-DOX micromotors increased the efficacy of doxorubicin by 2.4 times compared to non-motor controls at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. This enhancement is attributed to the active motion of the micromotors, which leads to better diffusion and intracellular penetration of hydrogen and the chemotherapeutic agent【6:1†source】【6:4†source】. The micromotors achieved speeds of up to 57 ± 19 μm/s, facilitating enhanced extracellular and intracellular reducibility, which is crucial for effective ROS scavenging and improved therapeutic outcomes【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

In conclusion, the Mg-based micromotors developed in this study offer a promising approach for synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy. Their ability to generate hydrogen in situ and actively deliver therapeutic agents makes them highly effective in targeting and treating diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation. The significant improvements in chemotherapy efficacy observed with these micromotors highlight their potential as advanced therapeutic delivery systems.

### Self-Propelled Micromotors in This Paper

#### Materials

The self-propelled micromotors developed in this study are primarily magnesium (Mg)-based, chosen for their unique properties that facilitate both propulsion and therapeutic action. Magnesium is biocompatible and biodegradable, ensuring that the micromotors do not introduce long-term foreign materials into the body. The micromotors are fabricated using the following key materials:

1. **Magnesium Microparticles:** These serve as the core of the micromotors, providing the necessary chemical reaction for propulsion and hydrogen generation.
2. **Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA):** This biodegradable polymer is used to coat the Mg microparticles, enhancing drug loading capacity and providing a controlled release mechanism for therapeutic agents like doxorubicin (DOX).
3. **Doxorubicin (DOX):** A chemotherapeutic agent used to load the micromotors for targeted cancer therapy【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

#### Mechanism of Action

The self-propulsion mechanism of the Mg-based micromotors is driven by the reaction of magnesium with water, which produces hydrogen gas. This reaction can be summarized by the chemical equation:

\[ \text{Mg} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Mg(OH)}_2 + \text{H}_2 \]

This hydrogen generation serves two purposes:
1. **Propulsion:** The continuous production of hydrogen gas propels the micromotors forward, allowing them to navigate autonomously within the body.
2. **Therapeutic Action:** The hydrogen gas acts as an antioxidant, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and providing therapeutic benefits by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in diseased tissues【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

#### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Drug Delivery:** The active motion of the micromotors improves the diffusion and penetration of therapeutic agents into target tissues, leading to more effective treatments.
2. **Selective Targeting:** The micromotors can navigate through biological barriers and target specific areas within the body, reducing the side effects typically associated with systemic drug administration.
3. **Biodegradability:** The use of Mg and PLGA ensures that the micromotors degrade naturally within the body, minimizing long-term toxicity and the need for surgical removal.
4. **Synergistic Therapy:** The combined effect of hydrogen generation and drug delivery enhances the therapeutic efficacy, particularly in treatments requiring both antioxidant and chemotherapeutic actions【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

#### Challenges

1. **Control of Motion:** Achieving precise control over the motion and navigation of micromotors within the complex environment of the human body remains challenging. Ensuring that the micromotors reach the target tissue without premature degradation or loss of propulsion is critical.
2. **Scale-Up for Clinical Use:** While promising in laboratory settings, scaling up the production of micromotors for widespread clinical use involves significant technical and regulatory hurdles.
3. **Safety and Biocompatibility:** Although Mg and PLGA are biocompatible, comprehensive studies are required to assess long-term safety, particularly concerning the potential for local tissue reactions or systemic effects due to degradation products.
4. **Optimization of Drug Loading and Release:** Balancing the loading of therapeutic agents and their controlled release remains a technical challenge. Ensuring that the drug is released in a controlled manner at the target site is essential for maximizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

#### Additional Information

The synthesis of Mg-based micromotors involves several steps aimed at ensuring optimal performance. After preparing the Mg microparticles and coating them with PLGA, the micromotors are loaded with doxorubicin by dispersing them in a DOX solution. This approach ensures that the drug is encapsulated efficiently within the PLGA layer, providing a sustained release profile as the micromotors navigate through the body.

The study demonstrated that these micromotors could achieve significant improvements in chemotherapy outcomes. Specifically, the Mg-motor-DOX micromotors enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin by 2.4 times compared to non-motor controls at a doxorubicin concentration of 100 μg/mL. This improvement is attributed to the active propulsion of the micromotors, which facilitates better diffusion and intracellular delivery of the drug and hydrogen【6:1†source】【6:4†source】.

Overall, the use of Mg-based self-propelled micromotors represents a promising approach for enhancing the delivery and efficacy of therapeutic agents. Their ability to autonomously navigate within the body and actively deliver both hydrogen and chemotherapeutic agents offers a synergistic therapeutic strategy, particularly valuable in the treatment of diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. However, further research and development are necessary to address the challenges and optimize the performance of these micromotors for clinical applications.
