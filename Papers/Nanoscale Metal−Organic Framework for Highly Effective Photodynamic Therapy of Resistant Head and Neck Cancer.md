Singlet oxygen generation efficiencies of H 2 DBP and DBPUiO were determined using Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG, Life Technologies). After exposure to a LED light source (peak emission at 640 nm and energy irradiance of 100 mW/cm 2 ; Figure S17, SI), the chemiluminescent reagent SOSG reacted with 1 O 2 to generate green fluorescence, which was quantified with a fluorimeter. The fluorescence intensity was plotted against irradiation time (Figure 2b). The 1 O 2 generation was depicted with an exponential function that corresponded to a pseudo first-order process. The 1 O 2 generation curve was fitted with the following equation

The product of Ak in the equation is proportional to the initial rate of the reaction that indicates the $O_2$ generation efficiency
