After that, the cascade 1 O 2 production ability of mCGP was measured using singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) as the indicator. 73,74 As shown in Figure 2D, the SOSG fluorescence increased sharply after treatment with mCGP and irradiation. However, a relatively weak SOSG fluorescence was observed after using NaN 3 as the 1 O 2 quencher, and the SOSG fluorescence kept
constant at a low level in the absence of mCGP or light irradiation. These results demonstrated that mCGP could efficiently produce 1 O 2 under light. More specifically, mCGP exhibited an accurate response of 1 O 2 generation to the OFF-ON irradiation
