### The Diseases

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by autoimmune disorders, leading to lifelong suffering, pain, and severe disabilities due to the destruction of bone and cartilage. The etiology of RA remains unclear; however, increased oxidative stress marked by excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is closely associated with the disease's progression. This overproduction of ROS results in the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). These cytokines up-regulate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade hyaluronic acid, proteoglycan, and collagen, causing significant cartilage damage. Moreover, ROS directly degrade and oxidize the primary components of cartilage and bone, exacerbating the condition.

### H2 Effect on the Disease

Hydrogen (H2) has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent for diseases associated with elevated ROS levels. H2 effectively reacts with and detoxifies highly cytotoxic oxidative radicals, thereby normalizing signaling processes. Its anti-inflammatory capabilities are noteworthy, as it down-regulates the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and pro-inflammatory transcription factors. Recent studies have shown H2's therapeutic effects in RA treatment. Drinking hydrogen-rich water has demonstrated reductions in oxidative stress and disease activity in RA patients. However, the therapeutic efficacy of H2 is limited by its short retention time and extremely low solubility in body fluids, underscoring the need for a sustained and controllable release mechanism at the local disease site.

### Why Using Self-Propelled Micromotors as a Therapy

Micro/nanomotors capable of converting local or external energy into self-propulsion have garnered significant interest for their potential in targeted drug delivery and therapeutic applications. These motors offer powerful propulsion, efficient drug loading, and enhanced penetration, making them ideal for next-generation drug carriers. Despite rapid advancements, their in vivo applications have been constrained by challenges in real-time visualization and precise guidance within body fluids. The integration of precise positioning techniques, such as ultrasound guidance, holds promise for expanding their clinical use, particularly in arthritis treatment. Magnesium-based micromotors have attracted attention due to their biodegradability and sufficient propulsion in biological environments driven by the Mg-water reaction. These micromotors are well-suited for long-term and sustained H2 supply, with a high production capacity and biodegradability, making them excellent candidates for precise and sustained H2 therapy in diseased tissues.

### The Specific Micromotor Used in This Paper

The paper develops a self-propelled magnesium-hyaluronic acid micromotor (Mg-HA motor) designed for precise and sustained H2 supply in rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The Mg-HA micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating magnesium microparticles with hyaluronic acid. This coating allows the micromotors to generate hydrogen bubbles locally, which not only propel the micromotors but also serve as active agents for scavenging ROS and reducing inflammation. The synthesis involves coating Mg microparticles with hyaluronic acid to create an asymmetrical structure that facilitates propulsion and targeted H2 release.

### Mg-HA Micromotor Used in This Paper

#### Materials and Synthesis

The Mg-HA micromotors are designed with a core-shell structure, where magnesium (Mg) microparticles form the core, and hyaluronic acid (HA) serves as the shell. The choice of Mg is driven by its excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to react with water to produce hydrogen gas (H2), which is essential for the micromotor's propulsion and therapeutic functions. Hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring biopolymer in the human body, is chosen for its biocompatibility, anti-inflammatory properties, and ability to enhance lubrication and reduce friction in joints.

The synthesis process involves several key steps:
1. **Preparation of Magnesium Microparticles**: Mg microparticles are obtained and cleaned to remove any surface contaminants.
2. **Asymmetric Coating with Hyaluronic Acid**: The cleaned Mg microparticles are asymmetrically coated with HA. This asymmetry is crucial for creating an imbalance that facilitates self-propulsion. The coating is typically achieved through a dip-coating or spray-coating process, followed by drying to ensure the HA adheres firmly to the Mg particles.
3. **Functionalization and Activation**: The coated particles are further functionalized, if necessary, to enhance their stability and reactivity in the biological environment. This may involve cross-linking the HA or adding other stabilizing agents.

#### Mechanism of Action

The Mg-HA micromotors operate through the Mg-water reaction, which generates H2 bubbles:
$\text{Mg} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Mg(OH)}_2 + \text{H}_2$
The generated H2 bubbles not only provide propulsion but also serve as therapeutic agents by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reducing oxidative stress. The propulsion mechanism enables the micromotors to move efficiently within the synovial fluid of the joints, ensuring targeted delivery of H2 to the inflamed areas.

#### Therapeutic Application and Results

The efficacy of the Mg-HA micromotors was evaluated in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, which closely mimics human rheumatoid arthritis. The micromotors were injected intra-articularly (directly into the joint) and guided using ultrasound imaging to ensure precise delivery to the affected areas.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Enhanced Mobility and Penetration**: The Mg-HA micromotors exhibited efficient propulsion in the synovial fluid, enabling deep penetration into the inflamed tissues. This enhanced mobility ensures that H2 is delivered precisely where it is needed, maximizing therapeutic efficacy.
2. **Sustained Hydrogen Release**: The micromotors provided a controlled and sustained release of H2, maintaining therapeutic levels over an extended period. This sustained release is critical for chronic conditions like RA, where continuous management of inflammation and oxidative stress is required.
3. **Reduction in Inflammatory Markers**: Treatment with Mg-HA micromotors resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These reductions correlated with decreased cartilage and bone degradation.
4. **Mitigation of Joint Damage**: Histological analysis showed that joints treated with Mg-HA micromotors had less cartilage damage and bone erosion compared to untreated controls. This indicates that the micromotors effectively mitigated the destructive processes associated with RA.
5. **Biocompatibility and Safety**: The micromotors demonstrated excellent biocompatibility, with no significant adverse effects observed in the treated animals. The Mg(OH)2 by-product of the Mg-water reaction is biodegradable and safely absorbed or excreted by the body.



### Results

The Mg-HA micromotors exhibit significant therapeutic efficacy in a collagen-induced arthritis rat model. When injected intra-articularly under ultrasound guidance, the micromotors can be visualized, allowing precise delivery to the affected joints. The micromotors effectively scavenge ROS and reduce inflammation cytokine levels, relieving oxidative stress and mitigating joint damage. The study demonstrates a marked reduction in the severity of arthritis, highlighting the potential of Mg-HA micromotors for clinical translation in RA therapy. The controlled and sustained release of H2 at the disease site provides a substantial therapeutic benefit, addressing the limitations of conventional H2 therapy methods    .

### Conclusion

The Mg-HA micromotors represent a significant advancement in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, offering a novel approach that combines targeted drug delivery with sustained therapeutic effects. Their ability to self-propel, generate H2 in situ, and precisely target inflamed tissues addresses many limitations of conventional therapies. This innovative approach holds great potential for clinical translation, providing a more effective and sustained treatment option for patients suffering from RA.
