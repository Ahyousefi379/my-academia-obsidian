### navigation in blood circulation

The navigation of micro/nanomotors within blood circulation is critical for effective tumor-targeted drug delivery. Blood presents a complex environment due to its high viscosity and heterogeneous composition, which includes blood cells, proteins, and various nutrients. Traditional passive drug delivery systems rely primarily on blood flow for distribution, but micro/nanomotors, equipped with their own propulsion mechanisms, offer the potential for active and directional movement, thus enhancing the precision and efficiency of targeted delivery.

Micro/nanomotors must navigate this challenging fluidic environment, where high flow rates and the interactions with various blood components can significantly impact their propulsion performance and stability. Understanding these interactions and the underlying mechanisms is essential to optimize the functionality of micro/nanomotors in such a dynamic environment. Studies have indicated that the unique properties of blood, such as the colloidal jamming of blood cells, present significant challenges different from those encountered in simpler Newtonian fluids.

#### Examples of Micro/Nanomotors in Blood Navigation

**Magnetically Powered Nanohelices** The study by Venugopalan et al. explored the stability and motility of nanohelices in fresh human blood. These nanohelices, composed of a ferromagnetic material, were coated with a conformal cytocompatible ferrite layer to prevent degradation by blood ions. This coating ensured that the nanohelices remained stable and functional within the blood environment. Under the influence of external rotating magnetic fields, these nanohelices demonstrated both linear and rotational movement. This study was significant as it showed that, despite the complex and dynamic nature of blood, nanohelices could achieve promising motility, paving the way for their potential use in targeted drug delivery systems within the circulatory system.

**Polymersome Nanoswimmers** Joseph et al. investigated the behavior of glucose-fueled polymersomes in flowing fluids analogous to blood circulation. These polymersomes moved in response to glucose gradients, simulating conditions found near capillary barriers and central regions of blood flow. The study revealed that these nanoswimmers exhibited chemotaxis, meaning they could navigate towards higher concentrations of glucose despite varying flow rates. This ability to move directionally in response to glucose gradients is particularly relevant for targeting tumor tissues, which often exhibit elevated glucose metabolism. The findings suggested that polymersome nanoswimmers could effectively traverse the circulatory system and localize near tumor sites, enhancing drug delivery specificity and efficacy.

**Surface Microrollers** Alapan et al. developed multifunctional surface microrollers inspired by the natural behavior of leukocytes navigating through blood vessels. These microrollers were composed of spherical Janus microparticles and were capable of moving upstream in blood flow within microfluidic channels that simulated physiological conditions. The movement of these microrollers was controlled by external rotating magnetic fields. The study demonstrated that these microrollers could achieve efficient navigation and adherence within the blood vessel walls, similar to the way leukocytes migrate to sites of inflammation. This property makes them particularly suitable for targeted drug delivery to cancer cells, as they can be directed to specific locations within the vascular system.

**Sperm-Based Micromotors** Xu et al. designed hybrid sperm micromotors equipped with streamlined-horned caps (SHC) to navigate against continuous and pulsatile blood flow. These micromotors utilized the natural motility of sperm cells, augmented by the SHC, to generate high propulsive forces. This design enabled the micromotors to swim effectively through dense blood cell environments and maintain their position even in strong flows. Additionally, these sperm-based micromotors were capable of carrying drug-loaded liposomes, offering a dual function of navigation and drug delivery. The study highlighted the potential of using biological entities, such as sperm cells, as the basis for micromotor designs that could overcome the challenges posed by blood circulation.

### tumour targeting 

#### Introduction to Tumor Targeting

Tumor targeting is a critical aspect of cancer therapy that aims to deliver therapeutic agents directly to cancer cells while minimizing the impact on healthy tissues. The primary goal of tumor targeting is to increase the concentration of the drug at the tumor site, thereby enhancing its efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. This targeted approach is particularly important in chemotherapy, where conventional methods can cause severe side effects due to the non-specific distribution of chemotherapeutic agents throughout the body.

Tumor targeting exploits various unique characteristics of tumor biology, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the presence of specific surface markers on cancer cells, and the distinct microenvironment within tumors. These characteristics allow for the development of sophisticated drug delivery systems that can recognize and bind to tumor cells, penetrate the tumor tissue, and release therapeutic agents in a controlled manner.

#### Types of Tumor Targeting

1. **Passive Targeting**: Utilizes the EPR effect, where nanoparticles accumulate in tumor tissues due to leaky vasculature and poor lymphatic drainage. This method relies on the physicochemical properties of the delivery system, such as size and surface charge, to enhance accumulation at the tumor site.
   
2. **Active Targeting**: Involves the functionalization of drug delivery systems with ligands, antibodies, or peptides that specifically bind to receptors or antigens overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. This approach increases the specificity and binding affinity of the therapeutic agents to the tumor cells.

3. **Physical Targeting**: Employs external stimuli such as magnetic fields, ultrasound, or light to guide and control the localization and release of therapeutic agents at the tumor site. This method often requires the incorporation of responsive materials within the delivery system.

#### Mechanisms and Strategies for Tumor Targeting

Effective tumor targeting requires a comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment and the development of delivery systems that can navigate these complex conditions. Micro/nanomotors, with their autonomous propulsion capabilities, offer a promising solution for active and targeted drug delivery. These systems can be engineered with various functionalization strategies to enhance their targeting efficiency.

#### Examples of Micro/Nanomotors for Tumor Targeting

**Magnetic Janus Nanoparticles**
Esteban-Fernández de Ávila et al. developed magnetic Janus nanoparticles designed for targeted cancer therapy. These nanoparticles feature a dual-functional structure, with one hemisphere providing magnetic properties for external guidance and the other loaded with chemotherapeutic agents. The surface of the nanoparticles was functionalized with antibodies specific to cancer cell markers, enabling selective binding to the cancer cells. Under an external magnetic field, these nanoparticles could be directed towards the tumor site, where they selectively bound to cancer cells and released their drug payload. This dual functionality of magnetic guidance and targeted binding significantly enhances the localization of the drug, improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing off-target effects.

**Biocompatible Nanomotors**
In a study by Wang et al., biocompatible nanomotors propelled by catalase enzyme reactions were developed for targeted drug delivery. These nanomotors were coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance their stability and circulation time in the bloodstream. Additionally, the surface of the nanomotors was functionalized with ligands that bind specifically to receptors overexpressed on tumor cells. The catalase-driven propulsion mechanism enabled the nanomotors to navigate towards hypoxic regions within the tumor, where they could release their drug cargo in response to the localized hydrogen peroxide environment. This strategy exploits the unique conditions of the tumor microenvironment to achieve targeted drug delivery, ensuring that the therapeutic agents are released precisely where they are needed most.

**Hybrid Bacteria-Based Micromotors**
Alphandéry et al. investigated hybrid bacteria-based micromotors for targeted cancer therapy. These micromotors consisted of magnetotactic bacteria, which naturally navigate towards hypoxic and acidic regions typical of tumor environments. The bacteria were loaded with magnetic nanoparticles, allowing for external magnetic guidance. Once at the tumor site, the bacteria's innate chemotactic behavior facilitated deep penetration into the tumor tissue. The magnetic nanoparticles enabled controlled heating through the application of an alternating magnetic field, inducing hyperthermia and selectively killing cancer cells. This innovative approach combines the natural navigation capabilities of bacteria with the precision of magnetic guidance, offering a highly targeted and effective method for cancer therapy.

**Gold Nanowires with Drug Loading**
Wu et al. developed gold nanowires for targeted drug delivery to tumors, leveraging the high affinity of folic acid for folate receptors, which are overexpressed on many cancer cells. The gold nanowires were functionalized with folic acid and provided a large surface area for drug loading. Their plasmonic properties also allowed for imaging and tracking within the body. Upon reaching the tumor site, the folic acid-functionalized nanowires bound specifically to the cancer cells, facilitating the localized release of the chemotherapeutic agents. This method highlights the importance of surface functionalization in achieving selective targeting and effective drug delivery, as the gold nanowires' design ensures that the drugs are delivered directly to the cancer cells, reducing collateral damage to healthy tissues.

These examples illustrate the diverse strategies and sophisticated designs employed in the development of micro/nanomotors for tumor targeting. By leveraging the unique properties of the tumor microenvironment and incorporating specific targeting mechanisms, these studies demonstrate significant advancements in the field of targeted drug delivery. These innovations hold great promise for improving cancer treatment outcomes, offering more effective and less toxic therapeutic options for patients.

### 3.3. Penetration within Tumor

#### Introduction to Tumor Penetration

The successful penetration of therapeutic agents within the tumor mass is a cornerstone of effective cancer treatment. Tumors are characterized by a complex and often hostile microenvironment, including a dense extracellular matrix (ECM), irregular and poorly organized blood vessels, and elevated interstitial fluid pressure. These factors collectively create significant physical barriers that impede the uniform distribution and deep penetration of drugs, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Enhancing the penetration capabilities of micro/nanomotors is therefore essential to ensure that therapeutic agents can access and treat the entire tumor mass, including the core and hypoxic regions that are typically more resistant to treatment.

#### Mechanisms and Strategies for Tumor Penetration

To overcome these barriers, micro/nanomotors can be designed with propulsion mechanisms that enable active movement through the ECM and other components of the tumor microenvironment. Surface modifications, such as the attachment of enzymes or targeting ligands, can further enhance their ability to navigate and penetrate tumor tissues. Key strategies include enzyme-mediated ECM degradation, enhanced chemotaxis, and mechanical propulsion, each of which can significantly improve the penetration efficiency of micro/nanomotors.

#### Examples of Micro/Nanomotors for Tumor Penetration

**Enzyme-Powered Nanomotors**
One innovative strategy for enhancing tumor penetration involves the use of enzyme-powered nanomotors. Soto et al. developed nanomotors powered by urease, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. This enzymatic reaction generates a propulsion force that drives the autonomous movement of the nanomotors. The surface of these nanomotors was functionalized with collagenase, an enzyme capable of degrading collagen, a major structural component of the ECM. This dual-enzyme approach not only propels the nanomotors but also actively breaks down the ECM, facilitating deeper penetration into the tumor tissue. The collagenase activity reduces the physical barriers within the tumor, allowing for a more uniform distribution of therapeutic agents and potentially enhancing the overall efficacy of the treatment.

**Bacteria-Based Micromotors**
Another approach to enhancing tumor penetration involves the use of bacteria-based micromotors. Alapan et al. explored the potential of magnetotactic bacteria, which possess natural motility and a strong affinity for hypoxic regions commonly found within tumors. These bacteria were loaded with drug-bearing nanoparticles and guided to the tumor site using external magnetic fields. The intrinsic motility of the bacteria allowed them to navigate through the dense tumor matrix and penetrate deeply into the tumor mass. Additionally, the chemotactic behavior of the bacteria directed them towards hypoxic and necrotic areas within the tumor, regions that are often less accessible to conventional therapies. This targeted delivery approach not only enhances penetration but also ensures that therapeutic agents reach the most resistant parts of the tumor.

**Synthetic Nanomotors with Mechanical Propulsion**
Synthetic nanomotors utilizing mechanical propulsion represent another promising strategy for improving tumor penetration. Li et al. developed nanomotors powered by ultrasonic waves, which generate mechanical movement through a helical structure. These nanomotors convert ultrasonic energy into propulsion, enabling them to move through the dense and resistant tumor tissue. To further enhance their targeting capabilities, the nanomotors were functionalized with peptides that specifically bind to tumor cells. This combination of mechanical propulsion and targeted binding allows the nanomotors to effectively navigate the tumor microenvironment, penetrate deeply, and distribute therapeutic agents uniformly throughout the tumor mass.

**Swarm Behavior of Nanoparticles**
The collective behavior of nanoparticles, known as swarm behavior, can also be leveraged to improve tumor penetration. Chen et al. engineered nanoparticles that exhibit swarm-like movement in response to specific stimuli, such as changes in pH or the presence of particular enzymes. These nanoparticles were designed to aggregate and move collectively towards the tumor core. Upon reaching their target, the nanoparticles disassembled and released their drug payload. The swarm behavior significantly enhanced the penetration depth of the nanoparticles, ensuring that therapeutic agents reached all areas of the tumor, including the hard-to-reach hypoxic regions. This approach capitalizes on the collective movement and cooperative interactions among nanoparticles to overcome the physical barriers of the tumor microenvironment.

These examples underscore the diverse strategies and sophisticated designs employed to enhance the penetration capabilities of micro/nanomotors within tumors. By utilizing propulsion mechanisms, enzymatic degradation, and targeted binding, these studies highlight significant advancements in overcoming the physical barriers posed by the tumor microenvironment. These approaches hold great promise for improving the efficacy of cancer treatments, ensuring that therapeutic agents can effectively reach and treat the entire tumor mass.

### 3.4. Cellular Uptake

#### Introduction to Cellular Uptake

Cellular uptake is a crucial step in the process of drug delivery, where therapeutic agents must enter cancer cells to exert their effects. The efficiency of cellular uptake directly impacts the therapeutic efficacy of drug delivery systems. This process involves the interaction of micro/nanomotors with the cell membrane, followed by their internalization through various pathways such as endocytosis, pinocytosis, or direct penetration. Enhancing cellular uptake ensures that a sufficient concentration of the drug is delivered intracellularly, leading to more effective treatment outcomes.

#### Mechanisms and Strategies for Enhancing Cellular Uptake

To enhance cellular uptake, micro/nanomotors can be functionalized with various ligands that recognize and bind to specific receptors on the surface of cancer cells. These ligands can include peptides, antibodies, or small molecules that facilitate receptor-mediated endocytosis. Additionally, the physicochemical properties of micro/nanomotors, such as size, shape, surface charge, and hydrophobicity, play a significant role in their interaction with the cell membrane and subsequent internalization. Optimizing these properties can significantly improve the cellular uptake of therapeutic agents.

#### Examples of Micro/Nanomotors for Enhanced Cellular Uptake

**Ligand-Functionalized Nanomotors**
Ligand-functionalized nanomotors are designed to enhance cellular uptake through specific interactions with cell surface receptors. For instance, Gao et al. developed nanomotors functionalized with folic acid, a ligand that binds to folate receptors overexpressed on many cancer cells. The folic acid-functionalized nanomotors exhibited increased binding affinity and cellular uptake compared to non-functionalized nanomotors. This receptor-mediated endocytosis facilitated the internalization of the nanomotors and their drug cargo, resulting in higher intracellular drug concentrations and improved therapeutic efficacy.

**Peptide-Modified Nanomotors**
Peptides that target specific cell surface receptors can also be used to enhance cellular uptake. A study by Park et al. utilized nanomotors modified with a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) known as TAT (trans-activator of transcription). The TAT peptide facilitates the translocation of nanomotors across the cell membrane by interacting with negatively charged components of the cell surface. The TAT-modified nanomotors demonstrated significantly higher cellular uptake compared to unmodified nanomotors, leading to increased intracellular delivery of the therapeutic agents. This approach highlights the potential of using CPPs to overcome cellular barriers and enhance drug delivery.

**Size and Shape Optimization of Nanomotors**
The size and shape of nanomotors are critical factors that influence their cellular uptake. Research by Champion et al. investigated the impact of nanoparticle geometry on cellular internalization. The study found that rod-shaped nanoparticles exhibited higher uptake rates compared to spherical nanoparticles due to their larger contact area with the cell membrane. Additionally, smaller nanoparticles were more readily internalized than larger ones, likely due to their ability to better navigate the crowded extracellular environment. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing the physical characteristics of nanomotors to enhance their cellular uptake and improve therapeutic delivery.

**Surface Charge Modulation**
Surface charge is another key determinant of cellular uptake. Positively charged nanomotors are generally more readily internalized by cells due to their electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged cell membrane. A study by Zhu et al. designed nanomotors with a positively charged surface coating, which significantly enhanced their cellular uptake compared to neutral or negatively charged nanomotors. The increased uptake was attributed to the stronger electrostatic attraction between the nanomotors and the cell membrane, facilitating endocytosis. This strategy demonstrates the effectiveness of modulating surface charge to improve the intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents.

**Hydrophobicity and Hydrophilicity Balance**
Balancing hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of nanomotors can also influence their cellular uptake. Hydrophobic surfaces can enhance the interaction with the cell membrane, promoting internalization, while hydrophilic surfaces can improve circulation time and stability in the bloodstream. A study by Chen et al. created nanomotors with a mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface, achieving an optimal balance that enhanced cellular uptake while maintaining stability in biological environments. This dual property facilitated better interaction with cell membranes and improved the efficiency of drug delivery.

These examples illustrate the diverse strategies employed to enhance the cellular uptake of micro/nanomotors. By functionalizing the surface with specific ligands, optimizing physical characteristics, and modulating surface properties, researchers have made significant advancements in improving the efficiency of intracellular drug delivery. These approaches are crucial for maximizing the therapeutic potential of micro/nanomotors in cancer treatment, ensuring that therapeutic agents can effectively reach and act within cancer cells.

### 3.5. Drug Release from Carriers

#### Introduction to Drug Release Mechanisms

The release of drugs from micro/nanomotors is a critical step in ensuring the efficacy of targeted cancer therapies. After successful navigation, penetration, and cellular uptake, the therapeutic agents must be released in a controlled and sustained manner to exert their intended effects. The release mechanisms can be triggered by various internal or external stimuli, including changes in pH, temperature, enzymatic activity, or the application of light, magnetic fields, or ultrasound. The design of micro/nanomotors often incorporates these stimuli-responsive elements to achieve precise control over the drug release process, thereby enhancing the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing side effects.

#### Strategies for Controlled Drug Release

1. **pH-Responsive Release**: Tumors often exhibit an acidic microenvironment compared to normal tissues. pH-responsive nanomotors can exploit this characteristic by releasing their drug cargo in response to the lower pH within tumors.
2. **Enzyme-Responsive Release**: Specific enzymes present in the tumor microenvironment can trigger the release of drugs from nanomotors. This approach ensures that drug release occurs only in the presence of target enzymes.
3. **Temperature-Responsive Release**: Hyperthermia or increased local temperatures can be used to trigger drug release from thermosensitive nanomotors, which release their cargo upon heating.
4. **Light-Triggered Release**: Light-sensitive nanomotors can release their drugs upon exposure to specific wavelengths of light, allowing for spatial and temporal control over drug delivery.
5. **Magnetic and Ultrasound-Triggered Release**: External magnetic fields or ultrasound waves can be used to induce drug release from responsive nanomotors, providing non-invasive control over the release process.

#### Examples of Drug Release Mechanisms

**pH-Responsive Nanomotors**
A study by Dong et al. developed pH-responsive nanomotors designed to release their drug payload in the acidic microenvironment of tumors. These nanomotors were constructed with a coating of pH-sensitive polymers that degrade or change conformation at low pH levels, thereby releasing the encapsulated drugs. The pH-sensitive coating ensures that the drug release is triggered specifically within the tumor site, minimizing the release in normal tissues and reducing systemic side effects. The effectiveness of these nanomotors was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, showing significant tumor shrinkage and improved therapeutic outcomes.

**Enzyme-Responsive Nanomotors**
Enzyme-responsive drug release mechanisms utilize the elevated levels of specific enzymes in the tumor microenvironment to trigger drug release. For instance, Chen et al. designed nanomotors with a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive coating. MMPs are enzymes overexpressed in many types of cancer and play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis. The MMP-sensitive nanomotors remain stable in circulation but release their drug payload upon encountering MMPs in the tumor microenvironment. This targeted release mechanism ensures that the drug is released precisely where it is needed, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reducing off-target effects.

**Temperature-Responsive Nanomotors**
Thermosensitive nanomotors have been engineered to release their drug cargo in response to elevated temperatures, which can be induced by localized hyperthermia. Li et al. developed nanomotors with a thermosensitive lipid coating that melts at slightly above body temperature. These nanomotors can be guided to the tumor site, where localized heating (e.g., through infrared irradiation) causes the lipid coating to melt and release the encapsulated drugs. This method allows for precise spatial control of drug release, targeting the tumor site while sparing healthy tissues.

**Light-Triggered Nanomotors**
Light-sensitive nanomotors can achieve controlled drug release through the application of specific wavelengths of light. For example, a study by Wu et al. designed gold nanorods functionalized with a light-sensitive polymer. Upon exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light, the polymer undergoes a conformational change, releasing the encapsulated drug. The use of NIR light, which can penetrate deeper into tissues compared to visible light, allows for non-invasive triggering of drug release. This method provides precise temporal control, enabling on-demand drug release at the tumor site.

**Magnetic and Ultrasound-Triggered Nanomotors**
Magnetic and ultrasound-responsive nanomotors offer non-invasive external control over drug release. Xu et al. developed magnetic nanomotors coated with a polymer that responds to alternating magnetic fields. The application of an external magnetic field induces vibrations in the polymer, leading to the release of the drug. Similarly, Wang et al. designed nanomotors that release drugs upon exposure to focused ultrasound waves. The ultrasound waves induce mechanical stress in the nanomotors, causing them to release their payload. These approaches allow for precise external control over drug release, enhancing the flexibility and effectiveness of the treatment.

These examples highlight the innovative strategies and sophisticated designs employed to achieve controlled and targeted drug release from micro/nanomotors. By leveraging various stimuli-responsive mechanisms, researchers have developed advanced drug delivery systems that ensure the precise and efficient release of therapeutic agents within the tumor microenvironment. These approaches hold great promise for improving the efficacy of cancer treatments, reducing side effects, and providing personalized therapy options for patients.

### 3.6. Micro/Nanomotors for Gastrointestinal Drug Delivery

#### Introduction to Gastrointestinal Drug Delivery

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract presents a unique and challenging environment for drug delivery. It involves complex physiological conditions such as varying pH levels, the presence of digestive enzymes, and constant peristaltic movements. Effective drug delivery systems must navigate these challenges to ensure that therapeutic agents are delivered to specific sites within the GI tract, such as the stomach, small intestine, or colon. Micro/nanomotors offer promising solutions for targeted and controlled drug delivery within the GI tract due to their ability to actively propel themselves, navigate complex environments, and respond to various physiological stimuli.

#### Mechanisms and Strategies for Gastrointestinal Drug Delivery

Micro/nanomotors designed for GI drug delivery often incorporate propulsion mechanisms that allow them to move against the flow of GI fluids and adhere to specific sites. They can be functionalized with pH-sensitive coatings, enzyme-sensitive polymers, or targeting ligands to achieve site-specific drug release. The propulsion can be driven by chemical reactions, magnetic fields, or external stimuli such as light or ultrasound, enabling precise control over their movement and drug release profiles.

#### Examples of Micro/Nanomotors for Gastrointestinal Drug Delivery

**Magnesium-Based Micromotors**
Magnesium-based micromotors have shown great potential for GI drug delivery due to their biocompatibility and self-propulsion capabilities. A study by Karshalev et al. developed magnesium-based micromotors coated with a pH-sensitive polymer. These micromotors generate hydrogen bubbles through a reaction with water, propelling them forward. The pH-sensitive coating ensures that the micromotors remain stable in the acidic environment of the stomach but dissolve in the neutral pH of the small intestine, releasing their drug payload precisely at the target site. This targeted release improves the bioavailability of the drug and minimizes systemic side effects.

**Helicobacter pylori-Targeting Micromotors**
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Targeting this bacterium within the stomach is crucial for effective treatment. Research by Gao et al. developed micromotors functionalized with urease, an enzyme that H. pylori produces to neutralize stomach acid. These urease-functionalized micromotors can navigate the acidic environment of the stomach and adhere to the gastric mucosa where H. pylori resides. The active propulsion and targeting capabilities of these micromotors enhance the local concentration of antibiotics, improving the eradication of H. pylori and reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance.

**Enzyme-Responsive Nanomotors**
Enzyme-responsive nanomotors designed to release drugs in response to specific enzymes present in the GI tract offer another promising approach. A study by de Ávila et al. developed nanomotors coated with a polymer sensitive to trypsin, a digestive enzyme found in the small intestine. These nanomotors remain intact in the stomach but release their drug payload upon encountering trypsin in the small intestine. This targeted release ensures that the drug is delivered specifically to the desired site, enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing potential side effects associated with systemic drug distribution.

**Magnetic Nanomotors for Colon Targeting**
Magnetic nanomotors can be directed to specific sites within the GI tract using external magnetic fields. Li et al. developed magnetic nanomotors coated with a mucoadhesive polymer to enhance their retention in the colon. The application of an external magnetic field guides the nanomotors to the colon, where they adhere to the mucosal lining and release their drug payload in a controlled manner. This approach is particularly useful for treating inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, where localized drug delivery can reduce inflammation and promote healing.

**Light-Activated Nanomotors**
Light-activated nanomotors offer precise control over drug release through the application of light. A study by Wu et al. developed gold nanoparticle-based nanomotors functionalized with a light-sensitive polymer. Upon exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light, the polymer undergoes a conformational change, releasing the encapsulated drug. The use of NIR light, which can penetrate deeper into tissues compared to visible light, allows for non-invasive triggering of drug release at specific sites within the GI tract. This method provides spatial and temporal control over drug delivery, enhancing therapeutic outcomes and reducing systemic side effects.

These examples demonstrate the diverse strategies and innovative designs employed to enhance drug delivery within the GI tract using micro/nanomotors. By leveraging various propulsion mechanisms and stimuli-responsive elements, researchers have developed advanced drug delivery systems that can navigate the complex GI environment, adhere to specific sites, and release therapeutic agents in a controlled and targeted manner. These approaches hold great promise for improving the treatment of GI diseases, enhancing drug bioavailability, and reducing systemic side effects.

### 4. Combination Therapy of Micro/Nanomotors

#### Introduction to Combination Therapy

Combination therapy involves the simultaneous use of multiple therapeutic agents to enhance the efficacy of treatment, reduce drug resistance, and minimize side effects. In cancer treatment, combination therapy can include a mix of chemotherapeutic drugs, gene therapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. Micro/nanomotors offer a versatile platform for combination therapy due to their ability to be engineered for multimodal functions, precise targeting, and controlled release of multiple therapeutic agents. The active propulsion and targeting capabilities of micro/nanomotors further enhance the effectiveness of combination therapies by ensuring that therapeutic agents reach the tumor site in a coordinated and controlled manner.

#### Mechanisms and Strategies for Combination Therapy

Micro/nanomotors can be designed to carry multiple drugs or therapeutic agents, each with distinct mechanisms of action. These agents can be released in a controlled sequence or simultaneously, depending on the therapeutic requirements. The integration of various functional components within a single micro/nanomotor system enables the simultaneous execution of multiple therapeutic modalities. This multimodal approach can significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy and overcome the limitations of single-agent therapies.

#### Examples of Combination Therapy Using Micro/Nanomotors

**Chemo-Photothermal Therapy Nanomotors**
Chemo-photothermal therapy (CPT) combines chemotherapy and photothermal therapy (PTT) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy against tumors. A study by Wang et al. developed gold nanorod-based nanomotors functionalized with doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic drug. The gold nanorods serve as photothermal agents that convert near-infrared (NIR) light into heat, inducing localized hyperthermia and enhancing the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon NIR light exposure, the nanomotors generate heat, increasing the permeability of cancer cell membranes and facilitating the uptake of doxorubicin. This combination therapy demonstrated significantly higher tumor cell apoptosis and tumor shrinkage compared to individual treatments.

**Chemo-Photodynamic Therapy Nanomotors**
Chemo-photodynamic therapy (CPDT) integrates chemotherapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT), where photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light activation to induce cell death. Xu et al. developed nanomotors loaded with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel and a photosensitizer. These nanomotors actively navigate to the tumor site and, upon light activation, produce ROS that cause oxidative damage to cancer cells. Simultaneously, paclitaxel disrupts cell division, resulting in a synergistic therapeutic effect. The combined action of ROS and paclitaxel enhances the overall antitumor efficacy, leading to improved treatment outcomes.

**Gene-Chemotherapy Nanomotors**
Gene therapy can be combined with chemotherapy to target cancer cells at the genetic level while simultaneously administering cytotoxic drugs. A study by Huang et al. developed nanomotors co-loaded with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting a specific oncogene and a chemotherapeutic drug. The siRNA silences the expression of the oncogene, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, while the chemotherapeutic drug induces cell death. The nanomotors' active propulsion ensures efficient delivery of both therapeutic agents to the tumor site, resulting in enhanced gene silencing and cytotoxic effects. This dual approach provides a powerful strategy for overcoming drug resistance and achieving more effective cancer treatment.

**Immuno-Chemotherapy Nanomotors**
Combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy can boost the immune response against tumors while directly killing cancer cells. Li et al. developed nanomotors functionalized with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a chemotherapeutic drug. The immune checkpoint inhibitor blocks the signals that allow cancer cells to evade the immune system, while the chemotherapeutic drug kills cancer cells directly. The nanomotors' targeted delivery enhances the local concentration of both agents at the tumor site, promoting a robust immune response and reducing tumor burden. This combination therapy showed improved survival rates and reduced tumor growth in preclinical models.

**Magnetic-Guided Combination Therapy Nanomotors**
Magnetic nanomotors can be directed to specific tumor sites using external magnetic fields, allowing for precise localization of therapeutic agents. A study by Zhang et al. developed magnetic nanomotors loaded with a combination of chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers. The application of an external magnetic field guides the nanomotors to the tumor site, where they release their payload upon light activation. This approach enables the simultaneous application of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, resulting in enhanced tumor cell death. The magnetic guidance ensures that the therapeutic agents are concentrated at the tumor site, reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic outcomes.

These examples illustrate the diverse and innovative strategies employed in combination therapy using micro/nanomotors. By integrating multiple therapeutic agents and leveraging the active propulsion and targeting capabilities of micro/nanomotors, researchers have developed advanced treatment modalities that offer significant improvements in cancer therapy. These combination therapies provide a multifaceted approach to overcoming the complexities of cancer treatment, enhancing therapeutic efficacy, and minimizing side effects.
