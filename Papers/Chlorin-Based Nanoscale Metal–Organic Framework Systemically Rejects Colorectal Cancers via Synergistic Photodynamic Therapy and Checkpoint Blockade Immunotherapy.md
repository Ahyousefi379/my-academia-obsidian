Singlet oxygen generation

A light-emitting diode (LED) array with peak emission at 650 nm was used as the
light source for singlet oxygen generation. The irradiance of LED was 20 mW/cm2.
Singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) reagent (Life Technologies) was employed to detect
singlet oxygen. H4TBP, H4TBC, TBP-Hf and TBC-Hf samples were prepared in 1 uM
solutions/suspensions in water (for the nMOFs, the concentration was calculated as
ligand equivalents). To 2 mL of these solutions/suspensions, SOSG stock solution (5 uL
at 5 mM) was added (final concentration=12.5 uM) before fluorescence measurement.
For a typical measurement, fluorescence intensity was acquired on a
spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5301PC, Shimadzu, Japan) with excitation at 504 nm and
emission at 525 nm (slit width 1.5 nm/3 nm for ex/em). Fluorescence was measured after
irradiation by LED for 0 (as background), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 min.
