### Introduction and Theoretical Background

#### Overview of Nanomotors

The field of nanotechnology has significantly evolved, focusing on the development of synthetic nanomotors inspired by biological systems. Nanomotors are tiny devices capable of converting various forms of energy into mechanical motion, and they hold considerable potential for a wide range of applications, including targeted drug delivery, biodetoxification, and biosensing.

#### Biomimetic Nanomotors for Biodetoxification and Biomedical Applications

**Introduction**

In recent years, the development of biomimetic nanomotors has garnered significant attention due to their ability to mimic the complex functionalities of natural biological systems. These nanomotors are designed to integrate synthetic and biological components, creating hybrid structures that exhibit enhanced biocompatibility, functionality, and efficiency. This approach has led to notable advancements, particularly in applications such as biodetoxification and targeted drug delivery【8:0†source = همین】【8:1†source】.

One prominent example is the use of cell-membrane-coated synthetic nanomotors for effective biodetoxification. By coating synthetic nanomotors with red blood cell (RBC) membranes, researchers have created devices that combine the advantages of synthetic propulsion with the biocompatibility and functionality of biological membranes. These RBC membrane-coated nanomotors can attract and absorb various membrane-damaging toxins, offering superior biocompatibility and efficient propulsion in biological fluids【8:0†source】.

Another innovative development is the water-powered cell-mimicking Janus micromotor. This micromotor is constructed by integrating RBC membranes, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and alginate (ALG) onto magnesium microparticles. The resulting RBC membrane-coated magnesium (RBC-Mg) Janus micromotors exhibit efficient and guided propulsion in water and biological media, mimicking the movement of natural motile cells. These micromotors are designed to absorb and neutralize both biological protein toxins and nerve agent simulants, facilitated by their water-driven motion【8:1†source】【8:2†source】.

**Theoretical Background**

The integration of biological entities into synthetic nanomotors enhances their interaction with biological environments, improving their efficacy and functionality. The use of RBC membranes provides a biocompatible and functional coating that allows nanomotors to navigate through complex biological fluids and effectively neutralize toxins. This is achieved through dynamic movement, which significantly enhances the interactions between the toxins and the nanomotors, leading to accelerated toxin neutralization compared to traditional, non-motile toxin sponges【8:0†source】【8:1†source】.

The propulsion mechanisms of these biomimetic nanomotors are also critical to their functionality. In the case of RBC-Mg Janus micromotors, the propulsion is driven by the interaction between water and the magnesium core, generating hydrogen bubbles that propel the micromotor. The incorporation of RBC membranes on the surface of these micromotors allows them to evade biofouling and operate effectively in biological environments. Additionally, gold nanoparticles play a crucial role in maintaining propulsion efficiency by participating in a macrogalvanic corrosion process that enhances the micromotors' movement【8:1†source】【8:2†source】.

#### Development and Fabrication of RBC-Membrane-Coated Nanomotors

The innovative development of RBC-membrane-coated synthetic nanomotors represents a significant breakthrough in the field of nanotechnology. The process begins with the synthesis of the synthetic nanomotor core, typically crafted from materials such as polystyrene, gold, and platinum, designed to provide a stable and efficient base for further modifications.

The base nanomotors are synthesized using a layer-by-layer assembly technique. Initially, polystyrene beads are coated with a thin layer of gold (Au) using an electroless deposition method. Subsequently, a layer of platinum (Pt) is deposited onto one side of the gold-coated beads, creating a Janus particle with distinct catalytic properties. The platinum side acts as a catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is used as a fuel for propulsion.

The RBC membranes are obtained from fresh human blood samples through a process that involves the isolation of RBCs followed by a series of treatments to remove the internal components, leaving behind the membrane shells. The membranes are then purified and prepared for coating. This preparation includes steps such as hypotonic lysis to rupture the RBCs and centrifugation to isolate the membrane fragments. The resulting membrane vesicles are then washed and stored in a buffer solution until use.

The coating of the synthetic nanomotors with RBC membranes is achieved through a combination of physical adsorption and electrostatic interactions. The surface of the synthetic nanomotors is modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance biocompatibility and facilitate membrane coating. PEGylation is achieved by incubating the nanomotors in a solution of PEG-thiol (MW 5000) for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by thorough washing with PBS. The PEGylated nanomotors are then mixed with the prepared RBC membrane vesicles in a ratio that ensures uniform coating. The mixture is incubated at 4°C for 24 hours under gentle agitation, allowing the RBC membranes to spontaneously adhere to the surface of the nanomotors through physical adsorption and electrostatic interactions. The coated nanomotors are centrifuged to remove unbound membranes and resuspended in PBS for further use.

#### Mechanism of Action

The propulsion mechanism of these nanomotors is based on the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2). The reaction occurs on the platinum-coated side of the Janus particle, generating bubbles of oxygen that propel the nanomotor forward. The asymmetric distribution of catalytic material (platinum) creates a directional thrust as oxygen bubbles are generated predominantly on one side of the nanomotor. This self-generated thrust propels the nanomotor through the fluid medium.

The RBC membranes on the nanomotors provide a natural affinity for binding membrane-damaging toxins. This includes a variety of bacterial toxins, chemical agents, and protein toxins. The mechanism involves the adsorption of toxins through receptor-ligand interactions, facilitated by the RBC membrane coating which mimics the natural cellular environment. The dynamic movement of the nanomotors increases the frequency of encounters between the nanomotors and toxins, significantly enhancing the rate of toxin neutralization. Once bound, the toxins are neutralized either through sequestration or by promoting their degradation, reducing their harmful effects on the host.

One of the critical advantages of using RBC membranes is their inherent biocompatibility and ability to evade the body's immune response. The RBC membrane coating provides a 'stealth' characteristic, allowing the nanomotors to circulate in the bloodstream without being recognized and attacked by the immune system. This ensures that the nanomotors remain active for longer periods, enhancing their effectiveness in biodetoxification applications.

#### Applications and Potential Uses

The primary application of RBC-membrane-coated nanomotors is in biodetoxification, where their ability to dynamically interact with and neutralize a wide range of toxins is leveraged. These nanomotors can be used to detoxify biological fluids by neutralizing toxins released by pathogenic bacteria, such as those causing sepsis. Their high efficiency in toxin binding and neutralization makes them ideal for applications in emergency medicine and toxicology, where rapid detoxification is crucial. The nanomotors can effectively bind and neutralize toxins produced by bacteria, reducing their harmful effects and aiding in the treatment of bacterial infections. This is particularly useful in cases of severe infections where toxin buildup can lead to systemic inflammatory responses. In cases of poisoning or exposure to harmful chemical agents, these nanomotors can be introduced into the bloodstream to absorb and neutralize the toxins, reducing their impact on the body. Their ability to move through biological fluids and interact with toxins makes them suitable for treating bloodstream infections and septicemia by directly targeting and neutralizing circulating toxins.

Beyond biodetoxification, these nanomotors have significant potential in various biomedical applications due to their unique properties. The propulsion capability and biocompatibility of these nanomotors make them suitable for delivering therapeutic agents to specific sites within the body. This targeted approach enhances the efficacy of treatments while minimizing side effects. The nanomotors can be loaded with drugs and directed to specific tissues or cells, releasing the drugs in a controlled manner. These nanomotors can be engineered to carry diagnostic agents, allowing for targeted delivery and improved imaging or sensing of specific biological markers. This can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnostic procedures. The toxin-neutralizing capability of these nanomotors can be extended to therapeutic applications where they modulate the biological environment. For instance, in the treatment of inflammatory diseases or cancer, these nanomotors can be designed to neutralize pro-inflammatory cytokines or tumor-associated antigens.

### Case Study: Water-Powered Cell-Mimicking Janus Micromotors

The development of water-powered cell-mimicking Janus micromotors signifies a pioneering step in the realm of nanotechnology and bioengineering. These micromotors are designed to harness the propulsion capabilities of water decomposition while mimicking biological cells, combining synthetic and biological elements to achieve enhanced functionality and biocompatibility.

The synthesis of these Janus micromotors involves the creation of a dual-functional particle capable of catalytic propulsion and biomimetic interaction. The core of the micromotors is typically made from silica (SiO2) microspheres, chosen for their stability and ease of surface modification. Monodisperse silica microspheres are prepared using the Stöber method, which involves hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in an ammonia solution. The resulting silica microspheres serve as a robust and chemically inert core for subsequent modifications. The silica microspheres are partially coated with a thin layer of platinum using an electron-beam evaporation technique, creating a Janus structure with distinct catalytic and non-catalytic hemispheres. A titanium adhesion layer is deposited between the silica and platinum to enhance coating stability. The platinum hemisphere acts as a catalyst for the decomposition of water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), which powers the micromotor.

The cell-mimicking membranes are designed to enhance the biocompatibility and functionality of the micromotors by incorporating biological elements. These membranes are derived from cell-derived vesicles that retain key surface proteins and lipids. HeLa cells (a widely used cell line in biomedical research) are cultured in standard conditions and harvested at confluence. The cells are lysed using a hypotonic buffer to release cellular components, and the membrane fragments are isolated by differential centrifugation. The isolated membranes are further purified by ultracentrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove cytoplasmic contaminants. The purified cell membranes are then extruded through a polycarbonate membrane to form uniform vesicles. This ensures that the vesicles are of consistent size and suitable for coating the micromotors.

The process of coating the Janus micromotors with cell-mimicking membranes involves the functionalization of the silica surface and the application of the membrane vesicles. The silica surface of the micromotors is modified with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) to introduce amino groups, which facilitate membrane attachment. The silica microspheres are incubated with APTES in an ethanol solution, followed by washing and drying. The functionalized Janus micromotors are mixed with the cell-derived membrane vesicles under controlled conditions to ensure uniform coating. The mixture is incubated at 4°C with gentle agitation to promote the adhesion of the membrane vesicles to the micromotor surface through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The coated micromotors are centrifuged to remove excess vesicles and resuspended in PBS for further use.

The propulsion mechanism of these water-powered Janus micromotors is based on the catalytic decomposition of water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The reaction occurs on the platinum-coated hemisphere of the Janus particle, generating oxygen bubbles that propel the micromotor forward. The asymmetric distribution of the catalytic material (platinum) creates a directional thrust as oxygen bubbles are generated predominantly on one side of the micromotor. This self-generated thrust propels the micromotor through aqueous environments.

The cell-mimicking membranes provide a biocompatible interface that enhances interactions with biological environments. These membranes mimic the natural cellular surfaces, allowing the micromotors to interact with cells and biological molecules more effectively. This includes specific binding interactions facilitated by surface proteins and lipids retained from the original cell membranes. The dynamic movement of the micromotors increases the likelihood of encountering and interacting with target cells or molecules, enhancing their functional capabilities in biomedical applications.

The primary application of water-powered cell-mimicking Janus micromotors lies in targeted drug delivery, where their ability to navigate biological environments and interact with specific cells or tissues is leveraged. These micromotors can be used to deliver therapeutic agents directly to target sites, improving treatment efficacy while minimizing side effects. The propulsion capability of these micromotors makes them ideal for applications requiring active movement through biological fluids. Their biocompatibility and functional membrane coating allow for targeted interaction with specific cells, making them suitable for precision medicine. In drug delivery, these micromotors can be loaded with drugs and directed to specific tissues or cells, releasing the drugs in a controlled manner. The cell-mimicking membrane coating facilitates targeted delivery by enhancing the interaction with target cells through receptor-mediated binding.

Additionally, these micromotors hold potential in diagnostic applications. They can be engineered to carry diagnostic agents, allowing for targeted delivery and improved imaging or sensing of specific biological markers. This targeted approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of diagnostic procedures. The water-powered propulsion mechanism also makes these micromotors suitable for environmental applications, such as water purification. Their ability to move through aqueous environments and interact with pollutants can be harnessed for targeted removal or neutralization of contaminants. In therapeutic applications, the cell-mimicking Janus micromotors can be used to modulate the biological environment. For instance, in cancer treatment, these micromotors can be designed to deliver anticancer drugs directly to tumor cells, enhancing the efficacy of the treatment while reducing systemic side effects. Similarly, in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, the micromotors can be engineered to deliver anti-inflammatory agents to specific sites, modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation.

In summary, the development of water-powered cell-mimicking Janus micromotors represents a significant advancement in nanotechnology and biomedical engineering. By combining the propulsion capabilities of synthetic materials with the biocompatibility and functionality of cell-derived membranes, these micromotors offer a versatile and effective solution for a range of biomedical applications. Their innovative design and efficient mechanisms of action hold great promise for future therapeutic and diagnostic applications, paving the way for new approaches to treating and managing complex medical conditions.
