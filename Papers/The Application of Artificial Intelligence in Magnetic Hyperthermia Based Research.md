ABSTRACT = {The development of nanomedicine involves complex nanomaterial research involving magnetic nanomaterials and their use in magnetic hyperthermia. The selection of the optimal treatment strategies is time-consuming, expensive, unpredictable, and not consistently effective. Delivering personalized therapy that obtains maximal efficiency and minimal side effects is highly important. Thus, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based algorithms provide the opportunity to overcome these crucial issues. In this paper, we briefly overview the significance of the combination of AI-based methods, particularly the Machine Learning (ML) technique, with magnetic hyperthermia. We considered recent publications, reports, protocols, and review papers from Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection databases, considering the PRISMA-S review methodology on applying magnetic nanocarriers in magnetic hyperthermia. An algorithmic performance comparison in terms of their types and accuracy, data availability taking into account their amount, types, and quality was also carried out. Literature shows AI support of these studies from the physicochemical evaluation of nanocarriers, drug development and release, resistance prediction, dosing optimization, the combination of drug selection, pharmacokinetic profile characterization, and outcome prediction to the heat generation estimation. The papers reviewed here clearly illustrate that AI-based solutions can be considered as an effective supporting tool in drug delivery, including optimization and behavior of nanocarriers, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the delivery process. Moreover, the direction of future research, including the prediction of optimal experiments and data curation initiatives has been indicated.},
