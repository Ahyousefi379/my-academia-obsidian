abstract  ="The nonradiative conversion of light energy into heat (photothermal therapy{,} PTT) or sound energy (photoacoustic imaging{,} PAI) has been intensively investigated for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer{,} respectively. By taking advantage of nanocarriers{,} both imaging and therapeutic functions together with enhanced tumour accumulation have been thoroughly studied to improve the pre-clinical efficiency of PAI and PTT. In this review{,} we first summarize the development of inorganic and organic nano photothermal transduction agents (PTAs) and strategies for improving the PTT outcomes{,} including applying appropriate laser dosage{,} guiding the treatment via imaging techniques{,} developing PTAs with absorption in the second NIR window{,} increasing photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE){,} and also increasing the accumulation of PTAs in tumours. Second{,} we introduce the advantages of combining PTT with other therapies in cancer treatment. Third{,} the emerging applications of PAI in cancer-related research are exemplified. Finally{,} the perspectives and challenges of PTT and PAI for combating cancer{,} especially regarding their clinical translation{,} are discussed. We believe that PTT and PAI having noteworthy features would become promising next-generation non-invasive cancer theranostic techniques and improve our ability to combat cancers."}
