The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), managed by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC), contains an extensive collection of crystal structures demonstrating the features of various metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their properties. Currently, the OIF CSD database contains more than 100,000 structures, of which more than 12,000 are available for free use without restrictions  Another MOF database is CoRE MOF, which contains MOF structures derived from computer calculations. CoRE MOFs and CSD refer to databases containing already synthesized (real) MOFs. However, many databases contain only hypothetical MOFs (hMOFs)  MOF databases can be used to perform molecular dynamics calculations and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. (MD) predict new MOF structures using computer technology, statistics and probability theory. The properties of MOFs can be predicted using such models after studying characteristics such as the ability to store gases, separate and adsorb on the surface . Software packages such as topology-based crystal designers (ToBaCCo) provide another set of tools for creating MOFs with a high degree of order. These programs connect the building blocks of the MOF using data obtained from extensive databases . A conventional method for screening various data to find MOFs with desired properties could be high-throughput computer screening
