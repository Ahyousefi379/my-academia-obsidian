Detection methods for
O2​
are divided into direct and indirect methods. Direct detection, considered the “gold standard” for photodynamic therapy (PDT) dosimetry, involves measuring
O2​
luminescence at 1270 nm. However, due to its low emission probability and short lifetime in biological environments, direct detection is challenging. High-sensitivity near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors, combined with time-resolved counting techniques, are crucial for accurate detection. Key NIR detectors include photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), InGaAs/InP single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs).
