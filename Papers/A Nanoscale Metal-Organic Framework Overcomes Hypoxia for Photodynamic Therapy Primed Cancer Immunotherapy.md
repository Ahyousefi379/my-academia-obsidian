Oxygen generaton. 150 µM of H2O2 was incubated with 50 µM of Fe-TBP in oxygen-free PBS at 37 °C, followed by measuring the dissolved O2 concentration with an oxygen meter (Xylem, USA) at 5 minute intervals for one hour.

Singlet oxygen generation Singlet oxygen generation under normoxic condition. Fe-TBP, Hf-TBP, or H4TBP suspension was prepared with an equivalent ligand dose of 5 μM in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). To 2 mL each of these suspensions, SOSG stock solution (5 µL at 5 mM) was added (final concentration=12.5 µM) before fluorescence measurements. The mixed solution was exposed to LED light (100 mW, 650 nm) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300, and 420 seconds and the fluorescence at different time points was measured by a fluorimeter.

Singlet oxygen generation under hypoxic condition. Fe-TBP, Hf-TBP, or H4TBP suspension was prepared at an equivalent ligand dose of 5 μM in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). To 2 mL each of these three suspensions, SOSG stock solution and H2O2 was added to afford a final SOSG concentration of 12.5 µM and H2O2 concentration of 100 µM. Another control group was prepared by adding only SOSG stock solution to Fe-TBP suspension without H2O2. Oxygen was then removed from these four mixtures by bubbling in nitrogen for 20 mins. These mixtures were subsequently exposed to an LED (100 mW, 650 nm) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300, and 420 seconds. The fluorescence at different time points was measured by a fluorimeter
