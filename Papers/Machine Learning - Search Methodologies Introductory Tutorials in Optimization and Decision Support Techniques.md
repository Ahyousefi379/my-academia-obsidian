abstract="Machine learning is a very active sub-field of artificial intelligence concerned with the development of computational models of learning. Machine learning is inspired by the work in several disciplines: cognitive sciences, computer science, statistics, computational complexity, information theory, control theory, philosophy and biology. Simply speaking, machine learning is learning by machine. From a computational point of view, machine learning refers to the ability of a machine to improve its performance based on previous results. From a biological point of view, machine learning is the study of how to create computers that will learn from experience and modify their activity based on that learning as opposed to traditional computers whose activity will not change unless the programmer explicitly changes it.",
