To find the average of the estimation through the given Parzen window, we need to calculate the convolution of the probability density function $p(x)$ with the window function $\phi(x)$. The convolution is defined as:

$\hat{p}(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(y) \phi(x-y) dy$

Given:
- $p(x) \sim U(0,a)$, which means $p(x) = \frac{1}{a}$ for $0 \leq x \leq a$, and $p(x) = 0$ otherwise.
- $\phi(x) = e^{-x}$ for $x > 0$, and $\phi(x) = 0$ for $x \leq 0$.

Now, let's calculate the average estimation for the given ranges:

1. For $x < 0$:
$\hat{p}(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(y) \phi(x-y) dy = 0$

Since $\phi(x-y) = 0$ for $x-y \leq 0$, and $p(y) = 0$ for $y < 0$, the convolution is zero in this range.

2. For $0 \leq x \leq a$:
$\hat{p}(x) = \int_{0}^{x} p(y) \phi(x-y) dy = \int_{0}^{x} \frac{1}{a} e^{-(x-y)} dy$

$\hat{p}(x) = \frac{1}{a} \int_{0}^{x} e^{-(x-y)} dy = \frac{1}{a} \left[-e^{-(x-y)}\right]_{0}^{x} = \frac{1}{a} (1 - e^{-x})$

3. For $a \leq x$:
$\hat{p}(x) = \int_{x-a}^{x} p(y) \phi(x-y) dy = \int_{x-a}^{x} \frac{1}{a} e^{-(x-y)} dy$

$\hat{p}(x) = \frac{1}{a} \int_{x-a}^{x} e^{-(x-y)} dy = \frac{1}{a} \left[-e^{-(x-y)}\right]_{x-a}^{x} = \frac{1}{a} (e^{-a} - e^{-x})$

In summary, the average estimation through the given Parzen window is:

- For $x < 0$: $\hat{p}(x) = 0$
- For $0 \leq x \leq a$: $\hat{p}(x) = \frac{1}{a} (1 - e^{-x})$
- For $a \leq x$: $\hat{p}(x) = \frac{1}{a} (e^{-a} - e^{-x})$

a linear regression with L2 regularization is like this:
$$\beta = \arg \max_{\beta} \sum_{i=1}^n{(Y_i-X_i\beta)^2} + \lambda ||\beta||_2^2$$
and $$\lambda\geq 0$$ is the L2 regularization parameter and $$X_i=\left[ X_i^{(1)},\dots,X_i^{(d)} \right]$$
. assuming $$Y=\left[ Y_1,\dots,Y_n \right]$$ and $$A=\left[ X_1,\dots,X_n \right]$$
find the closed form answer of $$\hat{\beta}$$

To find the closed-form solution for the L2-regularized linear regression, we need to solve the optimization problem:

$$\hat{\beta} = \arg \min_{\beta} \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i \beta)^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2$$

First, let's rewrite the objective function in matrix notation:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - X_i \beta)^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2 = \|Y - A\beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2$$

To find the minimum, we take the derivative of the objective function with respect to $\beta$ and set it to zero:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} (\|Y - A\beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|\beta\|_2^2) = 0$$

Expanding the derivative:

$$-2A^T(Y - A\beta) + 2\lambda \beta = 0$$

Rearranging the terms:

$$A^TA\beta - A^TY + \lambda \beta = 0$$
$$(A^TA + \lambda I)\beta = A^TY$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix.

Assuming $(A^TA + \lambda I)$ is invertible, we can multiply both sides by its inverse to solve for $\hat{\beta}$:

$$\hat{\beta} = (A^TA + \lambda I)^{-1}A^TY$$

This is the closed-form solution for the L2-regularized linear regression problem.

Sure, here is the integral form of the Parzen window in LaTeX format:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \left( 1 - \left( \frac{x}{h} \right)^2 \right)^{m} dx $$

where:

- f(x) is the function to be windowed
- h is the window parameter (bandwidth)
- m is the shape parameter, which controls the smoothness of the window (a higher m results in a smoother window)

find the bayesian decision rule

A nice problem in Bayesian decision theory!

To find the Bayesian decision rule, we need to compute the posterior probabilities of each class given the observation $x$, and then decide based on the maximum posterior probability.

Let's assume that the prior probabilities of each class are equal, i.e., $P(w_1) = P(w_2) = 1/2$. We want to find the Bayesian decision rule, which is a function that maps the observation $x$ to one of the two classes, $w_1$ or $w_2$.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write the posterior probabilities as:

$$P(w_1|x) = \frac{p(x|w_1)P(w_1)}{p(x)}$$
$$P(w_2|x) = \frac{p(x|w_2)P(w_2)}{p(x)}$$

where $p(x)$ is the probability density function of the observation $x$.

We are given the likelihood functions:

$$p(x|w_1) = \begin{cases} \frac{3}{2}, & 0 \leq x \leq \frac{2}{3} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
$$p(x|w_2) = \begin{cases} \frac{3}{2}, & \frac{1}{3} \leq x \leq 1 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Now, we can compute the posterior probabilities:

**Case 1: $0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{3}$**

In this case, $p(x|w_1) = \frac{3}{2}$ and $p(x|w_2) = 0$. Therefore:

$$P(w_1|x) = \frac{\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{p(x)}$$
$$P(w_2|x) = 0$$

Since $P(w_1|x) > P(w_2|x)$, we decide $w_1$.

**Case 2: $\frac{1}{3} \leq x \leq \frac{2}{3}$**

In this case, $p(x|w_1) = \frac{3}{2}$ and $p(x|w_2) = \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore:

$$P(w_1|x) = \frac{\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{p(x)}$$
$$P(w_2|x) = \frac{\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{p(x)}$$

Since $P(w_1|x) = P(w_2|x)$, we have a tie. In this case, we can decide based on the prior probabilities, which are equal. We can arbitrarily choose one of the classes, say $w_1$.

**Case 3: $\frac{2}{3} \leq x \leq 1$**

In this case, $p(x|w_1) = 0$ and $p(x|w_2) = \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore:

$$P(w_1|x) = 0$$
$$P(w_2|x) = \frac{\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{p(x)}$$

Since $P(w_2|x) > P(w_1|x)$, we decide $w_2$.

The Bayesian decision rule is therefore:

$$\delta(x) = \begin{cases} w_1, & 0 \leq x \leq \frac{2}{3} \\ w_2, & \frac{2}{3} < x \leq 1 \end{cases}$$

Note that the decision boundary is at $x = \frac{2}{3}$.

Another great question!

To find the error of this classifier, we need to compute the probability of misclassification, which is the probability of deciding $w_1$ when the true class is $w_2$ or deciding $w_2$ when the true class is $w_1$.

Let's denote the prior probabilities as $P(w_1) = \pi_1$ and $P(w_2) = \pi_2 = 1 - \pi_1$.

The probability of misclassification is given by:

$$P(error) = P(w_1)P(D_2|w_1) + P(w_2)P(D_1|w_2)$$

where $D_1$ is the decision region for class $w_1$ and $D_2$ is the decision region for class $w_2$.

From the Bayesian decision rule we derived earlier, we know that:

$$D_1 = \left[0, \frac{2}{3}\right] \quad \text{and} \quad D_2 = \left(\frac{2}{3}, 1\right]$$

Now, we need to compute the conditional probabilities:

$$P(D_2|w_1) = P\left(x > \frac{2}{3}|w_1\right) = \int_{2/3}^{1} p(x|w_1) dx = 0$$

since $p(x|w_1) = 0$ for $x > \frac{2}{3}$.

Similarly,

$$P(D_1|w_2) = P\left(x \leq \frac{2}{3}|w_2\right) = \int_{0}^{2/3} p(x|w_2) dx = \int_{1/3}^{2/3} \frac{3}{2} dx = \frac{1}{2}$$

Now, we can plug in the values:

$$P(error) = \pi_1 \cdot 0 + \pi_2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi_2}{2} = \frac{1 - \pi_1}{2}$$

So, the error of this classifier is:

$$P(error) = \frac{1 - \pi_1}{2}$$

This is the parametric solution for the error of the classifier, where $\pi_1$ is the prior probability of class $w_1$.

assume we pick a randon point from w1 and one from w2 and create a knn clssifier with k=1. also assume that we pick a test point from one of the classes. find the error $P_1(e)$ for this classifier

Another interesting question!

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We pick a random point from $w_1$ and one from $w_2$. Let's call these points $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively.
2. We create a KNN classifier with $k=1$, which means we'll only consider the nearest neighbor to the test point.
3. We pick a test point from one of the classes, say $w_1$. Let's call this point $x_t$.

Now, let's analyze the error of this classifier:

**Case 1: $x_t$ is from $w_1$**

* If $x_1$ is closer to $x_t$ than $x_2$, the KNN classifier will correctly classify $x_t$ as $w_1$.
* If $x_2$ is closer to $x_t$ than $x_1$, the KNN classifier will misclassify $x_t$ as $w_2$.

The probability of misclassification in this case is:

$$P_1(e) = P(x_2 \text{ is closer to } x_t \text{ than } x_1)$$

**Case 2: $x_t$ is from $w_2$**

* If $x_2$ is closer to $x_t$ than $x_1$, the KNN classifier will correctly classify $x_t$ as $w_2$.
* If $x_1$ is closer to $x_t$ than $x_2$, the KNN classifier will misclassify $x_t$ as $w_1$.

The probability of misclassification in this case is:

$$P_2(e) = P(x_1 \text{ is closer to } x_t \text{ than } x_2)$$

Since we're interested in the error $P_1(e)$, we'll focus on Case 1.

To compute $P_1(e)$, we need to find the probability that $x_2$ is closer to $x_t$ than $x_1$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that $x_2$ is to the left of the midpoint between $x_1$ and $x_t$.

Let's denote the midpoint as $m = \frac{x_1 + x_t}{2}$. Then, we can write:

$$P_1(e) = P(x_2 < m)$$

Using the probability density functions:

$$p(x|w_1) = \begin{cases} \frac{3}{2}, & 0 \leq x \leq \frac{2}{3} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
$$p(x|w_2) = \begin{cases} \frac{3}{2}, & \frac{1}{3} \leq x \leq 1 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

We can compute the probability:

$$P_1(e) = P(x_2 < m) = \int_{1/3}^{m} \frac{3}{2} dx = \frac{3}{2} \left(m - \frac{1}{3}\right)$$

Now, we need to find the distribution of $m$. Since $x_1$ and $x_t$ are both from $w_1$, we can assume they are independent and identically distributed. Then, the distribution of $m$ is:

$$p(m) = \int_{0}^{2/3} p(x_1) p(x_t) dx_1 dx_t = \int_{0}^{2/3} \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 dx_1 dx_t = \frac{9}{4} m^2$$

for $0 \leq m \leq \frac{2}{3}$.

Finally, we can compute the expected value of $P_1(e)$:

$$P_1(e) = \int_{0}^{2/3} \frac{3}{2} \left(m - \frac{1}{3}\right) \frac{9}{4} m^2 dm = \frac{9}{8} \int_{0}^{2/3} m^3 - \frac{1}{3} m^2 dm = \frac{1}{12}$$

So, the error $P_1(e)$ for this KNN classifier is:

$$P_1(e) = \frac{1}{12}$$

The Parzen window estimator, also known as the kernel density estimator, is a non-parametric method for estimating the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable from a sample of data points. The formula for the Parzen window estimator is given by:

$$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^{n} K\left(\frac{x - x_i}{h}\right)$$

where:

- $\hat{f}(x)$ is the estimated probability density function at point $x$
- $n$ is the number of data points in the sample
- $h$ is the bandwidth or smoothing parameter
- $K(\cdot)$ is the kernel function, which is a non-negative, symmetric, and integrable function that satisfies $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} K(u) du = 1$
- $x_i$ are the data points in the sample
