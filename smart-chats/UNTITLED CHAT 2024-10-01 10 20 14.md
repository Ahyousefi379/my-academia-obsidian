tell me about Au-Apt@ZIF-8

##### assistant
Based on your notes, Au-Apt@ZIF-8 refers to a specific type of metal-organic framework (MOF) that has been modified with gold (Au) and aptamer (Apt) for drug delivery applications.
ZIF-8 is a type of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) that is composed of zinc ions and imidazolate linkers. It is a highly porous material with a large surface area, making it suitable for drug loading and delivery.
The modification of ZIF-8 with gold (Au) and aptamer (Apt) is likely intended to enhance the targeting and delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells or tissues. Aptamers are short, single-stranded nucleic acids that can bind specifically to target molecules, such as proteins or cells. By conjugating aptamers to the surface of ZIF-8, it is possible to create a targeted drug delivery system that can selectively bind to and deliver therapeutic agents to specific cells or tissues.
The gold (Au) modification may also serve to enhance the photothermal properties of the MOF, allowing for combined photothermal and chemotherapy treatments. This is suggested by the title of one of the papers mentioned in your notes, "Gold-Aptamer-Modified Metal−Organic Framework Drug Delivery Nanosystems for Combined PhotothermalChemotherapy of Cancer".
Overall, Au-Apt@ZIF-8 appears to be a promising drug delivery system that combines the advantages of MOFs with the targeting capabilities of aptamers and the photothermal properties of gold.

summarize this note

##### assistant
Based on your notes, it appears that this is a blog post about the different ways to perform dot product and matrix multiplication in Python using NumPy. The post compares the following methods:

1. `multiply()`: element-wise multiplication
2. `dot()`: dot product (matrix multiplication)
3. `matmul()`: matrix multiplication (introduced in NumPy 1.10)
4. `@`: matrix multiplication operator (introduced in Python 3.5)

The post likely discusses the differences between these methods, including their syntax, performance, and use cases. However, without more information, it's difficult to provide a more detailed summary.
