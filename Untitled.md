**Bayesian Decision Theory**
==========================

**Introduction**
---------------

Bayesian decision theory is a mathematical framework for making decisions under uncertainty. It provides a structured approach to decision-making, taking into account the uncertainty associated with the outcomes of different actions. This framework is based on Bayesian statistics, which is a branch of statistics that deals with updating probabilities based on new information.

**Key Concepts**
----------------

### Decision Problem

A decision problem consists of a set of possible actions (or decisions) and a set of possible states of the world. The goal is to choose the action that maximizes the expected utility or payoff.

### Utility Function

A utility function is a mathematical representation of the preferences of a decision-maker. It assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome, reflecting the decision-maker's relative preference for that outcome.

### Probability Distribution

A probability distribution represents the uncertainty associated with the states of the world. In Bayesian decision theory, this distribution is updated based on new information using Bayes' theorem.

### Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is a fundamental concept in Bayesian statistics, which updates the probability distribution based on new information. It is given by:

$$P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}$$

where $P(H|E)$ is the posterior probability of hypothesis $H$ given evidence $E$, $P(E|H)$ is the likelihood of evidence $E$ given hypothesis $H$, $P(H)$ is the prior probability of hypothesis $H$, and $P(E)$ is the probability of evidence $E$.

### Expected Utility

The expected utility of an action is the weighted sum of the utilities of each possible outcome, where the weights are the probabilities of each outcome.

### Decision Rule

A decision rule is a function that maps the probability distribution and utility function to a recommended action. The most common decision rule is the maximum expected utility (MEU) rule, which recommends the action with the highest expected utility.

**Formulation of Bayesian Decision Theory**
------------------------------------------

### Decision Problem Formulation

A decision problem can be formulated as follows:

* Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of possible actions
* Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of possible states of the world
* Let $u(a, s)$ be the utility function, which assigns a numerical value to each possible outcome $(a, s)$
* Let $P(s)$ be the prior probability distribution over the states of the world
* Let $P(s|a)$ be the likelihood function, which represents the probability of each state given an action

### Bayesian Update

The probability distribution is updated based on new information using Bayes' theorem:

$$P(s|a, e) = \frac{P(e|a, s) \cdot P(s|a)}{P(e|a)}$$

where $e$ is the new evidence, and $P(e|a)$ is the probability of the evidence given the action.

### Expected Utility Calculation

The expected utility of each action is calculated as:

$$EU(a) = \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} u(a, s) \cdot P(s|a, e)$$

### Decision Rule

The MEU rule recommends the action with the highest expected utility:

$$a^* = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} EU(a)$$

**Advanced Topics**
-------------------

### Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic problem in Bayesian decision theory, where a decision-maker must choose one of multiple actions (or arms) to maximize the expected reward.

### Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)

A POMDP is a mathematical framework for decision-making under uncertainty, where the decision-maker has only partial information about the state of the world.

### Bayesian Robustness

Bayesian robustness is a concept that deals with the sensitivity of the decision to the prior distribution and the likelihood function.
