Email address: cristina.multari@polito.it Abstract During the last decades the applications of nanotechnology in the biomedical field have attracted a lot of attention. Magnetic and gold nanoparticles (MNPs and GNPs) became a new area of interest as selective tools for tumour treatment, due to their unique properties and biocompatibility. In this paper Superparamagnetic-Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (MNPs) decorated with Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been prepared by means of an innovative synthesis process using tannic acid as reducing agent. The as obtained nanoplatforms were characterized in terms of size, morphology, structure, composition, magnetic response and plasmonic properties. The results revealed that hybrid nanoplatforms (Magneto Plasmonic Nanoparticles, MPNPs) composed of a magnetic core and an external GNPs decoration acting in synergy have been developed. Biological test on both on healthy and cancer cells exposed to different nanoparticles concentration, upon laser irradiation, was also performed. GNPs grafted on MNPs surface revealed the ability to convert the received light into thermal energy, which was selective in its detrimental effect on cancer cells.

In recent years the application of these materials in the field of tumour therapy gained strongly interest 1–3. NPs have emerged as key players in modern medicine because of their different application ranging from drug delivery, tumour targeting, contrast agent in medical imaging to hyperthermia4. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are among the most studied NPs in the field of tumour therapy and delivery systems5–9 due to their ability of easily reach the tumour site under the guide of an external magnetic field 10,11. Moreover, the superparamagnetic behaviour of MNPs is of particular interest because they do not retain any magnetism when the magnetic field is removed 12–14. This property allows to guide MNPs directly in the tumour site and to heat them by using an external alternated magnetic field, as reported in literature 15,16. Additionally, MNPs have the ability to be used for cellular therapy such as cell labelling and targeting and for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) working as contrast agent 17–19. For these applications, MNPs must have combined properties of biocompatibility, reactive functions at the surface and high magnetic saturation 20,21. Other NPs deeply studied in recent years are gold nanoparticles (GNPs), which are known in the biomedical field for various application and their high biocompatibility22–24. One of their most important property is the capability to be used for photothermal therapy 4,25,26. In fact, GNPs, stimulated by a laser, can convert the received light into thermal energy, which is useful to destroy cancer cells as a consequence of their high heat sensitivity 27–29. By using GNPs and MNPs together, it is possible to obtain a hybrid nanoplatform, which combines both properties of these nanomaterials and can act as therapeutic and diagnostic Page 2 of 23AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - NANO-120006.R2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Accepted Manuscript agent. In literature, magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles are one of the emergent multifunctional materials with potential use in medicine 30–32. Several papers describe the study of nanoplatform composed by a magnetic core and a gold shell 33,34, their surface functionalization with different molecules and drugs 35,36. The purpose of the present work, is to prepare Magneto Plasmonic nanoparticles (MPNPs) through a facile synthesis in which Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are reduced directly on Superparamagnetic-Iron Oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) surface through to the innovative use of Tannic Acid as reducing agent. Tannic acid was selected first of all since it is an eco-friendly agent with reducing ability37 and for its natural antioxidant, antimicrobial and antitumoral properties38,39,40. Thanks to the combined action of GNPs and MNPs, acting in synergy, it is expected that, in vivo, these hybrid nanoplatforms will be able to be driven directly into the tumour site, thanks to an external magnetic guidance, and then irradiated with a laser light, which can activate the GNPs by converting the light into thermal energy. The irradiation of the MPNPs until they reach a temperature range between 43°C and 46°C will cause an important damage of the cancer cells, not being dangerous for the healthy ones 41,42. The synthetized MPNPs have been characterized through physical, magnetic and optical analysis, in order to evaluate their size, morphology, superparamagnetic behaviour and plasmonic properties. Moreover, different biological tests have been performed using both healthy and cancer buccal mucosa cells, several NPs concentrations and a green laser irradiation, to investigate the MPNPs ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells without affect the viability of healthy ones. 2 Experimental Section MPNPs were prepared by adapting a synthesis route reported in our previous paper43. Briefly, MPNPs were synthetized by co-precipitation of Fe3O4 NPs followed by their surface Page 3 of 23 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - NANO-120006.R2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Accepted Manuscript decoration with Au NPs seeded and nucleated on their surface. In the present paper the decoration with Au was obtained by reduction with Tannic Acid, an organic chemical. This polyphenolic compound has the great advantage of being useful both as reducing and stabilizing agent; moreover, it exhibits antioxidant properties44. The synthesis route could be synthetized by the following steps: -Synthesis of Fe3O4 NPs by co-precipitation from FeCl2 and FeCl3 aqueous solutions -Citric Acid stabilization, to prevent the MNPs aggregation. The stabilization was performed by adding 60ml of 0.05 M Citric Acid to the Fe3O4 solution, the suspension was then heated at 80 °C and stirred for 90 minutes to promote the absorption of Citric Acid on the MNPs surface. -APTES (Aminopropyltriethoxysilane) functionalization, to introduce a -NH2 group on MNPs surface. This issue was achieved by adding 100 l of APTES to the suspension and then stirred for 3 h at 80 °C. Finally, the APTES-coated MNPs solution was adjusted to pH=5 in order to induce a positive charge on the surface. -Tannic acid and HAuCl4 additions to the MNPs solution to create the MPNPs. This step was performed by adding 4 ml of HAuCL4 (12.7mM) and 0.4 ml of Tannic Acid (1.25 mM) to 1.3 ml of MNPs solution. After 5 minutes of stirring at 70 °C, the magneto-plasmonic complexes were magnetically separated; thus only Au NPs attached to the citric acid/APTES-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles have been collected. -MPNPs were re-dispersed in water and the solution was ready. The obtained nanoparticles were then characterized in terms of shape, morphology and biological properties.

In particular, the dimensions and morphology on MPNPs were studied using electron microscopes FESEM (Zeiss supra 40 GEMINI Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy) and - TEM (FEI Tecnai F20 TWIN transmission electron microscope with a Schottky emitter operated at 200 KV); structure and composition of MPNPs were detected by Zeiss supra 40 GEMINI X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and JASCO 4000 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) which acquired spectra from 4000 to 450 cm-1; optical properties of GNPs were measured by UV-Visible spectrophotometry, UV-2600 Shimadzu (UV-VIS), the spectra was collected monitoring the absorbance of the solution by using DI water as reference at the desired wavelength; DC magnetic properties were investigated by means of a DC magnetometer (LakeShore 7225) equipped with a Cryogen-Free Magnet system at room temperature in quasi-static condition. To achieve FESEM, TEM and EDS investigation, a drop of the sample solution was placed on a Cu grid, 150 mesh, coated with ultrathin amorphous carbon film, then the grid was located on the appropriate support for the analysis. To perform FT-IR and Hysteresis loop, MNPs were dried at room temperature for 24 h. For UV-VIS analysis, the MPNPs were maintained in the original solution. 2.2 Cytotoxicity Assessment Toxicity tests were performed in order to establish the MPNPs concentration that could not damage the healthy cells, but could destroy the cancers one when irradiated with a green laser source. For these analyses a 530 nm continuous wave laser light (Output: +12V, 3A), Page 5 of 23 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - NANO-120006.R2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Accepted Manuscript irradiance of 60 mW/cm2 was used to irradiate each sample for 5 minutes. The temperature to be reached under laser exposure is between 43°C and 46°C 41,42, in this manner it is possible to induce apoptosis in cancer cells without having any effect on the healthy ones. For this purpose, the temperature was measured at the end of irradiation with an infrared thermometer. The irradiation was applied to the samples (starting from their initial temperature of 37°C) and maintained for five minutes: during this irradiation time the temperature reached is between 43°C and 44°C. The cells used to perform the tests were:  Healthy cell line: Human Gingivalis Fibroblast (HGF), obtained from DS pharma biomedical.  Cancer cell line: Squamous Carcinoma, Buccal Mucosa (HO-1-N-1), obtained from JCRB. Both cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) supplemented with 10% of FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and seeded in different well plate (MatTek Corporation). 2.2.1 Fluorescence Microscope (FM) To perform FM, HGF and HO-1-N1 cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 2*104 cells in 200 μl of cells medium. After 48 hours MPNPs were dispersed in cell culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 5, 25 and 50 μg/ml and were added to the cells cultures in a final volume of 200 μl for each well. 4 hours later the photo-thermal treatment was performed applying the irradiation for 5 minutes. Then FM was performed with FM JuLI Stage, AR Brown CO. Cells were stained with: Hoechst 33342® (nuclei, in blue); Annexin (early apoptosis without breaking membrane, in green); PI (cell death with breaking membrane, in red). 2.2.2 WST-Assay Page 6 of 23AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - NANO-120006.R2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Accepted Manuscript HGF and HO-1-N-1 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 5*104 cells/well. After 48 hours MPNPs were dispersed in cell culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 5 and 50 μg/ml and were added to the cells cultures in a final volume of 2 ml for each well. 4 hours later some wells were exposed to a laser irradiation for 5 minutes. The viability of all cell cultures was determined after 4 hours from laser exposure using a standard WST-8 assay (WST-assay-Kit is Dojindo, Cytotoxicity LDH Assay Kit-WST, Lot.KP 870). 2.2.3 Raman Spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy was performed on both HGF and HO-1-N1. The cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 5*104 cells in 2 ml of cells medium. After 48 hours MPNPs were dispersed in cell culture medium to obtain a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and were added to the cells cultures. 4 hours later the photo-thermal treatment was performed applying 530 nm of laser irradiation. Then the Raman spectra were detected 4 hours later with ARAMIS, LabRAM HR800 (Horiba/Jobin Ibon, Kyoto, Japan). • Laser option: 532 nm, Green Laser; • Acquisition time: 10 second; • Acquisition number: 4; • Number of spectra acquired: 5 spectra for each sample 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterization tests MPNPs were characterized in terms of size and morphology by means of TEM, FESEM and EDS analyses. In figure 1 are shown FESEM and EDS analyses, in which is possible to attest the reduction of GNPs on MNPs surface, as reported by the spectrum analysis which revealed the presence of gold in a high weight percentage (77.88 %).

In figure 2b is possible to see the approximately spherical shape of MPNPs, and the dimensional range that results to be between 5-20 nm. From figures 2c-g instead is possible to attest the presence of GNPs which creates a sort of nano-dumbbell with the MNPs. In particular, figure 2c evidenced the dense layer of APTES surrounding magnetic NPs and embedding the GNPs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, reported in figure 2d, displays several diffraction rings corresponding to Fe3O4, together with diffraction features from Au. Through the HAADF/STEM-EDS analysis, shown in figure 2e-g, it is possible to confirm the presence of GNPs, with average size of 10 nm, and MNPs components.

In (c) magnified image of the MPNPs and in (d) an overview SAED pattern of the sample is shown, with the blue and green features indicating diffraction rings ascribable to metallic Au (ICSD 44362) and Fe3O4 (ICSD 26410), respectively. (e) HAADF-STEM image of MPNPs shows a difference in contrast due to the different mean atomic number of GNPs and MNPs, confirmed by STEM-EDS mapping of Au (f) and Fe (g) mapping over the selected area in figure (e). Figure 3 shows the spectra obtained from FT-IR analysis. In particular, it is possible to observe the peaks attesting the magnetite formation and the stabilization with citric acid. At 585 cm-1 the peak associated to the Fe-O bond is evidenced. At 1400 cm-1 the peak related to the asymmetric stretching of COO- group of COOH of citric acid and around 1600 cm-1 the peak ascribable to the vibration of C-O of COOH group of citric acid can be noticed.

Peak attesting Fe-O bond at 585 cm-1; asymmetric stretching of COO- group of COOH of citric acid at 1400 cm-1; the vibration of C-O of COOH group of citric acid at 1600 cm-1. The hysteresis loop is performed in order to attest the superparamagnetic performance of MPNPs, this is essential to have information on their magnetic response. MPNPs exhibit the superparamagnetic behaviour as confirmed by the magnetization vs. applied magnetic field characterizations obtained at room temperature. In particular, MPNPs show no hysteresis (figure 4): the coercive field and remanence magnetization are negligible at room temperature, above the blocking temperature for this material45. The absence of hysteresis is characteristic of superparamagnetic behaviour and confirms the nanometric size of the MPNPs46.

The magnetic measurement shows no coercivity and remanence at room temperature, suggesting its superparamagnetic behaviour. As regards the optical characterization, the UV-Vis analysis was performed in order to identify the plasmonic peak of GNPs, which is useful to understand at which wavelength our nanoparticles are able to absorb light and can confirm the GNPs dimension measured from TEM48. In figure 5 the plasmonic peak at 560 nm is presented. This information allows to identify the correct wavelength to be used in the cytotoxicity test by using a laser irradiation light with an emission wavelength around the obtained value.

The figure shows the absorption spectra of GNPs at 560 nm. 2.2 Biological tests The biological tests were performed through 3 different analyses. The first one is achieved by using the fluorescence microscope in which the resulting images give information about the cellular status. In fact, thanks to the different staining used, is possible to understand if cells are damaged or not. Three different concentrations of MPNPs (5, 25 and 50 μg/ml) were tested both on HGF and HO-1-N-1 cells, in order to evaluate the difference between them in terms of viability. In figure 6, the images in which cells are exposed to the different MPNPs concentration and then irradiated for five minutes with a laser light are reported. The control without any nanoparticles exposure is shown as well. It is easy to notice that any important damage occurs when cells are treated with 5 and 25 μg/ml, both HGF and HO-1-N-1 cells and both when laser irradiation is applied or not. On the contrary, when a 50 μg/ml of NPs concentration is used, it is possible to see that only HO-1-N-1 cells go in apoptosis. This happens only when the laser irradiation is applied, while is clear that the same MNNPs concentration is not giving any detrimental effect if the sample is not irradiated.

The test shows the difference between cells exposed to MPNPs and irradiated for 5 minutes and the cells exposed to MPNPs without irradiation. Staining used: red: PI; blue: Hoechst; green: Annexin. Scale bar: 250 μm The second analysis performed is the WST assay, which indicates the number of viable cells that can be quantified by measuring the absorbance given from their metabolic activity. For this test only the MPNPs concentration of 5 and 50 μg/ml were tested. In figure 7.b, WST assay on HO-1-N1 cells shows an important decrease of intensity by raising the concentrations of MPNPs, mostly when the cells are exposed to five minutes’ laser Page 13 of 23 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - NANO-120006.R2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Accepted Manuscript irradiation (in red), which means that cells viability is negatively affected by the contact with MPNPs which is a clearly amplified by laser irradiation. On the contrary, figure 7.a, related to HGF cells, shows only a slight decrease in cell viability for MPNPs concentration up to 50 μg/ml, both when they are irradiated or not. This result is relevant for the hypothesis that a synergistic effect of MPNPs and irradiation can be selective on tumour cells, while preserving healthy cell viability. Figure 7: WST assay of HGF cells (left) and HO-1-N1 (right) exposed to 0, 5 and 50 μg/ml of MPNPs. The red columns are related to the samples irradiated with 5 minutes’ laser light. p-values (Student's t-test) indicated above bars; NS: non-significant; *: significant for p<0.05. In figure 8 the Raman spectra registered on HO-1-N-1 cell line is reported. For this test the concentration of 50 μg/ml was used, since the WST assay and fluorescence microscope indicated that at this concentration the best performance has been achieved. The graph reports the spectra acquired from cells not exposed to laser irradiation in green; while in red the spectra acquired when five minutes of continuous laser irradiation applied is shown. In a Raman shift, when the laser beam hits a cell, chemicals within the cell can absorb and reflect or scatter the light waves. This scattering generates a marker at various wavelengths that can Page 14 of 23AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - NANO-120006.R2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Accepted Manuscript be used to identify specific molecules, which depends on the molecule type and the chemical bonds present within its structure47. The major difference among the four spectra is that Phenylalanine (peak at 1002 cm-1), an important indicator of cellular vitality48, is really high in the cells not exposed to laser (with a slight decrease in case of exposition to MPNPs, as already observed in the WST assay) and become lower when laser irradiation is applied, both with and without exposition to MPNPs. This test reveals that irradiation could cause metabolic alterations to HO-1-N1 cells but the synergistic effect of MPNPs and irradiation is more difficult to be evidenced with this test. Other information regarding the alteration of cellular condition are given from the peaks at 1031 cm-1 and 1601 cm-1 (again referred to Phenylalanine) which decreases with the laser irradiation. These results are consistent with the results coming from the fluorescence microscope and the WST assay, in fact both analyses confirm that when cells are exposed to a concentration of 50 μg/ml of MPNPs and irradiated with laser light, HO-1-N1 cells go in apoptosis and have metabolic alteration.

In green the spectra related to the HO-1-N1 cells (control) and the HO-1-N1 cells exposed to 50 μg/ml of MPNPs; in red HO- 1-N1 cells (Control + L) and the HO-1-N1 cells exposed to 50 μg/ml of MPNPs both exposed to 5 minutes of laser irradiation. Conclusions In this paper, a facile and reproducible synthesis was used to develop new hybrid nanoplatforms (Magneto Plasmonic Nanoparticles, MPNPs) composed of a magnetic core and an external GNPs decoration, able to maintain the peculiar properties of both nanomaterials. The novelty of this work is the synergy and the combined effect of MNPs and GNPs that comes from the described synthesis method, by means of the innovative use of Tannic Acid. In fact, the combination of MNPs and GNPs allows to maintain the possibility of driving the MPNPs exactly in a specific tumour site by using an external magnetic field, due to their superparamagnetic response, and allows to produce heating by converting the light received from laser irradiation into thermal energy due to the GNPs decoration (attached on the magnetic ones). Thus, these hybrid nanoplatforms have the great potentiality to be used for photothermal therapy of cancer. The morphological characterization revealed that the shape and the dimension of MPNPs are suitable for the biomedical application, the magnetic characterization attested their superparamagnetic behaviour and the UV-VIS analysis revealed the plasmonic peak of gold at 560 nm. The biological test performed on both healthy (HGF) and cancer (HO-1-N-1) cells gave information on the best MPNPs concentration useful to bring HO-1-N-1 cells to apoptosis without having bad effect on HGF cells, which results to be at 50 μg/ml. Upon laser irradiation, any detrimental effect on HGF cells has been evidenced, while the tumoral ones went in apoptosis. In view of in vivo applications, owing to the magnetic core of the MPNPs, a Page 16 of 23AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - NANO-120006.R2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60Accepted Manuscript further reduction of side effects on healthy cells could be achieved by localizing MPNPs directly on tumour site with the help of external magnetic field.
