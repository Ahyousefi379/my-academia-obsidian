Hydrogel has been widely used in skin wound healing own to it is able to mimic the 3D microenvironment of cells, which supports cell proliferation, migration and secretion. In this study, we created a novel biocompatible thermo-sensitive hydrogel to carry BMSCs for full-thickness skin wound healing. The thermo-sensitive hydrogel loaded with BMSCs can fast achieve sol-gel transition after im- planting to the wound. Histological results conﬁrmed that hydrogel-BMSCs combination group showed sig- niﬁcant promotion of wound closure, epithelial cells' proliferation and re-epithelialization, and reduced in- ﬂammatory responses in the wounds and in the tissues surrounding the wounds. The combination therapy also can promote collagen deposition, TGF-β1 and bFGF secretion and tissue remodeling. The present study provides a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of skin wounds. 1. Introduction Skin is the largest organ of the human body and is the ﬁrst barrier to the external environment. Skin wound healing is a common problem and a major challenge for large-area trauma, burn and no healing diabetic skin wound [1]. In recent years, the eﬀects of stem cell transplantation on skin wound healing have been extensively studied [2,3]. Researchers have proven that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have a positive eﬀect on promoting wound healing. The cur- rent researches showed that BMSCs used as seed cells for transplanta- tion, it can secrete various types of cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF), which can promote the formation of granulation tissue in wounds, assist in the regeneration of skin appendages after epithelization [4–6]. BMSCs can also diﬀerentiate into vascular en- dothelial cells, epidermal cells and other skin appendage structures to participate in wound repair [7–11]. Absorbent cotton medical gauze is primarily used as a conventional dressing for clinical applications. Despite its wide use, gauze has a number of disadvantages. For example, its absorbency is not suﬃciently high, it needs to be frequently changed, it is prone to adhere to wounds, and it can lead to secondary trauma. Biological dressings mainly in- clude freeze-dried pork skin and amniotic membranes, although they have signiﬁcant advantages over conventional absorbent cotton med- ical gauze, biological dressings still have insurmountable dis- advantages, including their limited application, the risk of spreading bacterial, fungal and viral diseases, and the possibility of im- munological rejection [12–15]. As an alternative, thermo-sensitive hydrogels can prevent the loss of water and body ﬂuid from wounds, additionally, thermo-sensitive hy- drogels can not only adhere to irregularly surfaced wounds but can also resist the invasion of bacteria. Due to their good water-absorption ca- pacity and degradability, thermo-sensitive hydrogels can avoid sec- ondary trauma during the dressing change [16–19]. Furthermore, thermo-sensitive hydrogels provide a temporary support substratum for cell transplantation, as the porous internal structure of thermo-sensitive hydrogels provides a suitable space for cell proliferation and diﬀer- entiation and for nutrient exchange [20–23]. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2018.04.045 Received 30 November 2017; Received in revised form 30 March 2018; Accepted 16 April 2018 ⁎ Correspondence to: Z.

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Boster), keratin 1 (K1) (Abcam) and keratin 6 (K6) (Covance). CCK-8 proliferation assay kit was purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc. DMEM medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS). glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin were ordered from Invitrogen. Cell culture plate was ordered from Corning. The basic-FGF and TGF-β1 ELISA kit were purchased from Shanghai Licheng Biological Technology co., LTD, China. 2.2. Synthesis of hyperbranched PAA crosslinker MBA (234 mg, 1.52 mmol), Agmatine (138 mg, 0.6 mmol) and AEPZ (52 mg, 0.4 mmol) were dissolved in water/methanol (v/v = 5/1, total in 5 ml) while stirring. When the solution was clear, LiOH·H2O (25.2 mg, 0.6 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was then gently stirred and allowed to react at 40 °C in the dark for 72 h. After the reaction, the solvent was evaporated using a rotary-evaporator. The product was ﬁnally recovered by lyophilization and stored in-20 °C refrigerator for future use. 2.3. Characterization of hyperbranched PAA crosslinker The hyperbranched PAA crosslinker was characterized by fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 1H NMR, the detailed in- formation as following. FTIR spectra were recorded with a Thermo Scientiﬁc IR100 FT-IR Spectrometer. PAA crosslinkers were freeze- dried in order to remove the residual chemicals. Then dried PAA crosslinkers were ground to powder, mixed with KBr, and compressed into pellets, then FTIR spectra were performed. In order to further characterize the hyperbranched PAA crosslinker, 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 1B) was recorded on an Advance 300 MHz spectrometer (Bruker). 8 mg of PAA crosslinker powders were dissolved in 800 μl of D2O. 1H NMR (ppm): δ, 1.5 (-N-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH-,s, 4 mH), 2.0–3.0(CO- CH2-CH2-N,m, 8(m + 2)H, -N2C4H8-CH2-CH2-N-,m, 8nH), 3.17(-N- CH2-CH2-,s, 2 mH), 4.53 and 4.62(-NH-CH2-CH-,s, 2 m + 2H), 5.77 (CH2 = CH-,t, 2H), 6.21(CH2 = CH-,s, 2H), 6.225 (-CH2 = CH,s, 2H). 2.4. Fabrication of thermo-sensitive hydrogel with hyperbranched PAA crosslinker PAA crosslinked poly-NIPAM hydrogels were prepared at the con- centration of 60 mg/ml with the ratio NIPAM: PAA = 5:1. Gels were fabricated in distill water by initiator APS (5.7 mg/ml) and catalyst TEMED (2.9 mg/ml) at room temperature for 30 min. 2.5. Characterization of physical properties 2.5.1. Swelling behavior test The hydrogel was fabricated into a 2-mm-thick cylinder with a diameter of 10 mm and was then freeze-dried. The dry weight of this cylinder, W0, was then measured. The dried cylinder was then placed in phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) (0.01 M; pH 7.4) at 37 °C and allowed to swell for 1.5 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h or 24 h. The wet weight of the cylinder, Wt, was measured at each time point. The swelling ratios were calculated using equation (Eq.) [1]. For this test, n = 6, and the mea- surement was repeated 3 times [24]. =− ×Swelling ratio (%) (Wt Wo)/Wo 100% (1) 2.5.2. In vitro degradation performance test The hydrogel was fabricated into a 2-mm-thick cylinder with a diameter of 10 mm. After it was freeze-dried, the hydrogel cylinder was evenly divided into 4 parts. The dry weight of each of the 4 parts, Wd, was measured. Each of the 4 parts was then separately immersed into PBS (0.01 M; pH 7.4) containing 1 mol/ml DTT at 37 °C. The 4 parts were then harvested, one each on the 8, 16, 24 and 32 days. The re- mainder of each harvested part was ﬁrst rinsed 3 times with distilled water at 37 °C and was then freeze-dried, after which the weight of the remaining part of hydrogel cylinder, Ww, was determined. The de- gradation rates were calculated using Eq. (2) [25]. For this test, n =6, and the measurement was repeated 3 times. =− ×Degradation rate (%) (Wd Ww)/Wd 100% (2) 2.5.3. Hydrogel toxicity analysis In accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10993-5, extracts were prepared using 1 ml of Dulbecco's mod- iﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for every 0.75 cm2 of hydrogel. The hydrogel was laid ﬂat in a 6-cm petri dish and UV sterilized for 30 min. DMEM was then added to the proportions described above, and the hydrogel was placed in a 37 °C incubator for 5 days for extraction. The hydrogels and extracts were then collected into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and ﬁlter sterilized as 100% hydrogel ex- tracts. DMEM was used to dilute the 100% extracts to prepare 50% extracts. The toxicity of the hydrogel was evaluated using the CCK-8 proliferation assay kit [26]. First, one hundred milliliter L929 ﬁbro- blasts suspension (5 × 103 cells) were seeded in each well of 96-well plate and cultured for 24 h, after which the culture medium was re- moved. The 50% and 100% hydrogel extraction media were then added to the wells respectively. After the ﬁbroblasts were cultured in diﬀerent conditioned media for 1 day, 2 days or 3 days, 10 μL of CCK-8 was added into each well, and the ﬁbroblasts were further incubated for 3 h. The absorption values at 450 nm were determined using an enzyme mark instrument (BIO-RAD). The relative proliferation rates were cal- culated using Eq. (3). There were 6 replicate wells in each group, and each measurement was repeated 3 times. = × Relative proliferation rate (%) (the sample)/(the negative control) 100% (3) 2.6. Culture and encapsulation of BMSCs One healthy 8- to 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Centre of Southern Medical University. Brieﬂy, bone marrow was obtained as in our previous study and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was re-suspended in DMEM medium plus with 10% FBS. 1% glutamine and 1%penicillin-streptomycin, transferred into a petri dish, and cultured in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The medium was replaced every 2 days, as the cells were subcultured once cell fusion reached 90% [27]. Fourth-generation BMSCs were trypsinized in 0.25% trypsin and centrifuged. Afterwards, the BMSCs were resuspended in saline and counted (cell concentration: 1 × 106 cells/ml). The BMSCs were again centrifuged, and 100 μl hydrogel was added to the centrifuged BMSCs. The hydrogel and the BMSCs were mixed to homogeneity using a pip- ette tip [28]. Z. Lei et al. Materials Science & Engineering C 90 (2018) 159–167 160 Fig. 1.

Materials Science & Engineering C 90 (2018) 159–167 161 2.7. Wound model Twenty-four healthy adult speciﬁc-pathogen-free (SPF)-class C57 mice were randomized into 4 groups: a control group, a BMSCs-alone group, a hydrogel-alone group and a hydrogel-BMSCs combination group. The mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (0.003 ml/g). After the hairs on one side of the back of each C57 mouse were shaved, the remaining hairs were removed using frozen honey wax. Next, a square-shaped (1-cm2) incision that was deep enough to penetrate the subcutaneous tissue was created [29]. After the operation, the mice had free access to food and water. The healing of the wounds on each mouse was recorded using a digital camera on the day of the operation and again on the 3, 5, 7 and 14 days after the operation. The wound-healing rates were calculated using the following equation: wound-healing rate = (the area of the original wound – the area of the unhealed wound) / the area of the original wound × 100%. The Bioethics Committee of Southern Medical Uni- versity approved all animal experiments, which were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 2.8. Histological observations After 3, 5, 7, 14 days treatment, the wound and surrounding tissue (0.5 cm) were carefully excised, rinsed in PBS, and then ﬁxed in 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA). Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (70–100%) and embedded in paraﬃn. Five-micrometer sections were prepared. According to the standard procedures, samples were stained with either hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or masson trichrome, and immunohistochemistry including F4/80 (eBioscience), bromo- deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (Boster), keratin 1 (K1) (Abcam) and keratin 6 (K6) (Covance). Image-Pro Plus was used to analyze the average optical density values for K1, K6, α -SMA expression. Five randomly selected ﬁelds of view were examined for each group at each time point and used to assess the average optical density value per unit area. Statistics re- garding the number of positively stained cells for BrdU were obtained using ﬁve randomly selected ﬁelds of view for each group at each time point. 2.9. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) A piece of skin located 0.5 cm from the wound of each mouse was excised on the 3, 5, 7 and 14 days after the operation. The skin was rinsed with saline and weighed. Next, the skin was homogenized at 4 °C with an amount of saline equal to 10 times the weight of the skin. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min, and the su- pernatants were stored in liquid nitrogen. An appropriate plate was taken from the ELISA kit, and blank wells, standard wells and sample wells for the assay were set. Horseradish peroxidase was added to the standard wells and the sample wells, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After the plate was washed, 50 μL of substrate A and 50 μL of substrate B were added to all of the wells, and the plate was then incubated for 15 min before a terminating reagent was added. The OD of each well was measured at 450 nm [30]. 2.10. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 13.0 software (IBM). All the data are expressed in the form of mean value ± standard deviation. Diﬀerences among the groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant (signiﬁcance levels: *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01). 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

Z. Lei et al. Materials Science & Engineering C 90 (2018) 159–167 162 (amidoamine) (PAA) crosslinker was synthesized via Michael-addition polymerization as shown in Fig. 1A. Fig. S1 showed the FTIR spectra of hyperbranched crosslinker, the sharp peaks appeared around 1650.66 cm-1 was attributed to the C]O stretching frequency from MBA. While peaks located at 1533.51 cm-1 was attributed to the NH2 group from agmatine and AEPZ, the results show successful conjugation of hyperbranched PAA crosslinker. In order to further determine the chemical structure of hyperbranched PAA crosslinker, we sued 1H NMR to conﬁrm it. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 1H NMR results further veriﬁed the PAA crosslinker structure was the same as desired. 3.2. Synthesis and characterization of the thermo-sensitive hydrogel The NIPAM and PAA were fabricated via radical polymerization due to the vinyl groups from the PAA crosslinker [31,32]. As shown in Fig. S2, the hydrogel was transparent and soft, more like liquid at room temperature, when it was heated to 37 oC, the hydrogel became white and solid. It suggested that the hydrogel is thermo-sensitive. Following we explored the swelling behavior and degradation behavior of the hydrogel. The swelling behavior of hydrogel was tested to evaluate the maximum liquid-absorption capacity. As shown in Fig. 2A, the swelling ratio of the hydrogel approached its maximal value at 12 h, the value is (3.9 ± 0.16)%. The degradation behavior of hydrogel in DTT solution, because the DTT solution can mimic the residual environment of the human body. As shown in Fig. 2B, The hydrogel can be gradually de- graded, it is biodegradable (Fig. 2B). Fig. 3C showed the relative pro- liferation rates of L929 cells in media extracted from the hydrogel. According to the ISO 10993-5 standard, the 50% and 100% extraction media of the hydrogel had a Class 1 toxicity level, whereas the positive control group showed a Class 4 toxicity level. These results show that the thermo-sensitive hydrogel exhibited a relatively high level of bio- logical safety, it mainly own to the induction of agmatine, which is similar to the RGD peptides that modiﬁed the PNIPAM hydrogel to enhance cell adhesion and proliferation [33]. 3.3. Hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promotes wound closure After wound occurred, the primary task is let the wound quickly close [34]. So we observed the post-operational wound-healing times and statistically analyzed the wound closure rates with diﬀerent treat- ments. We found that ﬁve and seven days after transplantation, the wound-healing rates of hydrogel-BMSCs combination group were sig- niﬁcantly higher than those of the mice in the hydrogel-alone group (p < 0.01), the BMSCs group or the control group (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the wounds of the mice in the hydrogel- BMSCs combination group closed earlier than those of the mice in the hydrogel-alone group, the BMSCs group or the control group. The his- tological results showed the re-epithelialization of the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group were higher than those of the mice in the hydrogel- alone group, the BMSCs group or the control group on the 3, 5 and 7 days respectively (Fig. 3C). These results show that the combination of hydrogel with BMSCs could promote wound closure. 3.4. Hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promote myoﬁbroblasts formation The wound contraction force is derived from myoﬁbroblast, which highly expresses α-SMA [35]. So we used immunohistochemistry Fig. 3. Hydrogel combined with BMSCs promoted wound healing.

Z. Lei et al. Materials Science & Engineering C 90 (2018) 159–167 163 technology to detect the expression of α-SMA in the four groups. As shown in Fig. 4, three and ﬁve days after the trauma, the expression of α-SMA in the wounds of the mice in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group was signiﬁcantly higher than the other three groups (p < 0.01). This result could clearly explain that the wound closure rate was the fastest in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group. 3.5. Hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promote skin cells proliferation Keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts are the two major cells of the skin after wound occurred, keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts proliferate ﬁrst, then migrate to the wound area [36]. Hence we used BrdU and Keratin 6 to detect the proliferation of ﬁbroblast and keratinocytes respectively. As shown in Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B, the BrdU positive cells in the hydrogel- BMSCs combination group were signiﬁcantly higher than the other three groups (p < 0.01) at each detected time point. When the kera- tinocytes proliferate, they strongly express K6. As shown in Fig. 5C and Fig. 5D, the expression of K6 in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group was also evidently higher than the other three groups (p < 0.01). These results revealed that hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy pro- motes ﬁbroblast proliferation in dermis and keratinocytes proliferation in the epidermis, which lay the foundation for wound tissue regenera- tion.

Hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promote collagen deposition We have demonstrated that hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promote ﬁbroblast proliferation in dermis, meanwhile, the proliferated ﬁbroblast will start to secrete ECM, and collagen is the major ECM [37]. Collagen deposition plays an important role in the wound repair pro- cess, it can provide a structural support for cell proliferation, migration, and diﬀerentiation [38]. As shown in Fig. 6, ﬁve days and 7 days after trauma, the amounts of newly formed collagen in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group were more than the other three groups. And there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the hydrogel-alone group and the BMSCs group in the amount of newly formed collagen. These results suggested the hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy was able to pro- mote collagen deposition. 3.7. Hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promote FGF and TGF-β1 secretion Extensive researches have shown that growth factors play important roles during the skin wound healing process, they can regulate cell proliferation, diﬀerentiation, migration, and secretion [39,40]. For example, TGF-β1 can stimulate ﬁbroblasts to synthesize large amounts of type I, type II, type III and type IV collagen, which provide a tem- porary ECM for the ingrowth of capillaries and the migration of basal cells [41]. In addition, TGF-β1 can promote ﬁbroblasts to transform into myoﬁbroblasts, which can highly express α-SMA and make wound contraction [42,43]. Another key growth factor in the wound healing is basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF). bFGF not only can promote wound healing but also can help tissue remodeling after wound closure, it is related to the downregulating type-I procollagen gene expression, which counteracts the excessive deposition of collagen by keloid ﬁ- broblasts and prevents keloid formation [44,45]. Hence, the expression levels of TGF-β1 and bFGF were analyzed using ELISA. As shown in Fig. 7A, the levels of TGF-β1 in the wound tissues showed an increasing trend 3 and 5 days after the operation, while they started decreasing on the 7 days after the operation. After trauma, the levels of TGF-β1 in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group were signiﬁcantly higher than the other three groups on both 3 days and 5 days (p < 0.01). Seven days after trauma, the levels of TGF-β1in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group, the hydrogel-alone group, and the BMSCs group had decreased to some extent, whereas the levels of TGF-β1 in the control group still exhibited an increasing trend. Ad- ditionally, the levels of TGF-β1 in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group were lower than in the hydrogel-alone group (p < 0.01) or the BMSCs group (p < 0.01), there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the TGF-β1 levels of the BMSCs group and the hydrogel-alone group (p > 0.05). As shown in Fig. 7B, the levels of bFGF in all groups exhibited an Fig. 6. The hydrogel-BMSCs combination promotes the synthesis of collagen in wounds. The synthesis and deposition of newly formed collagen in the wounds of the control group, the hydrogel group, the BMSCs group and the hydrogel- BMSCs combination group 5 and 7 days after the operation were examined using Masson's trichrome staining method.

Z. Lei et al. Materials Science & Engineering C 90 (2018) 159–167 165 increasing trend in the ﬁrst ﬁve days after trauma. Seven days after trauma, the levels of bFGF in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group, the hydrogel-alone group, and the BMSCs group exhibited a decreasing trend. After trauma, the levels of bFGF in the hydrogel-BMSCs combi- nation group were signiﬁcantly higher than the other three groups on both 3 days and 5 days (p < 0.01). And there was no signiﬁcant dif- ference between the bFGF levels of the hydrogel-alone group and the BMSCs group (p > 0.05). In addition to the control group, the levels of bFGF in the other 3 groups exhibited a decreasing trend on the 7 days. The levels of bFGF in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group were signiﬁcantly lower than the hydrogel-alone group (p < 0.01) and control group (p < 0.01). And there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence be- tween the levels of bFGF in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group and the BMSCs group (p > 0.05). 3.8. Hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promote tissue remodeling after wound healing After wound healing, the ECM needs to remodel, the exceed ECM will degrade until new formed ECM structure close to the normal tissue [31]. As shown in Fig. 8A, the masson staining also showed that the regenerated dermal tissue in the wounds of the mice in the hydrogel- BMSCs combination group was similar to the normal tissue, while the regenerated dermal tissue of other 3 groups were relatively dense, which suggested the tissue remodeling was not ﬁnished. Moreover, we also explored the epidermis maturation among the four groups. K1 is one of the markers for keratinocyte terminal diﬀerentiation. As shown in Fig. 8B and Fig. 8C, the expression of K1 in the control group lower than the other three groups (p > 0.01). There was no signiﬁcant dif- ference between the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group and the hy- drogel-alone group (p > 0.05), however, was there a signiﬁcant dif- ference between the expression of K1 in the hydrogel-BMSCs combination group and the BMSCs group (p > 0.05). These results show that the hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy had positive eﬀects on promoting the keratinocytes maturation. These results revealed that hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy promotes epidermis and dermis remodeling after wound healing. 4. Conclusions In summary, we showed the therapeutic eﬀect of a thermo-sensitive hydrogel in combination with BMSCs on skin wound healing. We dis- covered the hydrogel could provide a relatively aseptic and stable en- vironment for the wounds and the transplanted BMSCs, and it had positive eﬀects on the migration and proliferation of epithelial cells, the deposition of collagen, the secretion of growth factors and wound- healing quality. The hydrogel-BMSCs combination therapy exhibited a markedly therapeutic eﬀect than the hydrogel or BMSCs alone. Our study has introduced a new concept for treating skin trauma and sup- porting clinical treatment. However this work has limitations, the me- chanisms of BMSCs induced wound healing is not clear, the detailed signaling pathway need be explored in the future works.
