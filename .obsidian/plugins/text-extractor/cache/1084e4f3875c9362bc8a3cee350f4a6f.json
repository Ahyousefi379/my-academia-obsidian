(The physics of the impact process guarantees substantial burial of heat and high internal temperatures for any body ;;::Moon-sized, irre- spective of accretion time, unless the impacting bodies are unreasonably small.) My concern, however, is not so much to single out particular issues such as this but to advocate the importance of a balanced approach to the fundamental issues of atmospheric origin and evo- lution, in which the physical principles are developed more thoroughly than the style of this book allows. If this complaint seems subjective, my concern about the time-dependent coverage is most certainly objective, since it can be supported by statistics. For the years 1970-1971, Lewis and Prinn have 203 references. For the years 1980-1981 (comfortably 22 years before publication), they cite only 106 references. This is in no way a fair reflection of the relative level of activity in planetary science at those times. I disagree with their assertion in the preface that \"this (is a) period of slower expansion of knowledge .... \" The problem is also evident in the relatively small number of pages devoted to the giant planets or Titan (rather surprising in view of the authors' important contributions to un- derstanding these bodies). To be fair, I should point out that there are many recent references and I did not encounter really glaring omissions, but the imbalance is nevertheless self-evident and, most importantly, tends to influence the choice of models that the au- thors emphasize. It is because of these misgivings that I would not use this text as the basis for a course but rather as background reading or as a sourcebook for references. The book is generally well written, well organized, and essentially free offactual error in the areas where I am competent to judge. Typographical errors are present but not excessive (I noticed only two equa- tions thus affected). There are numerous useful tables and the many figures are generally informative and valuable (but why was Fig. 4.47, page 345, modified by hand?). Some students may find the detail overwhelm- ing, but I found the book to be stimulating reading because of the authors' insight and occasionally pro- vocative standpoint. (Do they really believe that the mechanism for heating the Moon is most probably the same one which heated the asteroids? Do they really believe that a late veneer of Cl material on Earth is \"merely an improbable assertion\" [see p. 213]? To me, their \"economies of hypothesis\" are merely mis- applications of Occam's Razor!) Despite my misgiv- ings, I recommend this book as an invaluable addition to the meager literature of quantitative planetary sci- ence.

Wiley, New York, 1983. 530 pp., $49.95. This book appears at a time when there seems to be an increasing interest in the scattering and absorption effects of various aerosols. It is of course preceded by the classic Light Scattering by Small Particles by van de Hulst and The Scattering of Light and Other Elec- tromagnetic Radiation by Kerker, and like these mon- ographs it presents the basic scattering theory for sin- gle particles. Bohren and Huffman have in addition elected to include a rather extensive discussion of the optical properties of bulk matter. Chapter 9 covers the classical theories of optical constants, and Chapter 10 presents representative measurements. Chapters 11 and 12 then examine the detailed role that the bulk optical properties play in determining particle absorp- tion and scattering characteristics. This emphasis on the optical properties of the parent material is quite welcome. Although it is generally recognized, for ex- ample, that the climatic effects of aerosols can be very sensitively dependent on particle composition, there still seems to be a tendency for some researchers to underestimate both the importance and difficulty of specifying appropriate optical constants. Although this book is not actually written as a text- book, its organization, completeness, and style are such that it is quite appropriate for the graduate stu- dent or researcher who wishes to use a single source to acquire a basic understanding of the subject. The au- thors have included a fairly comprehensive list of ap- propriate references, especially for the period since the appearance of Kerker's book in 1969. A brief Notes and Comments section at the end of each chapter except the last is particularly helpful in directing the reader who is interested in exploring some topics in greater depth. Because the subject of scattering is of interest to researchers from a wide range of disciplines, the selec- tion of appropriate notation and terminology is obvi- ously a challenging task. The authors indicate that they have taken the point of view of physicists in mak- ing such selections. In general, they seem to have adopted notation which has had widest use unless do- ing so would lead to ambiguity. Furthermore, they fre- quently mention alternative notation and terminology, thereby helping bridge the gap be ween disciplines. The rationale for choices between major alternatives is usually given, and the authors are not hesitant about criticizing common notation or terminology deemed inappropriate. Examples of the latter are phase func- tion and phase matrix, whose astronomical origin is quite logical, but which are cited because of potential ambiguity arising from the standard usage in charac- terizing electromagnetic wave propagation. In a set of three appendixes, the authors provide actual computer programs in standard Fortran for cal- culating scattering by a homogeneous sphere. a coated sphere, and a normally illuminated infinite cylinder. 722 BOOK REVIEWS These programs are straightforward in coding, well documented, and described using the notation em- ployed in the text. This reviewer has tested each of the programs on a different computer and with a compiler different from that used by the authors. Each program executed without difficulty and yielded the correct sample results. Thus, the reader can be assured that the program listings are completely free of typographi- cal errors. Absorption and Scattering of Light by Small Parti- cles is an excellent book. Its organization and empha- sis are quite appropriate. It is written in a very read- able style and appears remarkably free of errors. I recommend it highly for any planetary scientist inter- ested in the subject. LARRY D. TRAVIS NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Institute for Space Studies New York, New York 10025 Solar System Photometry. Edited by Russell M. Genet. Willman-Bell, Richmond, Va. Paperback. 184 pp., $17.95. Intended as a do-it-yourself guide for anyone with access to a small telescope, a photoelectric photome- ter, and the desire to investigate the solar system, this book sets as its goal \"to provide a concise introduction to solar system photoelectric photometry as currently practiced at smaller observatories.\" Dedicated (ac- cording to the editor) to \"the seemingly contradictory notion that serious scientific observations of solar-sys- tem objects can be made with small telescopes of back- yard amateurs and small-college professors and stu- dents,\" this paperback is divided into two major sections: Part 1 on low-speed photometry, and Part 2 dealing with high-speed photometric observations. The first part consists of six chapters and includes concise, yet comprehensive, treatments of the pho- tometry of asteroids (by R. P. Binzel), planets and satellites (by W. Lockwood), and comets (by M. F. A'Hearn). Each of these excellent contributions out- lines worthwhile observing programs which are within the reach of modest photoelectric equipment, recom- mends particular observing protocols, and describes data reduction techniques. Throughout, there is a healthy attitude that photometry is useful and interest- ing only to the extent that it helps us understand some important characteristic of the object being studied. Part 1, which makes up about two-thirds of the vol- ume, ends with a succinct review of low-speed photo- metric equipment by J. P. Hopkins. The remainder of the book deals with high-speed photometry in four excellent chapters. Occultations by planets and satellites are treated by R. L. Millis, as- teroid occultations by A. W. Harris, and lunar occulta- tions (of stars) by G. L. Blow. The approach differs somewhat from that in Part I in that reduction tech- niques (which in the case of occultation observations can be quite involved computationally) are summa- rized in outline form rather than presented in a do-it- yourself fashion. A final chapter by P. C. Chen de- scribes the portable high-speed photometer developed by R. Nather and D. Evans at the University of Texas to observe occultations of stars by the Moon. Missing is any mention of similar portable high-speed photom- eters developed at MIT and Lowell to observe plane- tary and asteroid occultations. While a serious amateur can still make significant contributions to the photometry of the Moon (an ob- ject badly neglected by most contemporary profes- sional astronomers), an innocent reader would fail to infer this fact from this book. The chapter dealing with the Moon could perhaps euphemistically be called an enigma. Its author, apparently unaware of much that has happened in the field of lunar photometry in the past twenty years, refers to a 1959 paper based on photographic photometry as \"a particularly important source.\" In fact, his most recent references to techni- cal papers on lunar photometry are the 1961 contribu- tions by Barbier and Minnaert to the venerable, but obsolete, Planets and Satellites (edited by Kuiper and Middlehurst). That most of the discussion in the lunar photometry chapter is based on obsolete photographic results is a strange anomaly in an otherwise up-to-date volume devoted to photoelectric observations. It is also peculiar that this chapter contains no discussion of how the proposed program of observations would enhance our current understanding of the Moon. Overall, the book is definitely a success! It will be very useful to its intended audience: amateurs, stu- dents, and astronomers looking for modest photomet- ric projects that involve the solar system. It is also an excellent place for today's overly sophisticated gradu- ate student in planetary science (the type who knows more about mangling data with a large computer than about obtaining them at a telescope) to find out how photometry of solar system objects is really done. The book may also have social merit: it could be useful to astronomers and planetary scientists in general to help them understand what it is that their colleagues who are hooked on solar system photometry actually do when they disappear from their offices for observing runs.
