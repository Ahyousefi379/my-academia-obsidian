S2    Materials. [Fe3O(OAc)6(H2O)3]OAc and H4TBP were synthesized as described previously. 1,2 All other starting materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Fisher (USA), unless otherwise noted, and used without further purification. Cell lines and animals. Murine colon adenocarcinoma cell, CT26, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (GE Healthcare, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, VWR, USA). The medium was mixed with 100 U/mL penicillin G sodium and 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate. Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks) were obtained from Harlan-Envigo Laboratories, Inc (USA). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Chicago. Preparation of Fe-TBP. To a 4 mL glass vial was added 0.5 mL of Fe3O(OAc)6(H2O)3(OAc) solution [2.2 mg/mL in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)], 0.5 mL of H4TBP solution (1.32 mg/mL in DMF), and 100 μL of formic acid. The reaction mixture was kept in an 80 °C oven for 24 hours. The purple precipitate was collected by centrifugation (14,100 G) and washed with DMF and ethanol. Fe-TBP of different size was synthesized by tuning the overall reaction concentration, including Fe3O(OAc)6(H2O)3(OAc), H4TBP, and formic acid (Supplementary Fig. 2). Fe-TBP of 100 nm in length was obtained by halving the reagent concentrations. Fe- TBP of different morphology was also synthesized by tuning the amount of formic acid (Supplementary Fig. 2). X-ray absorption spectroscopy Data collection. Fe-TBP X-ray absorption data was collected at Beamline 20-BM at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. Spectra were collected at the Iron K-edge (7112 eV) in transmission mode. The X-ray beam was monochromatized by a Si(111) monochromater and detuned by 50% to reduce the contribution of higher-order harmonics below the level of noise. A metallic cobalt foil standard was used as a reference for energy calibration and was measured simultaneously with experimental samples. The incident (I0), transmitted (It), and reference (Ir) beam intensities were measured by 20 cm ionization chambers with gas compositions of 98% N2 and 2% Ar, 83% N2 and 17% Ar, and 100% N2, respectively. Data was collected over three regions: -200 to -20 eV (10 eV step size, integration time of 1.00 s), -20 to -50 eV (1 eV step size, integration time of 1.0 s), 50 eV to 14.98 Å -1 k (0.05 k step size, integration time of 1 s). Three X-ray absorption spectra were collected at room temperature for each sample. Samples were ground and mixed with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and packed in a 6-shooter sample holder to achieve adequate absorption length. Data processing. Data was processed using the Athena and Artemis programs of the IFEFFIT package based on FEFF 6. 1,2 Prior to merging, spectra were calibrated against the reference spectra and aligned to the first peak in the smoothed first derivative of the absorption spectrum, the background noise was removed, and the spectra were processed to obtain a normalized unit edge step. EXAFS fitting. Fitting of the EXAFS region was performed using the Artemis program of the IFEFFIT package. Fits were performed in the R space, with a k-weight of 3 for the Fe sample. S3    Refinement was performed by optimizing an amplitude factor S02 and Debye-Waller factor (σ 2). The fitting model for Fe-TBP was based on the crystal structure LERZUD obtained from Cambridge Crystallographic Database. (Supplementary Table S1) Oxygen generaton. 150 µM of H2O2 was incubated with 50 µM of Fe-TBP in oxygen-free PBS at 37 °C, followed by measuring the dissolved O2 concentration with an oxygen meter (Xylem, USA) at 5 minute intervals for one hour. Singlet oxygen generation Singlet oxygen generation under normoxic condition. Fe-TBP, Hf-TBP, or H4TBP suspension was prepared with an equivalent ligand dose of 5 μM in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). To 2 mL each of these suspensions, SOSG stock solution (5 µL at 5 mM) was added (final concentration=12.5 µM) before fluorescence measurements. The mixed solution was exposed to LED light (100 mW, 650 nm) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300, and 420 seconds and the fluorescence at different time points was measured by a fluorimeter. Singlet oxygen generation under hypoxic condition. Fe-TBP, Hf-TBP, or H4TBP suspension was prepared at an equivalent ligand dose of 5 μM in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). To 2 mL each of these three suspensions, SOSG stock solution and H2O2 was added to afford a final SOSG concentration of 12.5 µM and H2O2 concentration of 100 µM. Another control group was prepared by adding only SOSG stock solution to Fe-TBP suspension without H2O2. Oxygen was then removed from these four mixtures by bubbling in nitrogen for 20 mins. These mixtures were subsequently exposed to an LED (100 mW, 650 nm) for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180, 300, and 420 seconds. The fluorescence at different time points was measured by a fluorimeter. Cellular uptake. The cellular uptake of Fe-TBP and Hf-TBP was evaluated in CT26 cells. Cells were seeded on 6-well plate at 1×10 6 cells per well and further cultured for 12 h. Particles were added to the cells at a Fe or Hf concentration of 20 µM. After incubation for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours, the cells were collected and the cell numbers were counted by a hemocytometer. Cells were digested with 1% hydrofluoric acid and concentrated nitric acid in a microwave reactor (CEM, USA) and the Hf concentrations were determined by ICP-MS (Agilent, USA). Results were expressed as the amount of Fe or Hf (nmol) per 10 5 cells. Hypoxia treatment. CT26 cells were subjected to hypoxia as described previously with modifications. 3 Briefly, CT26 cells were seeded on 6-well plate at 2×10 5 cells per well on the day before treatment. The medium was then exchanged for fresh medium and placed in an anaerobic chamber filled with 94.5% N2, 5% CO2 and 0.5 % O2 to induce hypoxia. The control cells were incubated in a normoxic condition containing 5% CO2 and 95% air (about 20% O2). Intracellular H2O2 assay. Intracellular H2O2 was detected by a MAK164 intracellular H2O2 kit (Sigma Aldrich, USA). For hypoxic condition, cells were cultured in the hypoxic chamber for 12 hours and further incubated with PBS, H4TBP, or Fe-TBP at an equivalent ligand dose of 10 μM for 4 hours. Then the medium was replaced by assay buffer and incubated for another S4    1 hour. After washing with PBS, intracellular H2O2 was observed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). For the normoxic condition, cells was treated with 100 μM of H2O2 for 12 hours and then further incubated with PBS, H4TBP, or Fe-TBP at an equivalent ligand dose of 10 μM for 4 hours. Then the medium was replaced by assay buffer and incubated for another 1 hour. After washing with PBS, intracellular H2O2 was observed through fluorescent imaging. HIF-1α immunostaining. Hypoxia levels were evaluated with the ab190197 antibody that has been conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 fluorochrome against HIF-1α (Abcam, USA) both in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro studies, CT26 cells were incubated in normoxic and hypoxic conditions and further incubated with PBS, H4TBP, or Fe-TBP at an equivalent ligand dose of 10 μM for 4 hours. The hypoxic photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment was performed inside the anaerobic chamber. Cells were then stained with the antibody against HIF-1α (ab190197, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and DAPI subsequently then observed by CLSM. For in vivo immunofluorescence imaging, CT26 tumor bearing mice were treated with H4TBP, Hf-TBP, or Fe-TBP at a dose of 0.2 µmol TBP intratumorally. Mice treated with PBS served as a control. Tumors were excised and the sections were air-dried for at least 1 h and then fixed in acetone for 10 min at 20 °C. After stained with Alexa Fluor 488-HIF-1α and DAPI, the sections were then washed twice with PBS and observed under CLSM. In vitro singlet oxygen generation. A light-emitting diode (LED) array with peak emission at 650 nm was used as the light source for singlet oxygen generation tests. The irradiance of this LED is 20 mW/cm 2. Singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) reagent (Life Technologies, USA) was employed for the detection of singlet oxygen under dark and light irradiation in hypoxic or normoxic conditions, respectively. CT26 cells were seeded on cover slides in 6-well plate at 2×10 5 cells per well and further cultured for 12 hours. H4TBP, Hf-TBP, or Fe-TBP was added to the cells at an equivalent ligand dose of 10 μM. Cells incubated with PBS served as a control. SOSG was added 15 mins before light irradiation. After incubation of 4 hours, cells were irradiated by LED for 15 minutes. The slides were then washed with PBS and observed under CLSM. Apoptosis assay. The apoptosis induced by PDT treatment was determined by flow cytometry using an Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V/dead cell apoptosis kit (Invitrogen, USA). CT26 cells were seeded on 6-well plate at 2×10 5 cells per well and further cultured for 12 hours. H4TBP, Hf-TBP, or Fe-TBP was added to the cells at an equivalent ligand dose of 10 μM. Cells incubated with PBS served as a control. After incubation of 4 hours, cells were irradiated by LED for 15 minutes. For optical imaging, cells were directly observed and images were captured under a stereomicroscope (Olympus, Japan). For confocal microscopy, cells were washed with PBS, stained with the apoptosis kit and observed under CLSM. For flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized and washed with PBS after incubation for 24 additional hours and stained for flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity of H4TBP, Hf-TBP, or Fe-TBP was evaluated with 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) S5    assay (Promega, USA) under dark and light irradiation in hypoxic or normoxic conditions, respectively. Dark cytotoxicity was first tested without LED irradiation. CT26 cells were seeded on 96-well plates at 2×10 4 cells per well and further cultured for 12 hours. H4TBP, Hf- TBP, or Fe-TBP were added to the cells at an equivalent ligand dose of 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μM. The cells were further incubated for 72 hours before determining the cell viability by MTS assay. To determine the cytotoxicity under light irradiation in the hypoxic condition, cells were seeded on 96-well plates at 2×10 4/well and cultured for 12 hours. Then cells were transferred into the anaerobic chamber and further incubated for 6 hours. H4TBP, Hf-TBP or Fe-TBP were added to the cells at an equivalent ligand dose of 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μM. Cells were then irradiated by LED for 15 minutes after incubation of 4 hours. The cells were further incubated for 72 hours before determining the cell viability by MTS assay. To determine the cytotoxicity with light irradiation under normoxic condition, cells were seeded on 96-well plates at 2×10 4 cells per well and further cultured for 18 hours. H4TBP, Hf- TBP, or Fe-TBP was added to the cells at an equivalent ligand dose of 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μM. Cells were then irradiated by LED for 15 minutes after incubation of 4 hours. The cells were further incubated for 72 hours before determining the cell viability by MTS assay. CRT assay. The immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by PDT treatment was investigated by detecting cell-surface expression of calreticulin (CRT) both in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro studies, CT26 cells were seeded in 6-well plates on cover slides overnight and incubated with H4TBP, Hf-TBP, or Fe-TBP at 10 μM based on TBP ligand concentration for 4 hours followed by light irradiation for 0 or 15 minutes (λmax = 650 nm, 20 mW/cm 2). Cells were then cultured in the incubator for another 4 hours to induce CRT exposure. For confocal imaging, cells were stained with AlexaFluor 488-CRT and DAPI, and observed under CLSM. For flow cytometry, cells were stained with AlexaFluor 488-CRT for cytometry analysis. For in vivo immunofluorescence imaging, CT26 tumor bearing mice were intratumorally treated with H4TBP, Hf-TBP, or Fe-TBP at a TBP dose of 0.2 µmol. Mice treated with PBS served as a control. Tumors were excised and the sections were air-dried for at least 1 h and then fixed in acetone for 10 min at 20 °C. After stained with AlexaFluor 488-CRT and DAPI, the sections were then washed twice with PBS and observed under CLSM. In vivo anticancer effect. For the evaluation of PDT efficacy of Fe-TBP, Hf-TBP, and H4TBP, 2×10 6 CT26 cells were injected into the right flank subcutaneous tissues of Balb/c mice on day 0 as a single tumor CT26 model. When the tumors reached 100-150 mm 3 in volume, Fe-TBP, Hf-TBP, or H4TBP at a TBP dose of 0.2 µmol or PBS was injected intratumorally. 4 hours after injection, mice were anaesthetized with 2% (v/v) isoflurane and the tumors were irradiated once with LED lamp at a dose of 100 mW/cm 2 for 7.5 minutes. An Fe-TBP group without irradiation served as control for dark toxicity. The tumor sizes were measured with a caliper every day and the tumor volume equals (width 2 × length)/2. Body weight of each group was monitored every day. Mice were sacrificed on Day 22 and the excised tumors were photographed and weighed. Tumors and major organs were sectioned for hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) and immunofluorescence analysis. S6    Tumor retention study. To verify the excretion/metabolism of Fe-TBP after intratumoral injection into CT26 tumor-bearing mice, tumor retention of injected Fe-TBP was quantified by ICP-MS analysis of Fe contents. Tumors were excised 4 h, 124 h or 244 h after injection and digested with 10% hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in a microwave reactor (CEM, USA) and the Fe concentrations were determined by ICP-MS (Agilent, USA). Tumors with similar size without intratumoral injection of Fe-TBP served for background subtraction of intrinsic Fe. Abscopal effect. For the evaluation of Fe-TBP-enabled PDT combined with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, 2×10 6 and 1×10 6 CT26 cells were injected into the right and left flank subcutaneous tissues of Balb/c mice on day 0 to mimic primary and distant tumors, respectively, in this bilateral syngeneic CT26 model. When the primary tumors reached 100- 150 mm 3 in volume, Fe-TBP at TBP dose of 0.2 µmol or PBS was injected intratumorally. 4 hours after injection, mice were anaesthetized with 2% (v/v) isoflurane and the primary tumors were irradiated once with LED lamp at a dose of 100 mW/cm 2 for 7.5 minutes. Anti-PD-L1 antibody was given every three days by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 75µg/mouse. Mice treated with PBS with light irradiation or antibody with light irradiation served as controls. Mice were euthanized on Day 21 and the excised tumors were photographed and weighed. Tumors and major organs were sectioned for H&E and immunofluorescence analysis. CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, and B cell depletion. The anticancer efficacy of combined Fe-TBP- enabled PDT and anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy was evaluated using the single tumor subcutaneous CT26 model in BALB/c mice with T cell or B cell depletion. For T cell depletion, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 250 mg anti-CD4 (GK1.5, Bio X Cell), anti-CD8 (53-6.7, Bio X Cell), or rat IgG (Bio X Cell) antibody twice every five days (days 7 and 12 after tumor inoculation). For B cell depletion, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg Ibrutinib (PCI-32765, Selleckchem) for a total of 5 fractions on consecutive days. Tumor challenge studies. The immune memory effect was evaluated with tumor challenge studies. 2×10 6 CT26 cells were inoculated on the right flanks of mice and treated with Fe-TBP- enabled PDT and anti-PD-L1 antibody as described in the efficacy test. Six out of ten mice had their tumors completely eradicated after treatment. On day 30 post tumor eradication, the cured Balb/c mice were challenged with 2×10 6 CT26 cells on their contralateral flanks. Healthy mice were simultaneously inoculated as control. The tumor size was measured with a caliper every day and the tumor volume equals (width 2 × length)/2. Statistical analysis for all of the challenges was performed using the log-rank Kaplan-Meier estimation. The mice were sacrificed when the size of the right tumors in the PBS group exceeded 2 cm 3.   ELISPOT assay. Tumor-specific immune responses to IFN-γ were measured in vitro by ELISPOT assay (Mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT Ready-SET-Go!; Cat. No. 88-7384-88; eBioscience). A Millipore Multiscreen HTS-IP plate was coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Mouse IFN-γ capture antibody. Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were obtained from CT26 tumor- bearing mice treated with Fe-TBP-enabled PDT and anti-PD-L1 antibody or PBS control and S7    seeded onto the antibody-coated plate at 2×10 5 cells per well. Cells were incubated with or without SPSYVYHQF stimulation (10 mg/ml; in purity >95%; PEPTIDE 2.0) at 37 °C for 42 h and then the suspension was discarded. The plate was then incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-IFN-γ detection antibody at r.t. for 2 h, followed by incubation with Avidin-HRP at r.t. for 2 h. 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate solution (Sigma, Cat. AEC101) was added for cytokine spot detection. Flow cytometry. Tumor-draining lymph nodes were collected and ground by the rubber end of a syringe in cell strainers. Tumors were harvested, treated with 1mg/ml collagenase I (Gibco, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C water bath and ground by the rubber end of a syringe. Cells were filtered through nylon mesh filters with size of 70 µm and washed with PBS. The single-cell suspension was incubated with anti-CD16/32 (clone 93; eBiosciences) to reduce nonspecific binding to FcRs. Cells were further stained with the following fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: CD45 (30-F11), CD3e (145-2C11), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (53-6.7), Foxp3 (FJK-16s), CD11b (M1/70), Ly6C (HK1.4), Ly6G (RB6-8C5), F4/80 (BM8), B220 (RA3-6B2), and PI staining solution (all from eBioscience). LSR FORTESSA (BD Biosciences) was used for cell acquisition and data analysis was carried out with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Immunofluorescence assay for T cells. Tumor sections were air-dried for at least 1 h and then fixed in acetone for 10 min at 20 °C. After blocked with 20% donkey serum, the sections were incubated with individual primary antibodies against CD3e (eBioscience) and CD8 (Thermo Scientific) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with dye-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at r.t. After stained with DAPI for another 10 min, the sections were then washed twice with PBS and observed under CLSM. Data availability.
