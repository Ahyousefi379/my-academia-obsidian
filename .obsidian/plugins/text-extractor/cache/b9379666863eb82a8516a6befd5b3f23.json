Although some advances have been made in targeting delivery of antitumor drugs over the past number of years, there are still many problems needing to be solved, such as poor eﬃcacy and high systemic toxicity. Micro/nanomotors capable of self-propulsion in ﬂuid provide promising platforms for improving the eﬃciency of tumor delivery. Herein, the recent progress in micro/ nanomotors for tumor targeting delivery and therapy is reviewed, with special focus on the contributions of micro/nanomotors to the diﬀerent stages of tumor targeting delivery as well as the combination therapy by micro/ nanomotors. The present limitations and future directions are also put forward for further development. 1. Introduction Due to the high mortality and limited eﬀective treatment, can- cer is considered the most intractable disease to mankind. De- spite great eﬀorts have been devoted to conquer this disease in the whole world these years, the actual therapeutic eﬃcacy is not ideal. The main constraint is the limited delivery of drugs to tar- get sites that only 0.7% of the administered nanoparticles could enter into solid tumors.[1] Therefore, how to enhance the delivery of drugs to tumor sites is the key problem for improved eﬃcacy of cancer therapy. The rapid ﬂow of blood is the ﬁrst obstacle af- ter systematic administration, and then the mononuclear phago- cytic system (MPS) and renal clearance compete drugs with tumor sites.[2] Still, it is diﬃcult for the escaped drugs to get into tumors. As is known, the heterogeneity of tumors such as R. Lin, Dr. X. Chen College of Materials Science and Engineering Sichuan University Chengdu 610064, P. R. China E-mail: chenxianchun@scu.edu.cn R.

With the rapid development of nanoparticles and novel biomaterials, micro/nanomotors represent an emerging system for drug delivery. Though it is still in an infancy stage and faces many chal- lenges, the characteristic of controllable re- mote steering enables micro/nanomotors to get rid of the reliance on blood ﬂow and random diﬀusion, which brings a new dawn to cancer therapy. Diﬀerent from the ordinary nanoparticles, micro/nanomotors can be self-propelled by converting the surrounding energies into mechanical motion, which breaks the shackles of irregu- lar Brownian motion and low Reynolds number on the move- ment of objects at micro and nanoscales. [4] The propelling force facilitates micro/nanomotors with the ability to cross biologi- cal barriers, such as dense extracellular matrix, blood–brain bar- rier and blood-tumor barrier in an autonomous manner, rather than passively circulating through the ﬂow of blood. [5] There- fore, micro/nanomotors are considered of great potential for tu- mor targeting delivery as well as the deep tumor penetration. Moreover, the special movement also determines the particu- larity of their entrance into cells. It has been reported that the self-propelled micro/nanomotors tend to exhibit a more rapidly cellular internalization without getting trapped or degraded in lysosomes. [6] This unique nature makes micro/nanomotors as good carriers for gene therapy. In addition, the direction and ve- locity of this particular locomotion can be manipulated either by the taxis nature of micro/nanomotors, the external ﬁeld (ultra- sound, magnetic ﬁeld, and temperature gradient), or the asym- metric geometry structure.[7] Therefore, micro/nanomotors can be literally designed to target anywhere at any speed, showing a totally active manner in every step during the drug delivery process, which is a quite unique advantage over other tradi- tional nonself-driven nanomaterials, such as silica, poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), gold nanoparticles, etc. With all these advantages, micro/nanomotors are gradually further combined with other antitumor therapies, such as photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and responsive on-demand drug release, having achieved promoted antitumor eﬃcacy. In this review, we focus on the applications of micro/ nanomotors in drug delivery to tumor sites (Figure 1). First, a Adv.

A schematic presentation of micro/nanomotors for drug delivery. brief introduction of micro/nanomotors is presented. We clas- sify the micro/nanomotors into three types: chemical-powered, fuel-free, and biohybrid by diﬀerent mechanism of motion force. Then, we comprehensively summarize the applications of mi- cro/nanomotors in drug delivery according to the process after systematic administration. The advantages of micro/nanomotors are fully illustrated from the beginning of circulation in blood, tumor targeting, cellular internalization, to the ﬁnal destina- tion of drug release. Furthermore, we extend the applications of micro/nanomotors to the combination with other therapeu- tic strategies. Progress of the combination therapy further put the prospect of micro/nanomotor forward to a more widespread application. Based on the reviewed studies, we discuss the chal- lenges and future directions of micro/nanomotors in the last part for better development in antitumor drug delivery. 2. Category of Micro/Nanomotors With the technology moving forward, a variety of mi- cro/nanomotors that can propel in ﬂuid have arose. These Adv.

[8] The three main types of micro/nanomotors are chemical powered, fuel-free, and biohybrid micro/nanomotors and each of them has its own traits. Hence, for this part, we are going to introduce mi- cro/nanomotors brieﬂy based on the source of their impetus with some typical examples enumerated for better understanding. 2.1. Chemically Propelled Micro/Nanomotors The chemical propelled micro/nanomotors can harness local chemicals to acquire driving forces from speciﬁc catalytic or spontaneous reactions in the ﬂuids. This requires the integration of catalysts or reactants into system and corresponding substrates as fuels. In the design of these fuel-driven micro/nanomotors, a wide range of substances, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), glu- cose, urea, and other chemicals, have been chosen to provide suf- ﬁcient energy for power. Among them, H2O2 is the most widely used fuel. This can be attributed to the reason that many met- als can catalytically convert the H2O2 into water and oxygen (O2) to form gas bubbles or concentration gradients that can propel motion of micro/nanomotors. For instance, Ma et al. fabricated Janus nanomotors by depositing a thin layer of Pt on the one hemisphere of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Figure 2A).[9] The Pt played the role of catalyst to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2. The catalytic reactions asymmetrically taking place at the surface of particles generate concentration gradients of oxy- gen around particles, in which the particles can be propelled by self-diﬀusiophoresis. In 2004, Paxton et al. developed the ﬁrst nanorod motors (Figure 2B). [10] With a diameter of 370 nm and a length of about 2 µm, the bimetallic Pt/Au nanorods could move autonomously in a solution of H2O2 by catalyzing the decompo- sition of H2O2. However, the movement direction of nanorods was not toward Au end as researchers expected but toward Pt end. Therefore, they ruled out the mechanism of bubble recoil and tentatively attributed the motion to the interfacial tension gradient created around the rods. But the explanation seems not convincing enough. Since then, more eﬀorts were devoted to the exploration of the motion mechanism of nanorods.[11] Later stud- ies pointed the mechanism to self-electrophoresis (Figure 2C). In this case, the Pt and Au segments together form a galvanic cell in the H2O2 solution. The electrochemical decomposition of H2O2 occurred at both Pt and Au end, with an oxidation reaction at Pt end and reduction reaction at Au end, respectively. This asym- metric reaction resulted in a higher concentration of proton at Pt side and caused current from Pt electrodes to Au electrodes due to the ﬂow of protons. Consequently, the negatively charged nanorod moved in this self-generated electric ﬁeld toward the Pt end of the rod. [11b] Based on this mechanism, Wang’s group mod- iﬁed the Pt/Au nanorods by incorporating carbon nanotubes into the Pt segment or substituting the Au segment with Au/Ag al- loy to achieve higher speeds.[12] The modiﬁcation of the anodic electrode or cathodic electrode increased the potential diﬀerence of the metal pair and enhanced the electron transfer reaction of H2O2, thus resulting in the higher motion speed. [13] A majority of tubular micro/nanomotors are powered by bub- bles expelled from one opening of the cylindrical or conical tube. The recoil of bubbles then propels the micro/nanotubes to move forward. Generally, bubbles are expelled from the larger opening of tubes due to the Laplace pressure diﬀerence of gas slug in an open conical tube, which enable the monodirectional motion of Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2020, 2001212 © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH2001212 (3 of 19) www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de micro/nanotubes.[14] As for H2O2-fueled micro/nanotubes, de- composition of H2O2 occurring at the inner wall of tubes can produce oxygen bubbles. Vilela et al. presented a design of biconi- cal mesoporous silica microtubes (Figure 2D). [15] The microtubes were fabricated with the assistance of a polycarbonate template containing conical-shaped micropores and Pt nanoparticles were formed on the inner layer during the process. In H2O2 solutions, the tubular micromotor displayed autonomous motion powered by oxygen microbubbles ejected from one side. Moreover, they could be further modiﬁed with gold or silver nanoparticles or loaded with drugs for various applications. Unlike the aforementioned structures that have rigid mor- phologies, polymersomes built by assembly of amphiphilic copolymer blocks can be used to prepare micro/nanomotors as well. Wilson’s group has been making a plenty of researches in this area recent years.[16] They prepared polymersomes us- ing poly(ethylene glycol)-b-polystyrene (PEG-PS) as blocks, and the swollen polymersomes then folded inward under osmotic pressure to form a bowl-like shape, which they called as stomatocytes.[17] Each stomatocyte had a cavity where the catalyti- cal Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) were encapsulated during the shape transformation and a well-deﬁned opening, through which the fuel, H2O2, could get access to PtNPs. The generated O2 were also expelled from the opening, which gave a thrust to the stom- atocyte based on phoretic and bubble propulsion mechanisms. Except for the widely used Pt/H2O2 combination, other met- als and metal oxides that can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 are also applied for micro/nanomotors. [18] Jang et al. reported Au/Ru core–shell nanorods with an open-end at one side (Fig- ure 2E).[19] They found that the locomotion of Au/Ru core–shell nanorods was induced by the combination eﬀects of both self- electrophoresis and diﬀusiophoresis. On the one hand, the oxi- dation process of H2O2 occurred at the anode (Au) of the open end, while the reduction process occurred at the outer cathode (Ru). This redox reaction generated an electric ﬁeld, in which the nanorods could move toward the open end. On the other hand, the generated O2 could form a gradient that provided a diﬀusiophoretic force for nanorods. Except for pure metal, the well-developed material, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), is available in the design of micro/nanomotors. For example, the central Co2+ of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67, a sub- class of MOFs that consists of Co 2+ and 2-Methylimidazole) could catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 eﬃciently to pro- vide driven force.[20] Additionally, the applications of enzymes in micro/nanomotors provide more choices of biocompatible cat- alyst/fuel combinations. Janus nanomotors powered by sole catalase have been demonstrated in the study of Ma et al.[21] The catalase were covalently conjugated on the one side of mesoporous silica nanoparticles via a glutaraldehyde (GA) linker (Figure 2F). In the presence of H2O2, the nanomotors displayed self-propelled motion due to the chemo-phoretic mechanism generated by enzymatic reactions asymmetrically occurring at one side of Janus particles. Fuels other than H2O2 were also exploited to power micro/ nanomotors. For instance, Gao et al. designed iridium (Ir)- based Janus micromotors using hydrazine as the sole fuel (Figure 3A). [22] The Ir surface catalyzed the decomposition of hy- drazine to generate N2,H2,and NH3 as products, which formed a gradient to propel the motion of micromotors. Sen’s group designed bimetallic Cu-Pt and Ag-Pt nanorod motors that worked in aqueous halogen solutions powered by self-electrophoresis (Figure 3B,C). [23] The Pt end played the part of cathode where the halogen was reduced, while the Cu or Ag end functioned as an- ode that was oxidized. Wang et al. presented self-propelled micro- motors based on Au–SiO2 nanorods. [24] Having been monodis- persed in one end of mesoporous silica nanorods, the Au nanoparticles could catalyze the hydrolysis of borohydride salts (NaBH4 and KBH4) and the decomposition of H2O2, generating H2 and O2 bubbles to provide thrust. When it comes to the biomedical purpose, one of the most cru- cial aspects needing to be considered is its nontoxicity to the body. However, most existing chemically powered micro/nanomotors are fueled by substances that are toxic, such as H2O2, which will bring extra impairment when applied for biomedical use. There- fore, to avoid the toxicity of extra added fuels, molecules that exist in the body are harnessed to provide driven force for mi- cro/nanomotors. Glucose is the main energy source of organ- isms. Its advantage as fuel for micro/nanomotors mainly is that it can replace the extra added H2O2 by integrating glucose oxidase and catalase. Catalyzed by glucose oxidase, glucose can be con- verted into glucuronic acid and H2O2. The generated H2O2 can subsequently be decomposed into harmless O2 and H2O by cata- lase to power micro/nanomotors. The enzymatic cascade of glu- cose oxidase and catalase have been veriﬁed in many studies.[25] In order to acquire sustained movement with constant speed, Ni- jemeisland et al. proposed a more complicated design of micro- motors that mimicked the enzymatic reactions existing in living systems (Figure 3D). [26] In this study, an enzymatic reaction net- work based on four metabolic cycles were compartmentalized in stomatocytes. The out-of-equilibrium reaction was activated by ATP-dependent converting of glucose and phosphoenolpyruvate, and then the pyruvate−L-lactate cycle generated H2O2 that was decomposed into O2 by catalase in the motor cycle. The speed of motor was independent of substrate concentration, while ATP played the role of regulating the entire metabolic network. Under the out-of-equilibrium conditions, the system could be precisely regulated and produce sustained output. Micro/nanomotors that utilize urea as fuel attract a lot of at- tention as well. [27] Ma et al. designed urea-powered microcap- sule motors using urease as catalyst (Figure 3E). [28] In this study, the urease was immobilized on the one side of hollow meso- porous silica microparticles following the e-beam deposition of Fe/Au layer on the other side. The self-propulsion derived from the asymmetrically enzymatical decomposition of urea into CO2 and NH3, which induced a gradient of concentration, giving rise to the self-diﬀusiophoresis of the Janus particles. Moreover, by adding the Ag+/Hg 2+ or dithiothreitol, the motion of motors was reversibly controlled due to the inhibition or reactivation of enzymatic activity. The recently reported study further demon- strated that Janus micromotors with multilayered assembly of urease have more powerful propulsion than that with monolay- ered urease. [29] Water and acid can be used as locally available fuels because of their ability to react with active metals. In many designs of micro/nanomotors with water/acid as fuel, the hydrogen bub- bles generated from the reaction between water/acid and active Adv.

[30] Fur- thermore, after reactions, the metal frameworks, such as Mg, Fe, and Zn, can produce corresponding ions Mg2+,Fe 2+,and Zn2+. These ions are biocompatible and even have beneﬁts to the tissue.[31] Wu et al. reported a cell-mimicking Janus micro- motor powered by Mg-water reaction for attracting and neutral- izing toxins in biological ﬂuids (Figure 3F). [30c] The micromotor had a Mg microparticle core and a three-layer shell that consisted of red blood cell (RBC) membranes, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and alginate. The exposed site of Mg microparticle could spon- taneously react with water in biological medium to produces hy- drogen bubbles. The antifouling property of RBCs protected the motor from protein fouling eﬀects in biological ﬂuids, and the AuNPs participated in the macrogalvanic corrosion of the oxide passivation layer on the Mg surface, both of which ensured the high eﬃciency and continuous propulsion of motor. The other advantage of water/acid-powered micro/nanomotors is that they run along with their own degradation. In the study of Chen et al., a series of transient micromotors powered by water or acid were designed (Figure 3G). [32] These micromotors were made of Mg/ZnO, Mg/Si, Zn/Fe, or single Zn and the asymmetrically re- action with water or gastric acid generated hydrogen bubbles to propel the autonomous motion in a variety of media. They un- derwent a self-destroy process during operation and dissolved completely after ﬁnishing their tasks. Moreover, due to the dif- ferent corrosion rates of diﬀerent components, the duration of micromotors could be tailored to have programmable transiency behaviors. Adv.

Fuel-Free Micro/Nanomotors Although chemically powered micro/nanomotors display good motion behaviors, the toxicity of fuels or products is still a non-negligible barrier on their way to practical application. Fuel-free micro/nanomotors that can be actuated by external ﬁelds provide an alternative way to induce motion of objects at small scales while avoiding the use of chemical fuel. The driven forces originated from external ﬁelds can be facilely controlled by manipulating the parameters of applied ﬁelds. Electric, optical, ultrasonic, and magnetic ﬁelds are commonly and widely exploited external ﬁeld. 2.2.1. Electrically Propelled Micro/Nanomotors Electric ﬁelds can be used to propel micro/nanomotors based on various mechanisms, such as electric tweezers, electrically triggered chemical reactions, and electro-osmotic nature at a low-frequency electric ﬁeld.[8a] Electric tweezers are nanoma- nipulation technique that use direct current or alternating cur- rent electric ﬁelds to manipulate nanoentities suspended in liq- uid, which is extensively applied for assembly and rotation of nanomotors.[33] Kim et al. reported rotary nanomotors consisted of Au/Ni/Au nanowires as rotors, patterned nanomagnets as bearings, and quadruple microelectrodes as stators. [34] By using electric tweezers, the nanowire could be precisely anchored on the patterned magnetic bearing along predetermined trajecto- ries to eﬃciently assemble the nanomotors, and the arrays of nanomotors rotated with speed over 18 000 rpm by electric ﬁelds. Loget and Kuhn demonstrated the motion of objects with sizes ranging from centimeters to hundreds of micrometers induced by bipolar electrochemistry (Figure 4A).[35] The polarization of a conducting particle in an electric ﬁeld could trigger spatially separated electrochemical redox reactions that occurred on the two sides of the particles. The water splitting could be carried out at both poles of a bipolar object with oxidation reactions at the anodic pole, while reduction reactions at the cathodic pole. To maintain the electroneutrality of the bipolar electrode, the H2 volume produced at cathode was twice the O2 volume produced at anode. This asymmetric bubble production induced the liner motion of spherical particles and the speed could be controlled by redox chemistry species and design of device. Yamamoto et al. reported a helical micromotor exhibiting cork-screw-type rotation in a speciﬁc direction under stationary direct current electrostatic ﬁeld (Figure 4B).[36] Brieﬂy, spiral blue-green algae, namely, Spir- ulina, were utilized to prepare organic microhelixes or as biotem- plate for nickel microhelixes. Both microhelixes had two kinds of handedness, namely left-hand or right-hand. After delving into the spin behavior of the microhelixes and the inﬂuence factors of spinning direction, they found that the spinning directions of helixes depended on the physical property of materials as well as the handedness of helixes. The left-hand nickel and right- hand organic helixes spun in clockwise directions, whereas the right-hand nickel and left-hand organic helixes spun in anticlock- wise directions under the same electric ﬁeld. This diﬀerence was Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2020, 2001212 © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH2001212 (6 of 19) www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de attributed to the diﬀerent direction of ﬂow caused by anionic sur- factant in the medium, which drove the micromotor. Besides, re- versing the voltage can also make the helixes spin in the opposite direction. 2.2.2. Light-Driven Micro/Nanomotors Light-driven micro/nanomotors are able to move by convert- ing light energy into mechanical work. Asymmetric ﬁelds are needed around to acquire driving force. [37] Due to the wireless and remote propagation, precisely control of energy, and re- versible ON/OFF state of radiation of light, the light-driven mi- cro/nanomotors may be manipulated noninvasively with high precision space-time control. [38] Materials with photocatalytic ac- tivity, such as TiO2, [39] AgCl, [40] BiOI, [41] can be utilized for fab- ricating light-driven micro/nanomotors. Dong et al. designed a photocatalytic TiO2–Au Janus micromotor that could be powered in pure water at a speed of 25 body length/s under a low ultra- violet (UV) light intensity (Figure 4C). [39a] When the micromotor was exposed to UV light, the hole-electron separation triggered by photons could cause the transportation of electrons from TiO2 conduction band into the Au hemisphere, which triggered the redox reaction occurring on the two hemispheres of micromo- tors. The resulting ﬂux of protons then generated an electric ﬁeld that propelled the motor with the TiO2 hemisphere forward. Unlike chemically powered micromotors, the photocatalytic mi- cromotors need no additional fuel and their speed can be con- trolled by adjusting the light intensity. Later, Sridhar et al. pre- sented a Janus hollow mesoporous TiO2/Au micromotors with higher speed while requiring less UV light intensity because of the higher photocatalytic activity improved by the hollow meso- porous structure.[39b] In addition to UV light, near-infrared (NIR) light, [42] visi- ble light,[43] and even X-rays [44] can also be exploited to drive micro/nanomotors. Xuan et al. designed gold nanoshells (AuNSs)-functionalized Janus mesoporous silica nanoparticle motors (JMSNMs) driven by NIR light (Figure 4D).[42b] Due to the surface plasmon resonance absorption, the half-coated AuNSs could generate heat under NIR irradiation. The asym- metrically generated heat induced temperature gradients across the particles, in which the JMSNMs were propelled by ther- mophoretic forces. The speed and “on/oﬀ” motion of JMSNMs could be readily controlled by tuning the intensity of the NIR irradiation. Xu et al. developed micromotors actuated by more penetrating X-rays in aqueous solution recently. [44] In this study, the silica microparticles were half-coated with Cu, where the water radiolysis occurred to generate H2 bubble under the X-rays irradiation. As the bubble grew, the microparticle was propelled toward the advancing of bubble surface. The reason for this asymmetry was that the radiation dose transferred from metal to water was more than that from silica to water. Thus, the water radiolysis occurred at Cu/water interface was enhanced, which promoted the H2 bubble formation on the Cu surface. 2.2.3. Ultrasound-Powered Micro/Nanomotors As an energy with good directionality, strong penetration abil- ity, and minimal deleterious eﬀect, ultrasound has been widely used in many ﬁelds.[45] Micro/nanomotors powered by ultra- sound also attract considerable attention of scientists.[46] High frequency sound wave, especially in the MHz regime, is a power- ful tool for particle manipulation. Wang et al. explored the eﬀects of acoustical ﬁeld on metallic rods (Figure 5A).[47] They found that ultrasonic standing wave could levitate, propel, rotate, align, and assemble these objects in water as well as in ionic solution. The motion speed could be adjusted by varying the amplitude of ultrasonic waves, and the asymmetric shape of rods was respon- sible for the directional motion. Due to the preparation process, one end of the rod was always concave, while the other end is ﬂat or convex. The concave shape concentrated acoustic wave scat- tering on the surface, while the convex surface radiated the wave, which gave rise to the asymmetric distribution of acoustic pres- sure. Consequently, the rods could propel in this pressure gradi- ent. This mechanism is called self-acoustophoresis and many mi- cro/nanomotors based on this mechanism have been designed to apply for various purposes like eﬃciently delivery of siRNA and antitumor drug to cells.[48] Because the force induced by standing acoustic wave is larger than that induced by travelling wave, most of the existing acousti- cally powered micro/nanomotors are driven by standing wave.[45] However, micro/nanomotors that can be propelled by travelling wave are also reported recently by Ahmed et al. (Figure 5B).[49] They demonstrated a novel nanoswimmer taking advantage of structural resonances of objects. This nanoswimmer was com- prised of a rigid bimetallic Ni/Au head and a ﬂexible polypyrrole tail. The ﬂagellum-like tail of nanoswimmer could oscillate with small amplitude in an acoustic ﬁeld, which induced a steady local streaming ﬂow ﬁeld. When the frequency approached the res- onance frequency of the tail, the oscillations of the tail would become large enough to induce translational motion of entire nanoswimmer. 2.2.4. Magnetically Propelled Micro/Nanomotors Locomotion induced by magnetic ﬁeld generally needs the incor- poration of magnetic components like Fe or Ni. [50] The magnetic ﬁeld can provide not only propulsion but also the guidance for micro/nanomotors, which makes it an ideal power source for fuel-free micro/nanomotors. According to the propulsion mech- anisms, magnetically propelled micro/nanomotors can be cate- gorized into three types: helical propellers, ﬂexible propellers, and surface walkers.[51] Helical propellers, also known as artiﬁcial bacterial ﬂagella (ABFs), are designed by imitating the helical bac- terial ﬂagella.[52] They can be propelled upon rotation imposed by rotating magnetic ﬁelds. [53] Tottori et al. reported a fabrication of ABFs making use of 3D laser writing and deposited Ni/Ti bilay- ers on the surface for magnetic actuation and improved surface biocompatibility. [54] The helical micromachines exhibited steer- able corkscrew motion in response to the rotating magnetic ﬁelds with suﬃciently high frequency. Flexible propellers acquire propulsion from the deformation of ﬂexible ﬁlaments. Gao et al. proposed ﬂexible metal nanowire swimmers with an Au head, Ni tail, and a ﬂexible Ag bridge to tether the two segments (Figure 5C). [55] The ﬂexibility of Ag bridge was conﬁrmed to be essential for the locomotion. The ro- tating magnetic ﬁeld caused the rotation of Ni and Ag segments Adv.

In addition, the direction of motion (for- ward or backward) could be controlled by tailoring the length of Ni and Au segments. Pak et al. fabricated a ﬂexible nanowire mo- tor consisted of a rigid Ni segment and an Ag tail in the same way.[51] In this case, the propulsion came from the chiral defor- mationofAgsegment. Surface walkers demand a surface to break the spatial symme- try to escape the constraints of the scallop theorem, i.e., purely reversible internal displacement does not lead to any net mo- tion in low Reynolds ﬂuid. [56] Based on this mechanism, Li et al. prepared microdimer surface walkers consisted of two Ni/SiO2 Janus microspheres connected by magnetic attraction, which could propel in oscillating magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 5D). [57] The magnetic torque acting on both spheres made the two hinged spheres move back and forth in an alternative and asymmetri- cally way, resulting to the net displacement of the microdimers. Another interesting research about magnetic micromotors was reported by Liu et al. recently.[58] In this study, they pre- sented a design and fabrication of shape-transformable liquid metal micromotors using Fe3O4 nanoparticles-incorporated eu- tectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) liquid metal. The micromotors displayed translational motion at the speed of over 60 µm s −1 Adv.

The magnetic ﬁeld acting on the micromotor could make the mo- tor wobbles rapidly, which immediately broke the symmetry of pressure distribution in ﬂuid and then led to the motion of micro- motors. Furthermore, due to the oxide layer of EGaIn was broken by local heat during the conversion from magnetic energy, the liquid metal micromotors could undergo a morphological trans- formation. 2.3. Biohybrid Micro/Nanomotors Nature has always provided human with inspiration for in- novation. Apart from the two categories of artiﬁcial micro/ nanomachines mentioned above, the chemotaxis or aﬃnity of living systems, such as whole cells or natural living micro- organisms, can be adopted to prepare self-propelled micro/ nanomotors. They are so-called biohybrid micro/nanomotors and have attracted much attention recent years. These biological microswimmers are able to sense stimuli in the surrounding en- vironment and thus move toward the attractant.[59] As for biohy- brid micro/nanomotors, these living systems serve as engines to generate propulsion. Among them, motile bacteria represent an ideal engine to power micro/nanomotors, and there have been a lot of related studies.[60] Stanton et al. reported a simple method to prepare biohybrid swimmers by adhesion of Escherichia coli (E. coli) on metal-capped polystyrene (PS) Janus particles.[61] The E. coli moved themselves as well as the Janus particles in cell cul- ture media by the rotation of their ﬂagella. Later, the same group innovatively designed the ﬁrst tubular bacteria microswimmer by partially trapping single E. coli inside a polydopamine (PDA)- modiﬁed microtubes (Figure 5E).[62] The positively charged PDA layer on the inner of microtube acted as a surface attractant to the negatively charged E. coil, enabling the attachment of the bac- terium to the inside of the microtube. As a bioengine, the trapped E. coil pushed the microtube forward with an average velocity of 5 ± 1µms −1 and the authors found that compared with free bac- teria, the biohybrid swimmers displayed more directional trajec- tories. That phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that the alignment of bacterium inside the tube could impede the abil- ity of the cells to reorient. Moreover, because the NH3, generated from the hydrolysis of urea, can form a pH gradient to inhibit the motion of bacteria biohybrid motors, urease can be further mod- iﬁed on the PDA to control their motion. So that the possible risk of bacterial infection when used for medical application will be avoided. This can be utilized as a “kill switch” to avoid the arrival and reproduction of bacteria at undesired location. Spermatozoa is another living system that has been extensively exploited for biohybrid micro/nanomotors, due to its good bio- compatibility and autonomous motility. They are minimal cells that are consist of a head, a midpiece, and a tail, and the sperm tail is the ﬂexible segment that provide propulsion for entire cell. [63] Chemoattractants secreted from the egg and its surrounding cu- mulus cells, such as progesterone, can activate the chemotaxis of sperm to move along the gradients of attractants. [64] Chen et al. prepared free swimming functionalized sperm micromo- tors (FSFSMs), making use of intrinsic chemotactic characteris- tics of sperm (Figure 5F).[65] Various cargos could be loaded in the sperm cells via endocytosis process to prepare the FSFSMs for diverse propose. When exposed to egg cells or chemoattractants (a steroid secreted by Ciona egg cells, named SAAF in this case), the FSFSMs showed self-guided movement along the concentra- tion gradient of chemoattractant toward the egg cells or SAAF source. What is notable is that the FSFSMs could work in various biological solutions and not suﬀer from the speed reduction or fuel limitation, because their motion behaviors relied only on the movement of free sperm cells. Furthermore, the speed of motion can be controlled by changing the osmolarity of solution. When the osmotic pressure of solution decreased, the cells expanded, and the ﬂagellum length of sperm was shortened, which led to the lower speed of motion. Some design using other living systems are also reported. For example, taking advantage of chemotaxis of neutrophils to bac- teria such as E. coli, Shao et al. proposed biohybrid micromo- tors made of neutrophils and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) (Figure 5G).[66] The E. coli membrane was coated on MSNs in advance, and then the E. coli membrane camouﬂaged MSNs were taken up by neutrophils to prepare the micromo- tors. The resulting micromotors inherited the chemotaxis of neu- trophils and acquired the directional movement along chemoat- tractant gradients secreted by E. coli. Drugs like doxorubicin (DOX) can be further loaded for eﬃcient drug delivery. 3. Micro/Nanomotors for Tumor Targeting Drug Delivery Owing to the self-propelled property, which is one of the most prominent features of the micro/nanomotors, micro/ nanomotors have shown great potential in active cargo delivery.[67] An increasing number of studies have conﬁrmed that micro/nanomotors can improve tumor targeting deliv- ery, which is beneﬁcial for improving therapeutic eﬃcacy and reducing systemic toxicity. Hence, for this part, advances of micro/nanomotors in tumor targeting delivery in recent years are going to be reviewed. 3.1. Navigation in Blood Circulation Blood is a highly complex environment with both high viscosity and a mass of composition, such as blood cells, proteins, elec- trolytes, and other nutrients, [68] which may have considerable in- ﬂuence on drug carriers in the blood. Moreover, the high ﬂow rates also play an important role in the delivery of drugs to dis- ease area. Compared with traditional passive drug delivery vehi- cles that circulate just relying on blood ﬂow, micro/nanomotors have their own propulsion to achieve active motion, or even direc- tional motion,[69] making them more ideal for targeting delivery as carriers. However, the complex ﬂuidic environment still has inevitable impacts on the propulsion performance and stability of micro/nanomotors. [70] Therefore, the interactions between mi- cro/nanomotors and blood, as well as the underlying mechanism should be fully delved and elucidated. Fortunately, some studies have been conducted to investigate the issue and there have been some progresses over the past years. For example, Venugopalan et al. investigated the stability and motility of a magnetically pow- ered nanohelice in the fresh human blood (Figure 6A).[71] In this Adv.

Furthermore, when suspended in the blood, the ferrite- coated nanohelices still exhibited linear and rotating motion un- der the control of an external rotating magnetic ﬁelds. However, it was noted that their motion showed distinct stick-slip dynamics that diﬀered from the condition in water or other simple Newto- nian ﬂuids, which might be related to the colloidal jamming of blood cells. The motion behavior of a polymersome nanoswimmers in the ﬂowing ﬂuid that is more similar to the condition in the real blood circulation was investigated in the study of Joseph et al.[72] Glucose-fueled polymersomes can move in response to a glucose gradient that exists in the blood vessel from the center to the blood wall. Thereby, constant ﬂows of diﬀerent ﬂow rates were imposed perpendicularly to the glucose gradient to simulate con- ditions of next to the capillary barriers (10 µm s −1) and in the capillary center (150 µm s−1). The results showed that the poly- mersomes could still move toward the glucose gradient despite lower speeds in the presence of 10 µm s −1 ﬂow, whereas move in a direction of about 45° from the ﬂow line at a ﬂow rate of 150 µm s −1. Furthermore, they tested the chemotaxis of polymer- somes in the capillary by taking advantage of a vessel model. The results indicated that the binding of polymersomes to the vessel wall improved with the increasing of propulsion velocity and the size of polymersomes, which could promote the uptake of poly- mersomes from the blood. The more idealized design for micro/nanomotors is not only to endow them with ability of moving along but also with autonomous locomoting against blood ﬂow for controlled nav- igation and targeting. It would be more precise for targeting delivery if these small devices could move toward the desired direction under some guidance irrespective of the blood ﬂow. Once again, motile cells naturally present in the body is a shining example. Inspired by leukocytes capable of surface motion in ves- sels, Alapan et al. presented multifunctional surface microrollers steered by external rotating magnetic ﬁelds to achieve controlled navigation in blood ﬂow and targeted drug delivery into cancer cells. [73] The microrollers were composed of spherical Janus microparticles with a magnetically responsive Ni/Au half-side and a silica half-side. They showed upstream locomotion in the whole blood ﬂow within microﬂuidic channels mimicking physiological wall shear stress even on a curved or inclined surface, where there is an extra gravitational force acting on the microrollers. And the navigation performance can be manipu- lated by changing orientation and strength of applied magnetic ﬁelds. Another interesting study conducted by Xu et al. is about sperm-based micromotors. [74] In this study, they developed a hybrid sperm micromotor that could eﬃciently swim against the continuous and pulsatile ﬂowing blood (Figure 6B). Sperm were equipped with streamlined-horned cap (SHC) to form the sperm micromotors that could generate a high propulsive force to move in blood and showed rheotaxis capability to swim against the blood ﬂow. The magnetic SHC played the important role in their performance. It facilitated to squeeze through the blood cell crowds, helped for directional guidance by external magnetic ﬁeld, and acted as an anchor to hold the position of micromotor in strong pulsatile ﬂows. Moreover, drug-loaded liposomes could be further modiﬁed on the caps to be delivered. But the authors pointed that the propulsion force was still not strong enough to move in the large arteries, where the blood ﬂow velocity was much higher than small vessels. 3.2. Tumor Targeting Nanoparticles in the bloodstream need to pass through tumor vasculature endothelium to reach tumor tissue and then be in- ternalized by tumor cells. However, in this process, how to en- hance the targeted eﬃciency of drug delivery and reduce systemic side eﬀects is still a problem that needs to be solved. The motil- ity of micro/nanomotors may help in this process. Solid tumor has been reported to contain high level of H2O2. [75] Therefore, micro/nanomotors using H2O2 as fuel have the potential of tar- geting delivery of drugs to tumor by chemotaxis. [76] Peng et al. veriﬁed the ability of polymersome Janus nanomotors that used H2O2 as fuel for enhanced penetration across the tumor vascu- lature (Figure 6C).[77] They used a double-layer microslide that consisted of an upper and a bottom chamber, with a layer of ep- ithelial cells in the middle, to build a leaky vasculature model. The nanomotors were placed on the upper chamber, while the bottom chamber was ﬁlled with water or H2O2 solution. Com- pared with control groups that had water in the bottom cham- ber or used nonmotor polymersomes, the nanomotors exhibited more eﬃcient penetration across the endothelium layer to move toward the H2O2 richer area, which held great promise for en- hanced entry into tumor tissue from blood circulation. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) can protects central nervous system (CNS) from invaders, but its presence also poses a major chal- lenge to drug delivery to brain tumors. Joseph et al. reported a design of nanomotors to target CNS. [72] The asymmetric poly- mersomes were formed by two diﬀerent amphiphilic copolymers with glucose oxidase and catalase encapsulated and could pro- pel with glucose as fuel. Because of the highly eﬃcient glucose uptake of brain from cerebral vessels, there is a positive gradi- ent from the center to the wall of vessel. Therefore, the polymer- somes could move directionally toward the vessel wall due to the chemotaxis. By further functionalizing with Angiopep-2 that tar- gets the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP- 1, overexpressed on the BBB), [78] the polymersomes could cross BBB fast and the chemotactic polymersomes exhibited a fourfold delivery increase into the CNS than the nonchemotactic control. Rucinskaite et al. proposed a nanomotor-based strategy to im- prove the binding between nanoparticles and tumor cells, while reducing their interaction with healthy tissue. [79] The nanomo- tors were partially covered with glucose oxidase as power source and RGDS, a peptide that can target integrins overexpressed in tumors. It was pointed out that the motion of nanomotors could disrupts the binding between nanomotors and cell membrane, and this behavior enhanced with the increase of glucose concen- tration. Therefore, the nanomotors could selectively bind to the tumor cells instead of healthy tissue that have higher concentra- tion of glucose. [80] 3.3. Penetration within Tumor Solid tumor is a complicated place where have high heterogeneity. [81] Drugs delivered by the bloodstream are Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2020, 2001212 © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH2001212 (11 of 19) www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de hard to reach the parts distant from vasculature. [82] Therefore, it is imperative to engineer more strategies capable of penetrating deep into the tumor. The good news is some advances have been achieved.[83] Micro/nanomotors, capable of directional motion, also hold considerable potential to reach the deeper tumor.[84] Ramos-Docampo et al. designed microswimmers capable of penetrating the cancer spheroid (Figure 6D). [85] The microswim- mers used collagenase (Coll) as catalyst and collagen, an essential constituent of extracellular matrix (ECM), as fuel. They showed enhanced locomotion in both low-viscosity environment and more biologically relevant collagen gel in the presence of calcium as an activator of Coll. In this process, a calcium gradient was necessary for initiating the motion and achieving control over direction. The microswimmers could entry and penetrate the cell spheroid eﬃciently due to their capability of cleaving the collagen in the ECM. Hortelão et al. demonstrated the improving penetration of urease-powered nanomotors into the 3D bladder cancer spheroid (Figure 6E). [86] The active nanomotors in the presence of urea displayed a threefold higher internalization eﬃ- ciency than the passively diﬀusing controls. Furthermore, when the nanomotors were functionalized with antibody targeting the ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor that over-expressed in bladder cancer cells, the enhanced diﬀusion of nanomotors signiﬁcantly increased the chances of the contact between nanomotors and cancer cells, thus further improving the penetration and therapeutic eﬃciency. Biobybrid micro/nanomotors also exhibit great application value for deep tumor delivery. A majority of drug delivery nanocarriers currently in use fail to reach hypoxic area deep in the tumor, which greatly limited the therapeutic eﬃcacy. Based on this phenomenon, Felfoul et al. proposed a strategy to deliver drug-loaded nanoliposomes to tumor hypoxic regions.[60a] Mag- netococcus marinus strain MC-1 that have magneto-aerotaxis, can swim along local magnetic ﬁeld and preferentially migrate to and stay at the low oxygen concentrations. [87] By using this character- istic, the MC-1 cells were guided by targeting magnetic ﬁeld to penetrate from peritumoral regions to the hypoxic zone. In com- parison to the passive polymeric carriers, the MC-1 cells exhibited superior penetration depths in HCT116 xenografts and mainly concentrated at hypoxic and necrotic areas after peritumoral in- jection. A sperm-hybrid micromotor was presented by Xu et al. recently (Figure 6F).[88] The micromotor had a magnetic tetra- pod microstructure with a tubular body and four ﬂexible arched arms. Drug-loaded sperm head was mechanically trapped inside the cavity of the tubular body, while the sperm tail could still beat outside to provide propulsion. Upon the micromotors reached the cancer cell spheroid, under the guidance of external magnetic ﬁeld, the trapped sperms could be freed to swim into the tumor with the sperm beating. Hyaluronidases secreted by sperm al- tered the composition of ECM, which further enhanced the pen- etration. 3.4. Cellular Uptake After carriers reaching the tumor site, most of them need to be taken up by tumor cells to exert the therapeutic role. There are also various mechanisms for micro/nanomotors to open the cell membrane and enter into the cells, such as micro- drilling, permeabilization of cell membrane, and photomechan- ically opening, which has been discussed in previous review. [89] Many studies have demonstrated that the autonomous motion of micro/nanomotors can facilitate this process.[67b,90] For instance, Xuan et al. reported NIR light-powered Janus nanomotors ca- pable of percolating cell membranes (Figure 6G). [91] The NIR- induced self-propulsion increased the number of nanomotors adhering to the surface of cells, and then the heat generated by the photothermal eﬀect of Au half-shell perforated the cell mem- branes, leading to the enhanced cellular uptake of nanomotors. The similar strategy can also be applied in ultrasound-driven tubular nanoswimmers with gold-nanoshell functionalized for poration of single-cell membrane.[92] Additionally, Ultrasound- propelled nanomotors have been utilized for various applica- tions, such as the intracellular enzyme delivery, siRNA delivery, and biosensing at the single cell level. [48b,93] The rapid move- ment of nanomotors can overcome the biological barriers, signif- icantly improve the internalization, and thus enhance the deliv- ery eﬃciency. In the study of Esteban-Fernandez de Avila et al., ultrasound-propelled gold nanowires (AuNW) were used to de- liver siRNA into cells for gene silencing (Figure 6H). [48b] It is worth noting that unlike other ways that using either membrane fusion or endocytosis to enter the cells, the ultrasound-propelled nanomotors can pierce and penetrate into cells by mighty propul- sion. The AuNWs and cells preconcentrated into localized pres- sure nodes of acoustic ﬁeld, and once concentrated in these nodes, the nanomotors bombarded the cell wall, leading to the aggregation, piercing, and penetration into cells. The fast inter- nalization and rapid intracellular movement together led to ac- celerated siRNA delivery and silencing response. In addition, other cell penetrating strategy can be incorporated into the design of micro/nanomotors. Peng et al. proposed a stomatocyte nanomotor-based strategy for enhanced cell pene- trating and entry (Figure 6I).[94] Basically, the directional active motion of drug-loaded nanomotors could induce higher chances of interaction between carriers and target cells, leading to the enhanced cellular uptake. When combined with cell penetrating peptide, trans-activator of transcription (tat) peptide, the penetrat- ing ability of the nanomotors could be further improved. 3.5. Drug Release from Carriers Micro/nanomotors can achieve precise and controlled release of drugs at tumor site by tailoring their materials and structures. With this purpose in minds, many researchers have proposed constructive ideas for micro/nanomotors design for the past few years. Sun et al. reported a novel micromotor driven by NIR light, which showed potential for drug transportation and release (Figure 7A).[95] The rectangle micromotor (110 × 130 µm in size) was consisted of 20 nm spherical polypyrrole nanoparticles. When exerting an irradiation of NIR light from a tilted angle, the micromotor exhibited translational motion and triggered sur- rounding water ﬂow in the surfactant solution. However, when the light was applied from vertical direction or horizontal di- rection, the micromotor only showed surface water ﬂow behav- ior or translational motion, respectively. Besides, the NIR light Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2020, 2001212 © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH2001212 (12 of 19) www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de Figure 7.

Taking advantage of these characteristics, DOX was loaded into the micromotors, and the horizontal NIR light was ﬁrst applied to induce the translational motion to reach target site. Then, the vertical irradiation was applied to cause surround- ing ﬂuid ﬂow for the release of adsorbed DOX molecular. The authors pointed out that the change from hydrophobicity to hy- drophilicity and the surface water ﬂow around the micromotors both contributed the detachment of DOX from polymer surface. L-arginine can be converted into nitric oxide (NO) and L- citrulline by NO synthase (NOS) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) existing in the blood and cells.[96] As a vital gaseous signal molecule in human body, NO is capable of regulating systems in- cluding immune, nervous, and cardiovascular systems.[97] How- ever, the high concentration of NO is toxic to cells.[98] Inspired by these facts, Wan et al. presented an ingenious nanomotor-based strategy to ensure the intracellular drug release (Figure 7B). [99] In this study, they designed hyperbranched polyamide/L-arginine nanomotors that utilized L-arginine as fuel to produce NO both as driving force and anticancer agent. Due to the higher level of ROS in tumor tissue, the NO generated in tumor cells (more than 70%) was suﬃcient to cause cytotoxic eﬀects, while a small number of NO generated in normal tissue had the advan- tage of promoting revascularization. Moreover, the ﬂuorescent characteristic of nanomotors originating from hyperbranched polyamide made it possible to track nanomotors in vivo in the future. 3.6. Micro/Nanomotors for Gastrointestinal Drug Delivery Due to the special location of gastrointestinal cancer compared with other cancer, the therapy for gastrointestinal cancer may be achieved by gastrointestinal administration. Therefore, some studies have designed self-propelled micro/nanomotors for gas- trointestinal characteristics. Generally, these micro/nanomotors are mainly fueled by hydrochloric acid or water in the gastroin- testinal tract, and their behaviors and functionalities have been tested in vivo at the animal level due to the higher safety of gas- trointestinal administration. For example, in the study of Gao et al., gastric acid-fueled micromotors were prepared by deposit- ing Zn layer in the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) microtubes (Figure 7C). [100] The tubular micromotors were pro- pelled by hydrogen microbubbles, generated from redox reaction between Zn and gastric acid, and then released from one end of the micromotors. They conducted the ﬁrst in vivo experiments of micro/nanomotors in the mouse model. Due to the high-speed motion of micromotors in gastric acid, the micromotors exhib- ited enhanced penetration and retention in the stomach wall for a long time (12 h) after oral administration. As the Zn dissolved, the drug loaded in the Zn layer was released into the stomach tis- sue, improving the delivery eﬃciency. Recently, Zhou et al. devel- oped a microrocket (MR) comprising a poly (aspartic acid) (PASP) tube, a Fe intermediate layer and a Zn core, with DOX bound to the surface through electrostatic interaction (Figure 7D). [101] Similarly, the microrockets were propelled by using gastric acid Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2020, 2001212 © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH2001212 (13 of 19) www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de as fuel. The presence of Fe component enabled microrocktes to be guided directionally by extra magnetic ﬁeld. Under the con- trol of magnetic ﬁeld, the microrocket could move toward gastric wall and insert into the gastric mucus gel layer for sustained drug release after orally administration. Furthermore, accurate positioning and prolonged retention in gastrointestinal tract for more precise therapy can be achieved by shielding the micro/nanomotors with enteric coating or encapsu- lating them in disintegrable capsules.[102] In the former study, Li et al. prepared enteric micromotors by inﬁltrating Mg microparti- cles into PEDOT/Au microtubes, then shielding the enteric coat- ing (Figure 7E). When the enteric coating was dissolved, the Mg particles were exposed to react with water and generated hydro- gen bubbles to power the micromotors. By adjusting the thick- ness of the enteric coating, the position, where the propulsion of micromotors were activated, could be preset, thus achieving site- speciﬁc gastrointestinal delivery. The latter study carried out by Wu et al. encapsulated Mg-based micromotors in enteric gelatin capsules to avoid reactions in gastric acid. Photoacoustic com- puted tomography, a high-resolution imaging technology, was adopted to monitor the navigation of micromotors in vivo. When the micromotor capsules reached the desired site, controlled re- lease and activation of micromotors were achieved by NIR light irradiation that can induce the photothermal eﬀect of Au compo- nents in micromotors and a gel–sol phase transition of the cap- sules. 4. Combination Therapy of Micro/Nanomotors Because of the numerous advantages of synthetic micro/ nanomotors for tumor targeting delivery, the micro/nanomotors have gained considerable interest for combination with other tu- mor therapies. The enhanced diﬀusion, precise control over mo- tion, and directionality of micro/nanomotors are all promising for improving the therapeutic eﬀect. For example, the design of micro/nanomotors can combine with photothermal therapy (PTT). Choi et al. designed temperature responsive stomatocyte nanomotors, whose motion could be controlled by NIR light (Figure 8A).[103] The nanomotors were prepared using PEG44- b-PS141 copolymers as blocks, PtNPs as catalytical engines, and naphthalocyanine (NC) as NIR light absorber. The on/oﬀ mo- tion of nanomotors could be controlled by NIR light according to the mechanism that the PEG in the copolymer is reversibly dehydrated above 55 °C, leading to the increased hydrophobic- ity of PEG44-b-PS141 chain. The increased hydrophobicity of PEG then induced the aggregation of nanomotors, which resulted in the cease of motion. After cooling, the nanomotors separated and recovered their motion. When illuminated by NIR light, the en- trapped NC absorbed NIR light and the membrane temperature increased, which realized the on/oﬀ control over motion and the eﬀective photothermal ablation of cancer cells. Additionally, be- cause the nanomotors were powered by Pt-catalyzed decompo- sition of H2O2, they can move directionally toward cancer cells that release H2O2 by chemotaxis, which may further improve the therapeutic eﬀect. Gold nanoparticles are widely utilized for PTT due to their capability to transfer heat to surrounding media under optical excitation.[104] And the motion of gold nanoparticles can fur- ther dissipate kinetic energy into heat upon collision with com- plicated surrounding medium.[100] Therefore, the motile mi- cro/nanomotors that contain gold component may bring supe- rior therapeutic eﬃcacy when used for PTT. Yang et al. demon- strated that NIR light propulsive Janus nanomotors have en- hanced photothermal therapeutic eﬃcacy of cancer in compar- ison to conventional photothermal nanoparticles (Figure 8B). [105] In this case, inorganic gold stars with NIR absorbance and or- ganic bis-pyrene nanoaggregates were chosen to construct Janus nanomotors as the hot parts and cold parts, respectively. The nanomotors were driven by the local temperature gradient be- tween the two sides of particles under NIR irradiation through thermophoresis mechanism. Compared with conventional gold nanoparticles, the Janus nanomotors displayed signiﬁcantly in- crease of local temperature and enhanced photothermal thera- peutic outcomes. The reason for this improvement was that ac- tive motion of nanomotors under NIR laser dissipated more ki- netic energy into heat than conventional gold nanoparticles that only have Brownian motion, which further increased the envi- ronmental temperatures. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another promising can- cer therapeutic strategy that attracts a lot of interest in re- cent years.[106] It can also beneﬁt from the combination of micro/nanomotors due to the multiple advantages of mi- cro/nanomotors mentioned above. Gao et al. proposed red blood cell-mimicking (RBCM) micromotors capable of actively deliver- ing oxygen and photosensitizers, indocyanine (ICG), to tumor for eﬀective PDT (Figure 8C).[107] The micromotors were fabri- cated by coating RBC-shaped hemoglobin particles that encapsu- lated Fe3O4 nanoparticles and ICG with RBC membranes. Due to the biconcave discoidal structures and the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the micromotors could be powered by acoustic ﬁeld and navigate to tumor site with magnetic guidance in the blood. The high oxygen aﬃnity of hemoglobin ensured the mi- cromotors to carry suﬃcient oxygen to cancer cells. Meanwhile, the RBC membrane-camouﬂaging protected the micromotors from biofouling and immune clearance, which facilitated their motion in whole blood. These characteristics together led to the enhanced PDT eﬃciency. Apart from providing adequate propulsion force, the driven process of micro/nanomotors can also have therapeutic ef- fects. You et al. constructed enzyme-powered nanomotors for enhanced synergetic PDT and starvation therapy (ST) (Fig- ure 8D). [108] The nanomotors were driven by the cascade reac- tion of glucose oxidase and catalase. At the same time, the en- zymatic reactions catalyzed by glucose oxidase consumed the intracellular glucose to starve cells and the decomposition of H2O2 catalyzed by catalase provided suﬃcient oxygen for eﬀec- tive PDT and sustained ST. This positive feedback between glu- cose oxidase and catalase, coupled with enhanced cellular up- take of nanomotors, greatly improved the synergetic eﬃcacy of PDT and ST. The study carried out by Uygun et al. found that the immobilization of enzyme on the surface of ultrasound- propelled nanowire motors could enhance the aﬃnity between enzyme and substrate (Figure 8E).[109] In this study, the immobi- lized asparaginase could eﬃciently knock down the asparagine in the bloodstream that is essential amino acid for malignant cells but not essential for normal cells, to kill leukemia can- cer cells speciﬁcally. Furthermore, the fast motion of the motors could facilitate the interaction between enzyme and cancer cells, Adv.

The responsive drug release mechanism has been extensively studied for drug delivery. [110] The loaded drugs can be speciﬁcally released in response to the predetermined stimuli like pH, re- dox, temperature, and the like. Some studies also coupled the mechanism with micro/nanomotors for better results. Tu et al. proposed a design of biodegradable stomatocyte nanomotors ca- pable of on-demand releasing drug in tumor cells (Figure 8F).[76] The stomatocyte nanomotors were made of two diﬀerent poly- mers, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) and PEG-b-PS. Due to diﬀerent properties of two polymers, the PCL could form domains on the polymersomes. The anticancer drug DOX was loaded in the lumen and the PtNPs were encapsu- lated in the cavity of stomatocyte as engine. As the nanomotors were taken up by cancer cells, the PCL domains degraded in the relatively acidic environment, which formed large pores and even collapsed structures on the stomatocytes, leading to the sustained Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2020, 2001212 © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH2001212 (15 of 19) www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de release of DOX in cells. They also prepared redox-sensitive stom- atocyte nanomotors by introducing disulﬁde linkage between PEG and PS. [69] The high level of glutathione in cells could dis- rupt the disulﬁde bond to cleave the outer PEG shell, leading to the aggregation of the exposed hydrophobic polystyrene parts and drug release. Llopis-Lorente et al. designed pH-responsive supramolecular nanovalves to gate the drug-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles for on-command intracellular drug deliv- ery (Figure 8G). [111] The nanovalves were acquired by the for- mation of inclusion complexes between cyclodextrin-modiﬁed urease and benzimidazole grafted on the surface of nanoparti- cles. Urease of the inclusion complexes also acted as engine to power nanomotors. At neutral pH, the pores were blocked by the nanovalves, inhibiting the release of loaded drugs. The drug re- lease was only triggered in lysosomal compartments of cells that had acidic pH by the protonation of benzimidazole groups and the disintegration of nanovalves. 5. Conclusions and Future Directions Micro/nanomotors have developed rapidly all these years, and present great prospect for tumor targeting with the unique ca- pability of energy conversion for autonomous motion. Apart from the applications described above, micro/nanomotors have extended their advantages toward other biomedical ﬁelds. Due to the facilitated autonomous movement, micro/nanomotors were endowed with the capacity to carry large mammalian cells, and the towing force was utilized to detect and isolate circulating tumor cells, providing a novel diagnosis method of tumor metastasis.[112] Moreover, the self-powered motion of micro/nanomotors was supposed to intensify chemical pro- cess with an increased opportunity of the contacts between reactants. And this characteristic was applied to the treat- ment of Alzheimer’s disease by enhancing the chemical pro- cess between amyloid-𝛽 protein and inhibitors immobilized on nanomotors.[113] In addition to the autonomous motion, the in- telligent micro/nanomotors with taxis facilitate themselves to deliver to areas that are not easy to target, such as throm- bus sites and stomach.[100,114] Despite great potentials of mi- cro/nanomotors, there are still many challenges in the future for biomedical applications. The ﬁrst challenge is the diﬃculty and complexity of syn- thesis. To break the Brownian motion, micro/nanomotors are usually designed with an asymmetric geometry, such as Janus nanoparticles,[90a] stomatocyte polymersomes,[103] multilayer- based rockets, [115] and tadpole-like nanomotors,[116] etc. All these structures need sophisticated and controllable technology, which is not suitable for the future clinical translation. Recent years, some studies have shown that nanoparticles with symmetric structures could also generate active motion, and what they have in common is that they are both driven by catalytic reactions.[27a,117] However, the exact mechanism for autonomous motion of these symmetric nanoparticles is not clear, some stud- ies attribute the locomotion to the asymmetric distribution of en- zymes around the micro/nanomotors,[118] and others hold the point that the movement is driven by expelling bubbles.[119] And the existing research studies are still very rare. It would be a re- markable progress, if the symmetric micro/nanomotors can be totally understood and applied to biomedical ﬁelds in the future. The second concern is the short lifetime. As summarized above, micro/nanomotors usually consist of metal materials, such as Mg, CaCO3, Zn, and Al. After fueled by hydrochloric acid or hydrogen peroxide, those metal-based micro/nanomotors gain autonomous movement by bubble recoil. However, with the production of H2 bubbles, there also accompanies with the rapid consumption of these metal materials. It remains to be inves- tigated whether the ﬁnite active metal materials could support micro/nanomotors to target sites. Moreover, there also comes with exhaust gas (such as H2,CO2) or waste (Al(OH)3,Mg(OH)3, ammonium), and when the internal fuel cannot meet the de- mand level, additional fuels, such as H2O2 is administrated to- gether with micro/nanomotors. Those exhaust gas, waste or even extra fuels are undoubtedly toxic to the human body and hinder the clinical translation. In the future development, mi- cro/nanomotors should focus more on the biological friendly fea- ture. Alternative fuels and zero-waste micro/nanomotors would gain much more preference. Though the locomotion of micro/nanomotors can be con- trolled remotely, most of the available studies are still based on in vitro experiments, while few are evaluated in animal mod- els. The tricky problem is the unanticipated complex biological environment and structure, such as insuﬃcient supply of fu- els, tortuous vessel system, biological barriers, and everchang- ing physiological conditions, etc. Those biological events make it more demanding for nanoparticles that can exhibit the same motion ability after in vivo administration. Moreover, for those micro/nanomotors that are controlled by external ﬁelds, what can be ensured is the successful delivery to target site while can- not guarantee the interaction between target cells. Take tumor site for example, besides tumor cells, there are other noncancer cells, such as T cells and macrophages that composed tumor site together. After self-propelling to tumor site, how to make mi- cro/nanomotor interact with tumor cells rather than stroma cells is an important focal point of future research. Also, as summa- rized above, the geometry structure of micro/nanomotors need to be carefully designed to break the symmetry, such as Janus, rod, and tube-based shape. However, the nonspherical are reported to be easily captured by MPS, [120] and are trapped in spleen at higher concentration rather than the target site. Micro/nanomotors that can escape the scavenging system and have long circulating time will gain more superiority in the future biomedical application. Taken together, although great progresses have been made in micro/nanomotors, the remarkable eﬀect have only shown in cel- lular level, while there is still a long way to go before applied in vivo. This review aims to give a summarized description of mi- cro/nanomotors as tumor drug delivery, and focus on the advan- tages during the process after systematic administration as well as the potential combination therapy. We look forward to the fur- ther development of micro/nanomotor in animal level and clini- cal cancer research in the future, which we believe would not take too long.
