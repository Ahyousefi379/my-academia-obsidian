Ram I. Mahato Preface The goal of our efforts in compiling Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutic is to produce a comprehensive, yet easy-to-follow review of the principles and current approaches in this ever growing field. With today’s broad research perspective and technology expertise, the knowledge in the field of cancer research and drug development has become a challenge not only for students who are eager to learn, but also for seasoned professionals who are willing to update. The complexity of cancer demands a comprehensive and integrated understanding from both cancer biology and pharmaceutical dosage forms and drug delivery, in order to warrant a successful therapeutic regimen. However, no book to date combines together these two aspects, namely the cancer research and the drug design and delivery from an integrated perspective of cancer treatment. Hence, a book that merges the knowledge from these two aspects is greatly desired. For the purpose of bridging basic research and clinical application, pharmaceutical drug development processes and regulatory issues, drug design and delivery, laboratory and translational experimentation, marketing and postmarketing surveillance, we have invited international experts with a multidisciplinary background, including scientists and clinicians from both academia and industries in their respective fields to contribute to this book. We intend to convey both an introductory understanding and the latest development in the field so that this book can be useful for both novice students and practicing scientists. With a comprehensive and integrated view of cancer therapeutics, we hope that this book will stimulate a deeper understanding and promote interaction in this integrated field for people with diverse expertise and backgrounds, who are working on cancer therapeutics. We have organized this book to cover a wide variety of topics, including strategies to suppress tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, overcome multidrug resistance in cancer, target telomerase and apoptosis pathways; therapeutic approaches to employ monoclonal antibody and cancer vaccines; introduction of new concepts such as cancer stem cells and new technologies such as nanobiotechnology, RNA interference, microRNA, and cancer cell gene profiling. The use of synthetic carriers, such as lipids, polymers, and peptides for delivery and targeting of small molecules, proteins, and nucleic vii acids to cancer cells or specific organs in vivo, as well as targeted delivery of macromolecular drugs to cancer cells, are described in detail. In addition, the utilization of imaging in cancer therapeutics, development and utilization of HIF-1 knockout animal models in cancer studies, as well as the principles of developing anticancer drugs and designing clinical trials, are also discussed. In summary, this book provides an in-depth review of various aspects of anticancer strategies and drug delivery approaches from different perspectives, including detailed discussion of several clinical trial cases. The book has a wider and more involved focus on cancer therapy with a good balance on diversity. It integrates cancer therapy approaches (both biological- and small compound molecule-based therapy) with drug delivery. By reading this book, not only bench scientists can have an insight for what physicians desire for their clinical use toward cancer treatment, but also physicians will better understand how the approach and drug are developed and therefore will apply the drug more efficiently and accurately in patients. Moreover, this book summarizes current progress and state of the art of cancer therapeutics, while focusing on the novel ideas that are being explored to overcome the existing challenges. We hope that this book will serve as both a refresher and ready reference, as well as an educational tool, to both new entrants and seasoned researchers. Memphis, Tennessee Yi Lu and Ram I.

Madu and Yi Lu 1 Introduction The growth of a tumor depends on both the tumor origin and the surrounding environment. Recent developments of therapeutic strategies targeting angio- genesis and other key steps in the metastatic cascade have demonstrated sig- nificant improvements on both the inhibition of primary tumor size and the suppression of malignant secondary tumor spreading. In this chapter, we briefly introduce tumor microvasculature and microenvironment, discuss tumor angiogenesis and therapeutic approaches for inhibiting of tumor angiogenesis, and examine the potential therapeutic targets for suppression of tumor progres- sion and metastasis. While this chapter focuses mainly on pharmaceutical approaches for targeting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, it also mentions other approaches including gene therapy. In addition, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are discussed. 2 Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 2.1 Tumor Microvasculature Cancer is a general term for malignant diseases characterized by uncontrolled and abnormal cell proliferation. Whereas different types of cancer have spe- cific causes that lead to the abnormality, all types of cancer require a suitable blood supply to facilitate the tumor growth. In a process termed angiogenesis, endothelial cells initially respond to changes in the local environment and migrate toward the growing tumor. The endothelial cells then migrate together forming tubular structures that are ultimately encapsulated by recruiting periendothelial support cells to establish a vascular network that provides Y.

This vascular network is tumor microvasculature. Solid tumors less than 1–2 mm in diameter in size generally can obtain their nutrition and oxygen needs through diffusion from the existing surrounding microvasculature [2–4]. However, a progressive enlargement of these tumors leads to an increase in demand for nutrients, oxygen, and growth factors, as well as the removal of increasing production of metabolic waste by the cancer cells. An insufficient supply of these requirements necessary for continuous prolif- eration results in regions of low glucose levels, low pH, low oxygen concentra- tion (hypoxia), and a possible shrinkage and death of these cells. In order to prevent these and prolong its survival, the tumors must develop their own blood supply network, the tumor microvasculature, in order to provide a stable flow of oxygen and nutrients as well as a system of removing waste to guarantee its unremitting growth. Thus, tumor vasculature has naturally emerged as a potential target for cancer therapy. 2.2 Tumor Microenvironment As the tumor grows, various cytokines and growth factors are released from the cancer cells into the surrounding. Consequently, various types of cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and infiltrating inflammatory cells are recruited to the tumor site where they are reprogrammed to perform new functions, further facilitating tumor growth. This process in turn creates an elevated variety of cytokines released into the local area by these cells. These various types of cells and cytokines at the tumor site together create a tumor microenvironment. Specifically, the tumor microenvironment is the stroma composed of various types of cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) that surround the tumor. The tumor microenvironment is a diverse and intricate surrounding that is characterized by low pH and nutrient levels, increased interstitial fluid pres- sure (IFP), and chronic variation of oxygen levels. The abnormality of tumor microenvironment induces alteration of gene expression in local cells. Those altered gene expression, either from the temporary genetic changes or from the buildup of genetic variation over time, provoke tumor cell ability to progression and metastasis. For example, the interaction between the tumor cells and the ECM, which is thought to play a major role in metastasis, can be modified by genetic changes induced by the local tumor environment. Several studies demonstrated that altered gene expression due to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) microenvironment contributes to the increased metastatic ability of tumor cells [5, 6]. Several genes whoseexpressions arealtered in thehypoxic environment have been linked to the steps of metastasis, including growth, angiogenesis, intravasation, extravasation, and survival [5–8]. By using a xenotransplant metastasis model of human melanoma cells, Xu et al. identified a ‘‘metastasis/aggressiveness gene expression signature,’’ based on 2 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu selection of metastatic potential [9]. Not only does this metastasis gene signature correlate well with the expression profile and the aggressiveness of disease from human melanoma patients but also many genes identified in the metastasis gene signature encode secreted and membrane proteins, suggesting the importance of tumor\u0002microenvironment interactions during metastasis. Genetic and molecular properties of the tumor cells have been the center of research for many years. The current focus has been gradually shifted to emphasize more on the interactions between the tumor and its microenviron- ment (or the ECM) and on the epigenetic and physiological regulation of metastasis [10]. The locally produced cytokines in the microenvironment, together with the immune responses generated, are considered as major factors in determining the progression or regression of a tumor. The pro- and antitumorigenic abilities of cytokines play essential roles in determining whether the tumor would grow or be rejected after the malignant cells interact with immune cells, which trigger further cascades of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. A recent review by Sheu et al. [11] has linked the microenvironment-derived cytokines and growth factors to a number of different kinds of human carcinogenesis models. Key factors that contribute to this tumor immune-altering ability include multi- functional cytokines, extracellular matrix mediators, and regulatory cytokines. Also, tumor cells are able to elude immune-system clearance due to the tumor’s ability of local immune suppression. Most tumors are immunogenic but often fail to simulate a sufficient immune response. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the ability of the tumor to escape from the host immune surveil- lance. The tumor microenvironment has recently been revealed as an important component contributing to the dysfunction of dendritic cells, which play a key role in the induction of tumor-specific immune responses [12]. Study has demonstrated that expression of immune-inhibitory B7 molecules was upregu- lated in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the immune evasion of tumors [13]. Thus, these inhibitory B7 molecules and their signaling pathways can be targets in new therapeutic approaches for cancer. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, whose progression from hyperplasia to malignancy and invasiveness is controlled by multiple mediators produced by the tumor and its stroma (tumor microenvironment), including, but are not limited to, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. The establish- ment of a tumor vasculature, viability, spreading, and eventual spreading of the tumor cells to secondary organs are all consequences of abnormal expression of these mediators. For example, clinical research indicates that poor patient prognosis in breast cancer is associated with the signaling activation of the ShcA, an adaptor protein that transmits extracellular signals (growth factor, one of such mediators) to downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases [14]. Depending on the microenvironment, tumor cells can either proceed further sequential steps toward malignant progression including initial recruitment of blood vessels or stay at a ‘‘tumor dormancy’’ state and fail to develop to a clinically detectable manifestation of cancer from a microscopic tumor due to Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 3 lack of angiogenesis [15]. Recent studies have showed that microenvironment stimuli, such as hyaluronan, have critical impact on cancer initiation and progression [16]. Because microenvironment plays such important roles in tumor initiation and progression, the tumor microenvironment including stro- mal elements has become an attractive therapeutic target for cancer therapy. 3 Angiogenesis 3.1 Physiological Angiogenesis Physiological angiogenesis occurs when new blood vessels arise from preexist- ing ones by emerging thin-walled endothelium-tubular structures in the pre- sence or absence of muscular smooth muscle wall and fibrocytes, respectively. It differs from arteriogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and usually takes place during a normal process, such as reproduction, growth and development (embryonic angiogenesis), and wound healing. Physiological angiogenesis is typically focal and self-limited in time [17]. In general, physiological angiogen- esis refers to the outgrowth of microvessels that are typically the size of capillary blood vessels in a normal process regulated by an array of balanced angiogenic stimulators (growth factors) and inhibitors. In a body’s natural process like wound healing, an injured tissue initiates the process of physiological angiogenesis by producing and releasing angiogenic growth factors into the wound area. Upon diffusing into the surrounding tissues, these angiogenic growth factors bind to particular receptors on the surface of endothelial cells of adjacent preexisting blood vessels, and consequently activate the endothelial cells. Specific signals are then transduced to the nucleus, which then instigates the production of new substances including enzymes to breakdown the basement membrane that covers the existing blood vessels. The endothelial cells start to proliferate and migrate out through the broken basement membrane of the existing vessels and are recruited toward the damaged tissue. A new blood vessel tube forms when numerous sprouting endothelial cells roll up. Many such individual blood vessel tubes eventually connect to one another, in order to form a new blood vessel network. The final stabilization of the newly formed blood vessel tubes is structurally supported by smooth muscle cells and pericytes [18]. As the vessel extends, the tissue around the vessel is simultaneously remodeled by collagen deposition from ECM and the local replacement of various cells. Once the wound healing process is complete, surplus cells are removed by apoptosis. 3.2 Pathological Angiogenesis Pathological angiogenesis occurs in both cancer and a variety of nonneoplastic diseases, sometimes collectively dubbed ‘‘angiogenesis-dependent diseases;’’ 4 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu These include, but are not limited to, diabetic blindness, age-related macular degeneration, and rheumatoid arthritis. These pathological conditions are characterized by the feeding of diseased tissues with new blood vessels and the destruction of normal tissues. In contrast to physiological angiogenesis, patho- logical angiogenesis can persist for years and is usually associated with some clinical symptoms. Pathological angiogenesis is an abnormal process of blood vessel formation in which the body loses control and becomes unable to provide a regulated, balanced array of angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors. As a consequence, angiogenesis-dependent diseases can result from either an exces- sive formation of new blood vessels (i.e., cancer) or an insufficient supply of new blood vessels (i.e., ischemia). Pathological angiogenesis can lead to various clinical symptoms such as bleeding, vascular leakage, and tissue destruction, and, in more severe states, incapacitation or death \u0002a consequence of angiogenesis-dependent diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis [17]. In cancer, diseased cells produce aber- rant high amounts of angiogenic growth factors, which overpower the regula- tory effects of natural angiogenesis inhibitors: consequently, new blood vessels grow rapidly in an uncontrolled manner, and excessive angiogenesis occurs. Pathological angiogenesis is essential for tumors to grow beyond a microscopic dimension size. The new blood vessels provide nutrition and oxygen to the growing tumor, allowing tumor cells to further proliferate and break into the circulation as well as spread to other organs (tumor metastases). 3.3 Angiogenic Switch Angiogenesis is driven by a delicate balance between different pro- and anti- angiogenesis effector molecules (or so-called angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors) that influence the growth rate of capillaries [19, 20]. The repre- sentative angiogenic stimulators include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFß1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and angiopoietin-1. The representative angiogenic inhibitors include thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), angiostatin, and endostatin. Normal vessel growth results from balanced and coordinated expression of these opposing factors. A switch from normal to uncontrolled vessel growth can occur by upregulating angiogenic stimulators or downregulating angiogenic inhibitors or a combination of the two [21]. The angiogenic switch, which leads endothelial cells from a quiescent state to active proliferation, occurs when the subtle balance between angiogenic stimu- lators and inhibitors is altered. While the exact mechanism of the angiogenic switch is still not fully understood, so far, four components have been proposed or identified to play roles in angiogenic switch in tumorigenesis, based on the studies. (1) Tumor angiogenesis driven by the prevascular tumors. The diffusion Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 5 limit determines the radius of a viable prevascular tumor by obtaining nutri- tion and oxygen from the nearby existing vessels; once beyond that tumor size (usually around 1–2 mm in diameter), the angiogenic switch must be turned on or the tumor undergoes apoptosis or necrosis [3, 4, 22–26]. Nearly 95% of the human cancers are carcinomas that start off as microscopic lesions localized in an epithelial layer devoid of blood vessels and separated by a basement membrane from underlying vasculature of local tissues. The basement mem- brane serves as a physical barrier to the migratory endothelial cells that are recruited to the tumor from the local neighborhood and form a circle of new microvessels around the tumor. After the rupture of basement membrane by sprouting new vessels, the infiltrated new capillary blood vessels are covered by several layers of tumor cells [27]. (2) Tumor angiogenesis contributed by circulating endothelial stem cells. Accumulated laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that circulating endothelial progenitor cells derived from stem cells in the postnatal bone marrow can contribute to tumor growth after they are recruited to the vascular bed of certain type of tumors [28–40]. Circulating VEGF may be one of the angiogenic stimulators by which tumors use to recruit circulating endothelial stem cells: VEGF\u0002VEGF receptor signal has been implicated in the mobilization of bone marrow progenitor endothe- lial cells into the circulation where the endothelial cells are further recruited into the tumor vascular bed [28]. Therefore, both the endothelial cells from the local neighborhood and the bone marrow can convene to the tumor vascular bed to serve as sources of microvascular endothelial cells for tumor angiogen- esis, although the ratio of the endothelial cells from these two sources varies for different types of tumors [41–43]. (3) Tumor angiogenesis contributed by nonendothelial cells. Besides endothelial cells, tumors may also recruit mast cells, macrophages, and inflammatory cells from the host [44–47]. These nonendothelial cells can release angiogenic stimulators (such as bFGF) and metalloproteinases, which breakdown the basement membrane and further facilitate the effects of angiogenic stimulators, leading to an in situ amplifica- tion of tumor angiogenesis [44, 48–50]. In addition, the host stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment can express an elevated level of VEGF to pro- mote amplification of the tumor angiogenesis [51]. (4) Angiogenic switch in secondary tumors. In the metastatic process, tumor cells migrate to the target organ and extravasate from the microvessels there. Once the secondary tumor starts to grow around these vessels, the original vessels degenerate due to apoptosis, and a neovascular network subsequently forms around the new tumor by its recruitment of neovascular sprouts from nearby existing vessels. This ‘‘vessel cooption’’ process may represent a transitional or alternative phase in the angiogenic switch [23, 52]. Because tumors are angiogenesis dependent, anti-angiogenic therapy that targets any of these components of the angiogenic switch should serve well for controlling tumor growth and metastasis. For example, circulating VEGF is one of the angiogenic signals by which tumors can recruit endothelial cells from the bone marrow [30, 53, 42, 54]. Therefore, angiogenesis inhibitors targeting 6 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu VEGF and other drugs that suppress the release of bone marrow-derived progenitor endothelial cells can be effective in blocking the angiogenic switch and tumor growth. 4 Therapeutic Approaches for Inhibition of Tumor Angiogenesis 4.1 From the Emerging Concept that Tumor Growth Is Angiogenesis-Dependent to Clinical Trials In early 1970s, Judah Folkman dared to propose a revolutionary concept that blood vessel formation around a tumor was a prerequisite for the growth of the tumor [3]. Best summarized by Folkman, ‘‘Once tumor take has occurred, every further increase in tumor cell population must be preceded by an increase in new capillaries that converge upon the tumor’’ [55]. Based on the observations by him and his colleagues in the 1960s that tumor growth in isolated and perfused organs was significantly constrained without vascular- ization [56, 57], Folkman hypothesized that tumor growth is angiogenesis- dependent and an anti-angiogenesis approach can be an effective therapy for cancer [3, 58, 59]. By the mid-1980s, a large amount of research data had been gathered in supporting and solidifying the concept that tumor growth is angiogenesis dependent. This concept and the subsequent evidences from biological, pharmacological, and genetic data have provided a scientific basis for the current development and clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors. However, it took many years before the discovery of the first angiogenesis inhibitor. Before 1980, doubts were casted over whether or not such sub- stances ever existed. The development of bioassays for angiogenesis during the 1970s aided in the discovery of angiogenesis inhibitors [60–64]. Incited by the premise that angiogenesis fosters tumor growth and driven by persisted efforts through a continued study over 25 years, the Folkman’s group finally identified the first angiogenesis inhibitor, interferon-alpha (IFN-a), in the early 1980s [65, 66] and several additional angiogenesis inhibitors lateron [67–71]. During the same period, more angiogenesis inhibitors were also discovered by several other groups [72–76]. The first clinical trial using angio- genesis inhibitor occurred in 1989 for the treatment of life-threatening heman- giomas (masses of blood capillaries) by IFN-a [77]. In 1992, TNP-470 became the first angiogenesis inhibitor entering clinical trial for cancer patients, and by the mid-1990s, several other anti-angiogenic drugs started entering clinical trials. By 2003, some of these drugs began to receive FDA approval in the United States. At the end of 2007, over 10 angiogenesis inhibitors had been approved by the FDA in the United States [17], and currently there are over 50 anti-angiogenesis-based drugs in clinical trials for cancer worldwide [77]. Among the 67 completed and ongoing/approved clinical trials in the United States which use anti-angiogenesis drugs, the majority (94%) are used Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 7 for cancer treatment [78]. Bevacizumab (Avastin), a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, came to US market in February 2008, becoming the first anti-angiogenic drug approved to treat breast cancer. 4.2 Category of Angiogenesis Inhibitors Angiogenesis inhibitors can be grouped by their natures, functions (Sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.2.3), or mechanisms of action (Section 4.2.4, 4.2.5, and 4.2.6). These classifications may overlap. 4.2.1 Direct Angiogenesis Inhibitors These inhibitors directly block vascular endothelial cells from responding to a wide spectrum of angiogenic stimulators, including VEGF, bFGF, PDGF, and others. As a result, the abilities of endothelial cells on proliferation, migration, and survival are suppressed, and angiogenesis is inhibited. This group of angiogenesis inhibitors includes low molecular weight compounds, such as thalidomide and angiostatic steroids; endogenous, naturally occurring proteins, including IFN-a, IL-12, TSP-1, angiostatin, and endostatin; synthetic inhibi- tors or peptides that are engineered to impede various steps in the angiogenic process, such as inhibitors of metalloproteinases. As demonstrated by animal study in which tumors growing in mice did not develop drug resistance after treatment with this group of inhibitors [79], direct angiogenesis inhibitors are generally less prone to stimulate acquired drug resistance in the host body, probably due to the fact that they target genetically stable endothelial cells rather than unstably mutating tumor cells [80]. 4.2.2 Indirect Angiogenesis Inhibitors Indirect angiogenesis inhibitors generally prevent the expression of or block the activity of a tumor protein that activates angiogenesis. The action is indirect \u0002 the effect of the inhibitor is on either blocking or reduction of the expression of an angiogenic product from a tumor, neutralizing the tumor protein itself, or occluding its receptor on endothelial cells. Many of these angiogenic products from the tumor are proteins coded by the oncogenes that promote the angio- genic switch [22, 81–83]. Studies demonstrated that transfection with oncogenes increases output of tumor cell pro-angiogenic factors and/or decreases expres- sion of anti-angiogenic regulators [83–86]. For example, overexpression of bcl-2 oncogene promotes prostate cancer cells to develop larger neovascularized tumors, increased VEGF expression and microvessel density [87]. The pro- angiogenic nature of these oncogenes may be a major component of their tumorigenic activity. Thus, drugs that target these oncogenes, their products, or the receptors of those products should have a two-fold inhibition on tumor 8 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu growth: one at disruption of angiogenesis as being an indirect angiogenesis inhibitor and another at anti-proliferation of tumor cells or promoting tumor cells’ susceptibility to apoptosis by anti-oncogene property. Several novel antic- ancer drugs have been developed based on their abilities to inhibit the activity of the oncogene or its mediated signal transduction involved in tumor angiogen- esis. Examples of this group of drugs include Herceptin, an inhibitor for the HER2 oncogene signal transduction [88], inhibitors of the EGF receptor tyr- osine kinase [82, 88, 89], and ras farnesyl transferase inhibitors that block ras signaling pathways which upregulate production of VEGF and downregulate production of TSP-1 [90]. 4.2.3 Endogenous Angiogenesis Inhibitors This group of inhibitors is defined as opposed to synthetic drugs or inhibitors purified from the bacterial organisms. The inhibitors of this group consist of endogenous and natural proteins that exhibit anti-angiogenic activities, including, but are not limited to, TSP-1, angiostatin, endostatin, interferons, tumstatin, arresten, canstatin, and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) [91]. The endogenous inhibitors can be either direct (endostatin) or indirect (PEDF) angiogenesis inhibitors. The interferons and platelet factor-4 were among the first in this group to be found possessing the abilities to inhibit endothelial cell migration [65, 92], proliferation [93], as well as angiogenesis [94, 95]. The discovery of the existence of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors has not only suggested the mechanisms for how a tumor may regulate its own growth but also provided us with new strategies to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and control tumor growth. The most known members of this group are endostatin and angiostatin, which have been shown to effectively suppress tumor angiogenesis in both preclinical and clinical studies [77, 96]. 4.2.4 Angiogenesis Inhibitors That Block the Signaling Transduction Pathway This group of inhibitors is categorized based on their abilities to block the angiogenic signaling transduction pathway and cascade. Some of them may overlap with the groups described above. Members of this group include anti- VEGF antibody that interferes with the binding between the VEGF receptor and its ligand VEGF, thus blocking the VEGF-mediated angiogenic transduc- tion signaling. Avastin, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, is the first of this kind of drug to be approved by the FDA; it has been shown to suppress tumor growth significantly and prolong patient survival in clinical trials [97]. IFN-a is another example of this group that inhibits the production of bFGF and VEGF, the angiogenic growth factors that initiate the angiogenic signaling cascade. In addition, several synthetic drugs that block receptors on endothelial cells are also in clinical trials [97]. Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 9 4.2.5 Angiogenesis Inhibitors That Prevent ECM Breakdown This group of inhibitors acts directly against angiogenic products generated by growing endothelial cells that facilitate ECM breakdown, specifically, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs play essential roles in angiogenesis by enabling endothelial cells to migrate into adjoining tissues through the holes of MMP-digested matrix and proliferate into the new blood vessels. Therefore, drugs that are aimed at MMPs can serve as effective angiogenesis inhibitors. Several clinical trials using synthetic or naturally occurring molecules that inactivate MMPs are currently ongoing [97]. 4.2.6 Miscellaneous Angiogenesis Inhibitors This is a group of drugs whose anti-angiogenesis mechanisms either are vague or do not fit in any group described above. Examples among this group are LBH589, a histone deacetylase inhibitor [98]; CAI, a drug that exerts its anti- endothelial cell growth effect by inhibiting cell’s calcium uptake [97]; rhodosto- min, a venom disintegrin that exhibits anti-angiogenic effects through blockade of avß3 integrin, has been reported to successfully suppress solid tumors and prolong survival in mice [99]; and other interesting pharmaceutical drugs that target annexin II [100]. In addition, the anti-angiogenesis drugs and strategies that have antioxidant effects or lead to copper deficiency for cancer chemopre- vention are also under investigation [101]. 4.3 Anti-angiogenic Therapy and Pharmaceutic Targets Anti-angiogenic therapy by the pharmaceutic approach refers to the applica- tion of particular compounds capable of inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels in the body, in order to fight ‘‘angiogenesis-dependent diseases,’’ includ- ing cancer. There are presently over 200 biotech, genomics, and pharmaceutical companies either investing in or developing new drugs to target the inhibition of angiogenesis [18]. The majority of these anti-angiogenic drugs that are currently in clinical trials target angiogenic growth factors or their receptors in order to block the angiogenic signaling pathway. A recent review by Folkman has provided a nice overview of the current anti-angiogenic drugs and their status of FDA approval and clinical trial phase [17]. In this chapter, we discuss several targets that can be used to inhibit tumor angiogenesis by pharmaceutical approaches. 4.3.1 VEGF as a Therapeutic Target Based on the hypothesis initially proposed by Dvorak that tumor angiogenesis is associated with increased microvascular permeability, a protein named as vascular permeability factor (VPF) was identified [102, 103]. The subsequent 10 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu sequence revealed that VPF is identical to VEGF, a protein independently found by another group and named for its ability to specifically induce angiogenesis [104–106]. VEGF/VPF (also named as VEGF-A later) is a dimeric glycoprotein secreted by cells that promotes tumor-associated angiogenesis [102, 104]. It is an endothelial cell mitogen and motogen [107–109]. The VEGF-A family comprises five isoforms, including polypeptides of 121, 145, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids that are produced by the alternate splicing of a single gene containing eight exons [105, 110–112]. VEGF165 is the one most commonly secreted by tumor cells as well as the one most influential in inducing endothelial cells to form new capil- laries [113, 114]. Besides VEGF-A, other identified VEGF family members that share structural homologues include VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF- E [109, 115]. In this chapter, we will focus on VEGF-A, the most common and well-studied member of the VEGF family. Signaling of VEGF is initiated via its binding to its receptor. Two high- affinity VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (Flt-1) [116, 117] and VEGFR2 (Flk-1/ KDR or Flk-1) [118, 119], have been identified in endothelial cells. VEGF receptors are tyrosine kinases that share with other growth factor receptors the ability to trans-phosphorylate and, in turn, phosphorylate on specific tyrosine residues of SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-containing signaling mole- cules [120, 121], thus activating kinase-dependent transcription factors known as STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins that are important modulators of cell growth responses induced by VEGF [122]. Studies have shown that it is Flk-1 (not Flt-1), undergoing strong ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation [120, 121], which plays the major role in mediating the mitogenic effect of VEGF in endothelial cells [112]. Several studies showed that VEGF and its cognate receptor Flk-1 play major roles in tumor angiogenesis [123–128]. The importance of VEGF signaling via VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGF R) in tumor angiogenesis is exemplified in several studies using a dominant-negative Flk-1 receptor [123, 129], neutralization of VEGF by mono- clonal antibodies (mAb) [130, 131], and neutralization of Flk-1 mAb [132, 133] or Flk-1 kinase inhibitors [134] all of which were shown to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth. Besides VEGF R1 and R2, a third VEGF receptor (VEGF R3 or Flt-4) was identified and is specifically expressed in lymphatic cells [135]. The various members of the VEGF family have overlapping abilities to interact with their receptors. For example, VEGF-A interacts with VEGF R1 and R2, but not R3; VEGF-B only interacts with R1; whereas VEGF-C and VEGF-D interact with both R2 and R3, but not R1 [136]. VEGF (VEGF-A) is the most potent angiogenic factor known and plays a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis [1, 137–140]. Several strategies have been developed to either directly neutralize VEGF or block VEGF signaling pathway in order to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. These strategies include neutralizing anti- body directly to VEGF [23, 141, 130], small interfering RNA [142, 143] or antisense oligonucleotide [78] to VEGF, antibody against VEGF receptor [132, 133, 144], or inhibitor of VEGF receptor kinase [145]. Avastin (Bevacizumab), an mAb directly against VEGF, was the first among those approved by the FDA in Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 11 2004 for the clinical trial of treating metastatic colorectal cancer [77]. In addition, downregulation of ligand VEGF gene expression [146] or the depletion of VEGF protein by truncated VEGF receptor [147] is also an effective strategy to inhibit VEGF-mediated tumor angiogenesis. 4.3.2 bFGF as a Therapeutic Target Another important angiogenic growth factor is basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which is the first angiogenic protein to be isolated and purified from a tumor [148]. bFGF stimulates cell proliferation on both endothelial cells and various stromal cells including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and neurons. bFGF also promotes endothelial cell migration. While there is very low expres- sion of bFGF receptors in endothelium and bFGF lacks a secretion signal sequence [149], bFGF has a high affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate which are abundant in extracellular matrix. Studies showed that bFGF inter- feres with and prevent adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium, suggesting that tumors may develop a local immunologic escape and tolerance by expressing high levels of bFGF [150–152]. bFGF has been implicated as a vital player in the early stages of tumor progression [153]. The elevated levels of bFGF are associated with advanced disease stages/tumor grades [154–156] and poor diagnosis in cancer patients [157]. Therefore, strategies by targeting bFGF have been developed in order to inhibit angiogenesis. When antibody against bFGF was administered into mice bearing tumors, dramatic reductions in both neovascularization and tumor size were observed [149]. Several substances have been discovered as potent inhibitors of bFGF. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides have been shown to inhibit bFGF from binding to endothelial cells [158]. Heparin oligosaccharides have been shown to inhibit bFGF-induced neovasculariza- tion [159]. Hyaluronan-binding protease, a plasma serine protease with a high affinity to glycosaminoglycans like heparin or hyaluronic acid, was reported to inhibit bFGF-dependent endothelial cell proliferation [160]. Of interest is that certain tumors, such as giant cell bone tumors and angioblastomas, express exclusively or mainly bFGF with no other usual angiogenic factors. When patients with these tumors were treated with interferon-a at low daily doses, bFGF production by tumor cells was inhibited [161, 162]. 4.3.3 HIF-1 as a Therapeutic Target One general characteristic of fast-growing solid tumors is the development of intratumoral hypoxia, whose existence correlates to a more malignant tumor phenotype and worse diagnosis. The tumor cells in hypoxic conditions are inclined to spread and develop multidrug resistance [163], both of which are obstacles in clinical interventions for cancer patients. The characteristics of a hypoxic environment include low oxygen tension, low extracellular pH, high IFP, glucose deficiency, and increased extracellular lactate levels. Adaptation to 12 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu the hypoxic environment is critical for tumor cells’ survival and growth. To prevent cellular damage and avoid cell death, the hypoxic cells in tumors must undergo modification of their gene expression profiles, in order to form new blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrition. These hypoxic adaptations include the stimulation of genes that control anaerobic metabolism, nitric oxide synthase, and angiogenesis process [44]. The main mediator of this hypoxia response/adaptation is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [164, 165]. HIF-1 is a transcriptional activator for a group of genes that are responsible for promoting tumor cell angiogenesis and progression [141]. HIF-1 is com- posed of an inducible subunit, HIF-1a and a constitutively expressed subunit, HIF-1ß [166]. HIF-1a is a protein of 120 kDa, member of the basic helix-loop- helix superfamily transcription factors, and its expression is very sensitive to oxygen concentration [167, 168]. Under normal oxygen tension, HIF-1a is rapidly degraded by a posttranslational ubiquitination-triggered proteolysis, and this degradation process requires von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein [169]. However, under low oxygen tensions (hypoxia), HIF-1a becomes stabilized and heterodimerizes with HIF-1ß to form the complex HIF-1, which mediates its nuclear translocation and binds to hypoxic responsive elements (HRE) within the promoter regions of target genes [164, 170]. Hypoxia in the tumor micro- environment is sufficient for activating HIF-1-dependent gene expression [171]. Tumor regional hypoxia and hypoglycaemia are the principal stimulators for the expression of local pro-angiogenic cytokines, especially VEGF [44, 167, 172]. A characteristic of cancer cells, the basal level of the HIF-1a subunit was frequently overexpressed in advanced tumors [173, 174]. HIF-1a is associated with the risk of aggressive behavior and tumor angiogenesis in gastrointestinal stromal tumors [175]. Overexpression of HIF-1a is also observed in many other cancers [176] and associated with increasing expression of VEGF [175]. Upre- gulation of HIF-1a signaling pathways has been associated with the molecular expression signature of micrometastasis in human breast cancer [174, 177]. HIF-1a is an important transcriptional factor for tumor progression and meta- static potential [178]: activation of HIF-1a stimulates a group of HIF-1a- regulated genes, including VEGF, one of its main downstream effectors that promote cell angiogenesis and tumorigenesis [179]. Many human neoplastic cells, including colon, breast, lung, endometrium gastric, bladder, and prostate, have been recently reported to overexpress HIF- 1 and VEGF transcripts. As VEGF is correlated to vascular density, malignant stage of the disease, and poor prognosis [180–184], targeting HIF-1 (the upstream regulator of VEGF) or its pathway has become a strategy for anti- angiogenic cancer therapy. For example, recent research has revealed that drugs capable of pharmacologically inhibiting estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), which interact physically with HIF-1 and are necessary for HIF-1-induced transcription, severely inhibited growth and angiogenesis of human breast tumor xenografts in vivo [185]. Other inhibitors for HIF-1 pathway include camptothecin/topotecan [186], PX-478 [187], YC-1 [188], and deguelin [189]. Some of these drugs are currently in clinical trials. Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 13 4.3.4 Other Targets for Angiogenesis Inhibition Epigenetic steps that stimulate a pro-angiogenic microenvironment for a tumor can also be targeted. One example of such targets is the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), known to upregulate VEGF expression and thereby promot- ing tumor angiogenesis. One recent study revealed that several bioactive food components are able to prevent tumor development by suppressing angiogen- esis via the iNOS-VEGF pathway [190]. Another recent study has demon- strated that PI3K/Akt pathway plays a significant role in controlling tumor angiogenesis and growth via modulation of HIF-1 and VEGF expression. As evidenced by the frequent mutations of PTEN and dysfunction of PI3K/AKT pathway in human cancer, the key components (PTEN and PI3K/AKT) in this pathway are suitable targets for cancer therapy [191]. Other anti-angiogenesis- based targets and approaches include utilization of natural and synthetic angiogenesis inhibitors such as angiostatin [192], endostatin [192], arresten [193], canstatin [194], and tumstatin [72]. 4.4 Gene Therapy and Other Biological Therapeutic Approaches for Anti-angiogenesis Inhibition of angiogenesis is an effective approach to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. Gene therapy has become the preferred alternative to warranting a continuous supply of an angiogenic inhibitor, due to its prolonged and wide dispensation of the inhibitor as a product of the transgene. Based on the gene delivery system, it can be categorized as nonviral gene therapy or viral gene therapy. The former uses cationic liposome, nanoparticles, and electroporation to deliver the therapeutic transgene, whereas the latter uses various engineered viral vectors including recombinant retroviruses, adenoviruses, and adeno- associated viruses to do so. The therapeutic transgenes include, but are not limited to, expression of angiogenesis inhibitors (such as angiostatin, see below), tumor/metastasis suppressor genes such as maspin [195, 196], and genes that disrupt angiogenic transduction pathway such as dormant negative VEGF receptor [197] or p16 that downregulates expression of angiogenic factors VEGF (see below). Because anti-angiogenic therapy works more effectively on prevent- ing tumor growth than causing regression of established tumors, gene therapy (especially the viral-based gene delivery) offers an ideal strategy for long-term, continuous production of anti-angiogenic agents that may best serve to prevent development of primary or recurrent tumors. With this notion in mind, gene therapy may be best used in conjunction with other standard therapeutic mod- alities such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. 4.4.1 Gene Therapy Using Angiostatin Expression of anti-angiogenic genes or angiogenesis inhibitors is a straightfor- ward targeting approach. Angiostatin gene therapy has been proven to 14 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu effectively suppress tumors and metastases in mice bearing different types of tumors including breast, renal, gliomas, melanoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, squa- mous cell carcinoma, and leukemia [198–210]. Angiostatin/endostatin released from stably lentiviral transduced bladder carcinoma cells inhibited prolifera- tion of the co-cultured endothelial cells [211]. Viral-mediated gene transfer of angiostatin has been tested in preclinical models for uveal melanomas [212] and ascite tumors [192], both demonstrate a therapeutic efficacy in terms of reduc- tion of tumor size, vascularity, and increase of animal survival. 4.4.2 Gene Therapy Target VEGF Because VEGF is the major player in tumor angiogenesis [1, 137–140], neutra- lizing or reducing the effect of VEGF, the ligand that initiates the VEGF- mediated signaling pathway, should effectively suppress tumor growth and metastasis. This goal can be achieved by either depleting functional VEGF protein or directly downregulating VEGF gene expression. Gene therapy- mediated expression of truncated VEGF R2 (flk-1), a competitive inhibitor for VEGF, suppresses neuroblastoma growth in vivo [147]. Viral-mediated expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 downregulates VEGF gene expression in glioma [213] and breast cancer cells [146]. Our group has generated a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus expressing human wild-type p16 under the control of a rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter (AdRSVp16) [214]; the inhibitory effects of AdRSVp16 on tumor angiogenesis were examined by both in vitro and in vivo methods using a breast cancer model. p16 Inhibits VEGF-Mediated Angiogenesis In Vitro To analyze whether p16 protein has an effect on VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, AdRSVp16 was used to transduce human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells; the conditioned medium was collected 72 h later and used for culturing human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC), cells on the matrigel in order to analyze p16’s effect on angiogenesis in vitro. HMEC cells were grown in the conditioned medium from untreated, control virus-treated, or AdRSVp16- treated MDA-MB-231 cells, and the status of the vascular tubular network formation on Matrigel, as an indicator of angiogenic ability of HMEC cells, was examined at 1 h, 6 h, 24 h, respectively. When the HMEC cells grew in conditioned medium isolated from the untreated MDA-MB-231 cells, the cells tended to form tubular structures very quickly on the Matrigel; even at 1 h, the cells started to aggregate together to form a pre-tubular structure (Fig. 1A). The apparent tubular structure was observed at 6 h (Fig. 1B), and the mature tubular network was attained at 24 h (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that there were some growth factors secreted from MDA-MB-231 cells that were able to stimulate angiogenesis of HMEC cells (Fig. 1A–C). In contrast, when HMEC cells grew in conditioned medium isolated from AdRSVp16-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, their abilities to form the tubular network were Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 15 significantly reduced (Fig. 1D–F). Even at 6 h and 24 h time points, where the untreated control groups formed a well-developed tubular network (Fig. 1B and C), the AdRSVp16-treated group had few, if any, visible tubular connec- tions (Fig. 1E and F). These results indicate that p16 effectively inhibited HMEC angiogenesis stimulated by growth factors secreted from MDA-MB- 231 cells. When HMEC cells grew in similar conditions as in Fig. 1A–C, but with added neutralizing antibody against VEGF, the cells’ abilities to form a tubular network were totally blocked (Fig. 1G), implying that it was VEGF, the downstream effector of HIF-1a-mediated transcription secreted from MDA- MB-231 cells, which played the major role in stimulating HMEC cell angiogen- esis. Moreover, this p16-mediated inhibition on the tubular structure was not due to the viral part of AdRSVp16, as the ability to form a tubular network of HMEC cells grown in conditioned medium from control virus (AdRSVlacZ)- treated MDA-MB-231 cells was not reduced, if not somehow increased (Fig. AAAA B C D EF G H Fig. 1 p16 inhibited HMEC tubular network formation cultured in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 cells. HMEC cells were planted onto Matrigel-coated wells in the conditioned medium derived from untreated (A, B, C) or AdRSVp16 transduced (D, E, F) MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. The development of the tubular network of HMEC cells was recorded at 1 h (A and D), 6 h (B and E), and 24 h (C and F) after HMEC cell seeding onto the Matrigel. As controls, the images of tubular network of HMEC cells grown in the same conditioned medium derived from untreated MDA-MB-231 cells but containing 1 mg/ml neutralized anti-VEGF antibody (G), and in the conditioned medium derived from control virus AdRSV- lacZ transduced MDA-MB-231 cells (H) were recorded at 24 h after seeding onto Matrigel 16 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu 1H). Taken together, these observations demonstrated that p16 inhibited angio- genesis in an in vitro angiogenic assay, as evidenced by its ability to prevent the formation of the tubular network in HMEC cells grown on Matrigel in condi- tioned medium derived from MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2). p16 InhibitsVEGF-Mediated Angiogenesis In Vivo To determine whether p16 inhibits tumor cell-induced angiogenesis, the effect of p16 on neovascularization of tumor surrounding cells was examined by dorsal air sac assay [215]. MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced with AdRSVp16. Forty-eight hours later the cells were harvested and injected into a chamber that was wrapped with a semipermeable membrane allowing for diffusion of growth factor, such as VEGF, but not cells. The chamber was implanted into a dorsal air sac in nude mice, and the newly formed blood vessels on the undersurface of the chamber were examined 3 days later. As shown in Fig. 3, PBS-treated mice (as a negative control) did not have any obvious neovascularization (Fig. 3A). However, the mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells developed tumor cell-induced neovascularization as evidenced by the newly formed ‘‘zigzagging-shape’’ small vessels in the air sac fascia (Fig. 3D). In contrast, mice with AdRSVp16-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells developed much less newly formed blood vessels (Fig. 3E and F), compared to mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells alone (Fig. 3D), or mice injected with control viral transduced MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B and C); both of the latter two induced a more extensive capillary network.

The number of tubular connections (i.e., crossing vessel points) was counted (five randomly selected fields at each time point), and the average crossing vessel points per field was presented for a quantitative comparison. The p values for differences between the control and AdRSVp16 group at 1, 6, and 24 h are all statistically significant (p<0.05). Some error bars are too small to show in this scale Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 17 MDA-MB-231 cells along with neutralized anti-VEGF antibody, this tumor- induced angiogenesis disappeared (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that breast cancer cells can induce neovascularization around the tumor by secreting VEGF to the surrounding environment, and p16 can inhibit this tumor cell-induced neovascularization. The advantage of using p16 gene therapy is two-fold: first, p16 inhibits tumor angiogenesis by downregulating VEGF gene expression; second, p16 itself is a cyclin D kinase inhibitor that suppresses cell division. Therefore, with the combination of p16’s effect on both anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferation, C FDB G A E Fig. 3 p16 inhibited tumor-induced neovessel formation in dorsal air sac model. The mouse in the dorsal air sac model [215] was sacrificed on day 3, after chamber implantation, and the implanted chamber was removed from the subcutaneous air fascia, a ring without filters was placed on the same site and then photographed. The newly formed blood vessels were morpho- logically distinguishable from the preexisting background vessels by their zigzagging characters (see representative arrows). Shown are undersurface images of sites from chambers containing PBS only as negative control (A), AdRSVlacZ-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells (B), MDA-MB- 231 cells (D), AdRSVp16-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells (E), and MDA-MB-231 cells with 1 mg/ml neutralized anti-VEGF antibody (G).

Lu p16 gene therapy should have significant therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer patients. 4.4.3 Other Targets and Protein Replacement Therapy for Anti-angiogenesis PI3K/AKT pathway regulates angiogenesis and several other cell functions including proliferation, transformation, and apoptosis. LY294002, an inhibi- tor of PI3K, is able to decrease PC-3 prostate cancer cell-induced angiogenesis [191], suggesting that inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may be an additional therapeutic approach to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. PTEN, a known inhibitor of PI3K, is frequently found to be mutated or lost in several cancers including prostate cancer. The recent study showed that angiogenesis and tumor growth can be inhibited by restoring wild-type PTEN in PC-3 prostate cancer cells [191]. Furthermore, ectopic PTEN suppressed HIF-1a, VEGF, and PCNA expression in the tumor xenografts. The similar experi- mental observations were obtained by ectopic expression of AKT-dominant negative mutant [191]. Together, these data suggest that gene therapy target- ing PI3K/PTEN/ARK may have efficacy against prostate cancer and other malignant diseases. In fact, a recent study of gene therapy using adenovirus- expressing PTEN effectively inhibited the angiogenesis and invasiveness of PC-3 cells [216]. While most studies on viral-based anti-angiogenesis cancer gene therapy remain in the preclinical stage, the recombinant proteins of some of these targets have entered clinical trials. Among them, angiostatin protein ther- apy has proved to be very effective when administered systemically to mice bearing a variety of tumors, where a synergistic effect on suppression of metastases has been observed, by combining with endostatin [209, 217, 218], interleukin-12 [219], or chemotherapeutic agents [220, 221]. Recom- binant IL-12 is in phase I/II clinical trial [222], and recombinant angios- tatin and endostatin have completed phase I/II clinical trials [77, 223], respectively. Endostatin and angiostatin have shown to stabilize the long- term disease and improved quality of life in a small group of patients, with a return of strength, weight, and hair growth \u0002 and virtually no toxicity [77]. Angiostatin replacement therapy prevented growth of lung metastases after regression of the primary tumor by radiotherapy [224]. A phase III trial of endostatin was conducted in China for nearly 500 patients with late-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Patients who had endostatin added to their chemotherapy regimen were reported to have increased time to disease progression [77]. In 2005, endostatin was approved for marketing in China. Therapeutic inhibition of vessel formation by gene therapy may be best suited in conjunction with other therapeutic modalities to prevent recurring tumors or micrometastases after surgical removal of primary tumor. Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 19 5 Tumor Progression, Metastasis, and Their Therapeutic Targets 5.1 Angiogenesis as the Prerequisite for Tumor Progression and Metastasis Progression from a neoplastic cell to a cancer involves the alteration of many regulatory pathways [225]. Tumors are made up of mixed-cell populations with substantial genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which are susceptible to continuous mutations and selections during expansion. During the selection process, some tumor cell populations are eliminated, some are enriched, and some newly mutated populations may rise. The selection can be based on the cells ability to invade and metastasize or on their proliferative advantage in certain or several microenvironments [226, 227]. Accompanying this selection is tumor progression. Metastasis, the spread of tumor cells from a primary site to the distant organs to form secondary tumors, is the optimal phase of tumor progression. Metastasis is the major cause of death in cancer patients [228]. Metastasis is a complex process including primary tumor growth, invasion through basement membrane and extracellular matrix, dissemination to lymphatic and/or blood circulation, migration to distant organs, vessel cooption, angiogenesis, and colonization in the secondary site [229]. In order to metastasize successfully, a tumor cell must pass through each of the following steps during a metastatic process: it must intravasate into the vasculature from the primary tumor, survive the circulation via blood or lymphatic vessels, reach the microvascula- ture of the distant organ and extravasate, develop the secondary tumor in situ, and induce angiogenesis in the target organ [230–236]. Involved in both the initiation and the completion of the metastatic cascade cycle, angiogenesis plays an essential role in metastasis. Two main steps in the metastatic process require angiogenesis: intravasation, the entrance of tumor cells into the blood circulation at the primary tumor site; and extravasation, the exit of tumor cells from the circulation and recoloniza- tion at the target organ. By responding to the angiogenic factors from the tumor, the proliferating endothelial cells build up a leaky capillary network around the tumor. Their fragmented basement membranes, due to the effect of tumor-recruited collagenases, allow the tumor cells to penetrate through the capillary and enter into the circulation [237–240]. Once the tumor cells reach the target organ, a reversed process occurs to enable the tumor cells to land successfully in a new environment. By modifying microvessels in the new surrounding such as enhancing vascular permeability and dilation, an angio- genic subpopulation of newly migrated tumor cells start a new cycle of angio- genesis by inducing new vascular sprouts in the secondary organ [241]. However, neovascularization of migrated tumor cells at the secondary site may not always occur immediately. Some metastases may stay in a dormant, undetectable stage for a very long time before angiogenesis occurs [242–244]. 20 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu Newly transformed neoplastic cells are not generally angiogenic. Angiogenic switch usually occurs during progressive stages of tumorigenesis, such as at the premalignant stage of a spontaneous tumor in transgenic mouse model [1, 245, 246]. Evidences suggest that most presenting patterns of the metastases may be determined by the intensity of angiogenesis in the vascular bed of the primary tumors [247]. For some human malignancy such as cervix cancer, angiogenesis may occur even before the preneoplastic phase, as supported by the evidence that the higher microvessel counts in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia correlates with the later advanced stage of lesions [248]. This explains why for some human tumors when their neovascularizations become detectable, metastases may have already occurred. For the majority of human primary tumors, how- ever, the angiogenic phenotype usually appears after the expression of the malignant phenotype [245]. The tumors can develop and stay locally without neovascularization for a long period before switching to an angiogenic pheno- type. For example, the prevascular tumors at the nonangiogenic stage that are found in several metastatic cancers are typically small and slowly growing lesions; they can be dormant for months, even years, without clinical symptoms, and they are rarely metastatic at that stage [248–251]. Likewise, in the animal models, the tumor cells are rarely shed into the circulation before a primary tumor is vascularized, but they do emerge in the circulation following neovas- cularization of the primary tumor. The number of cells shed from the primary tumor appears to correlate with the density of tumor blood vessels as well as with the number of lung metastases observed later [238, 252]. Therefore, angio- genesis is prerequisite for tumor progression and metastasis. Accordingly, it is rational and critical to intervene at the key step of the metastatic process, especially angiogenesis, for effective treatment. One of the most promising avenues of cancer research is the development of biologically based therapies to thwart the progression of metastatic disease. However, not all aspects of the metastatic process may be equally clinically applicable; thera- pies targeting angiogenesis and colonization that involve micrometastatic out- growth may be the most clinically applicable [229]. In order to recognize a tumor as a whole setting instead of tumor cells alone, therapies targeting components in the tumor environment (e.g., tumor vasculature, hypoxia, cell- ECM) have recently been increasingly developed. 5.2 Therapeutic Targets for Tumor Vasculature Angiogenesis, the formation of the new vascular network from preexisting vessels to supply the nutrition and oxygen to the growing tumor cells, is required for tumor expansion beyond 1–2 mm in diameter [3, 4, 22–26]. The same neovessel network may also function as a waste transportation pathway to remove the biological end products released from fast-growing tumor cells. It is in the tumor vasculature, the complex of tumor cells and surrounding Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 21 proliferating endothelial cells, where the individual tumor cell breaks away from an established solid tumor and enters the blood vessel circulation to initiate the metastatic process. There is now evidence to suggest that the blood vessels within a particular solid tumor may actually consist of both endothelial and tumor cells [253]. The mosaic vessels may account for the tumor-cell shedding into the vasculature. Consequently, the growth of resultant metastases requires a similar vascular network for supply of nutrition and oxygen for the growth of the primary tumor [254, 255]. Therefore, targeting tumor vasculature may be an effective approach in suppressing tumor progres- sion and metastasis. The tumor-associated blood vessels are distinguished different in structure from their normal counterparts of the adjacent tissue; instead of the character- ized dichotomous branching in normal vessels, the tumor-associated vessels are dilated, tortuous, often have multiple furcations, and heterogeneous in spatial distribution [59, 66, 146, 256, 257]. In addition, tumor-associated vessels are usually accompanied with a diminished expression of adhesion molecules that facilitate leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) and an increased expression of CD 44, a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions: overexpression of CD 44 has been linked to the growth and spread of a range of different types of malig- nancies [148, 258]. The considerably reduced recruitment of leukocytes and natural killer cells, due to decreased expression of adhesion molecules on tumor-associated endothelial cells, may contribute to the escape of tumor vasculature from immune surveillance [55, 258]; on the other hand, the enhanced expression of CD44 may provide growth advantage on the neoplastic cells [180]. Moreover, tumor-associated vessels differ from their normal coun- terparts in organization and function. Tumor-associated vessels are leaky, and the blood flow is not constant. Whereas the IFP in normal tissues is around 0 mm Hg [259], the IFP in solid tumors is elevated due to vascular hyperperme- ability and the lack of functional lymphatic vessels inside tumors. Throughout a tumor, the uniformly high IFP, which drops precipitously in the tumor margin [260], compromises the effective delivery of therapeutic drugs both across the blood vessel wall and interstitum inside tumors. Moreover, the increased fluid flow from the tumor margin into the peri-tumor area by the elevated tumor IFP may facilitate peri-tumor lymphatic hyperplasia and metastasis. In addition, the abnormal microcirculation in tumors, together with lack of oxygen and production of waste, creates ahypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironment which hinders the efficacy of several anticancer treatments, including radio- therapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, the disruption of tumor vasculature will not only destroy tumor cells directly but also help facilitate the drug delivery to the tumor and sensitize other anticancer modalities. In addition to destroying tumor vasculature directly, an emerging concept to treat cancer is ‘‘normalization’’ of tumor vasculature by restoring the angio- genic balance. As the imbalance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors contributes to the pathophysiological characteristics of the tumor, reestablishing the 22 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors in the tumors may promote tumor vascular normalization. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that nor- malization of tumor vasculature and microenvironment can be achieved, albeit transient, by anti-angiogenic treatments either targeting directly on angiogenic (such as VEGF-mediated) signaling pathway by VEGFR2 block- ade [261] or indirectly modulating angiogenesisby thalidomide [262]. A syner- gistic therapeutic effect was observed when cytotoxic therapy was combined with anti-angiogenic treatment during the latter induced ‘‘vascular normal- ization window,’’ when tumors are more susceptible to the chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy [257, 261, 262]. 5.3 Therapeutic Target for Tumor Microenvironment \u0002 Stroma A solid tumor, made up of neoplastic cells and nontransformed host stromal cells, is surrounded by ECM. Although not autonomous, the tumor acts as an organ-like entity with the aid of many interdependent cell types, of which the tumor is composed; these cell types contribute to tumor growth and progres- sion. The growth of the tumor and its potential to progress and metastasize is influenced by the tumor microenvironment, or stroma in a succinct term. Stroma consists of ECM, extracellular molecules and various cells including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, immunocytes, glial cells, inflammatory cells, as well as local and recruited endothelial cells. The tumor interacts with its ECM and stromain a dynamic and bidirectional man- ner. Not only do tumor cells rely on the stroma for proliferation, progression, and metastasis but also tumor cells evolve together with their stroma during tumorigenesis and progression. Examples of bidirectional relationship include the interactions between tumor cells and host endothelial cells, tumor vascula- ture and host immune cells, and tumor spreading to the regional lymph nodes and lymphangiogenesis. In addition, stromal cells can also affect organ-specific metastasis, as demonstrated by the role of stromal-derived cytokines and growth factors in bone-prone metastasis in certain cancers [263]. However, despite the knowledge of the importance of tumor\u0002stromal interactions in the tumor initiation and progression by the accumulated research evidences, the complex relationship between the tumor cells and the surrounding host cells is still not fully understood. In addition to their roles in all stages of the tumor progression, especially in the initial stage of tumor development, tumor microenvironment and stromal cells also contribute to the development of tumor drug resistance by altering drug metabolism and hindering drug delivery to the tumor. Recently, there has been increasing attention paid to target the tumor microenvironment, the critical stromal elements, as a cancer therapy approach. One such attempt is to develop drugs that induce apoptosis of stromal cells, disrupt the functions of the stromal cells, or inhibit the factors released by stroma that promote tumor Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 23 progression and metastasis. It has been shown that bone marrow stromal cells contribute not only to the development of drug resistance but also to the bone metastasis in patients with multiple myeloma. Targeting bone marrow stroma using a proteasome inhibitor leads to significant reduction of bone metastasis [263]. The additional advantage of targeting stroma is that stromal cells, due to their genetic stability, are less likely to develop drug resistance than tumor cells. Drugs targeting endothelial cells in stroma for anti-angiogenesis therapy such as Bevacizumab and Thalidomide have been developed and are currently in clinical trials [17, 263]. The tumor microenvironment and stroma cells can affect tumor progression either positively or negatively. Thus, the interactions between tumor cells and ECM, which can manipulate the malignant behavior of tumor cells in either way, are potential targets for the development of effective therapies. Based on the understanding that alterations in stroma and ECM can trigger and/or promote tumor growth and progression, it is feasible to design strategies that can prevent the tumor development or even revert malignant conversion by manipulating tumor\u0002stromal interactions and reestablishing normal regula- tion systems. Research work showed that numerous cell functions that are vital for the tumor progression, including growth, differentiation, survival, and migration, could be regulated through physical interactions between cell\u0002cell or cell\u0002ECM. Based on the premise that cancers can be induced by continuous modifications of ECM structure at an experimental system, as demonstrated by the fact that altering mechanical force balance in the ECM, cell and cytoskeletal can induce epithelial tumor progression in vitro [264]. It is reasonable to speculate whether or not cancer can also be reverted to ‘‘normal’’ tissues by remodeling the tumor microenvironment. For instance, certain epithelial cancers can be induced to regain normal tissue morphology after stimulation from the embryonic mesenchyme or exogenous ECM scaffolds, a product derived from epithelial\u0002stromal interactions [264]. The optimal goals of these approaches are to suppress or eradicate tumor metastasis and transform the malignant cancer into a chronic, not life-threatening disease. A better knowl- edge about the tumor microenvironment would help in developing improved drugs and anticancer strategies. 5.4 Therapeutic Target for Hypoxia and HIF-1 Tumor hypoxia results from a disparity between the demand and the supply of oxygen to the tumor tissue; this consequence occurs when tumor cells are too distant from the vascular supply. By overcoming the hostile hypoxic environ- ment, a tumor induces a new vascular supply to provide oxygen and nutrition \u0002 a process called angiogenesis. Accumulated evidences indicate that tumor hypoxia plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis [5–8]. Studies both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that hypoxic exposure of 24 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu tumor cells enhances their metastatic ability [265–269]. Although the mechan- ism by which hypoxia amplifies the metastatic potential is not fully under- stood, it is likely that expression of a set of genes, which control processes involved in the metastatic cascade, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, survi- val, migration, and invasion, is affected by hypoxia. The most and well- studied hypoxia-responsive gene is HIF-1a, which is promptly degraded by proteasomal ubiquitination under normoxic conditions but is stabilized under hypoxic conditions [270]. HIF-1a binds to HIF-1ß, a constitutively repressed subunit [166, 271] to form HIF-1, which acts as a master regulator at the transcription level [164]. HIF-1 drives expression of multiple genes involved in the metastatic process, including the key pro-angiogenic VEGF gene [272], and thus promotes angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis. High levels of HIF-1a have been consistently correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several types of cancers [273], and HIF genes (including HIF-1 and HIF-2) are found to be often upregulated in cancer and their metastases, suggesting that transcription of HIF downstream target genes can promote growth and survival of tumor cells [179]. As interlinked incidents during the process of angiogenesis, the formation of neovasculature is inherently associated with and promoted by the development of tumor hypoxia. Hypoxia is also suggested to affect expression of genes associated with cell\u0002cell and cell\u0002ECM interactions, favoring a metastatic profile by upregulating expression of pro-angiogenic factors and MMPs, as well as downregulating E-cadherin and TIMP1 expression [10]. Furthermore, the tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a poor prognosis have been associated with hypoxia and high levels of HIF-1a in solid tumor tissues [274]. Therefore, therapies against hypoxia or inhibition of HIF-1 activ- ity may serve as an important component in combination anti-angiogenesis therapies. Flavones extracted from Portulaca oleracea are found to have anti- hypoxia effects in the animal study [275]. The anti-angiogenic effects of several novel therapeutic agents that target signal-transduction pathways appear in part due to their ability to reduce HIF-1a levels. Small-molecule inhibitors of HIF-1a are being screened and tested for their efficacy as anticancer agents [164, 276, 277]. Cetuximab, a drug that blocks activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, decreases HIF-1a protein synthesis through the inhibi- tion of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway [278]. 5.5 Therapeutic Target for Cancer Stem Cells Tumors consist of heterogeneous populations of cancer cells that constantly divide and grow at a furious pace. The subpopulations of cancer, arisen from rapidly accrued mutations within a tumor, may contribute to the development of drug resistance and thus escape therapy. Other proposed mechanisms respon- sible for the therapeutic resistance include increased Wnt/beta-catenin and Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 25 Notch signaling, amplified checkpoint activation, and upregulated DNA damage repair [279]. Recent work suggests that the cancer stem cells (CSC), a small population of tumor-initiating and self-renewed cancer cells, also contri- bute to the tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (see Chapter 17 Section 4 for more details). In addition, CSC appears to play a role in angiogen- esis; accumulated research work has suggested that CSC is a subpopulation of tumor cells that have metastatic ability [280–282]. Accordingly, therapies target- ing molecular mechanisms responsible for CSC-mediated resistance are inte- grated in the treatment paradigm by anti-angiogenic agents, in order to improve the efficacy of current anti-angiogenesis cancer therapies (for more detailed therapeutical strategies targeting CSC, see Chapter 17). 6 Challenges and Future Prospects 6.1 Unsolved Problems 6.1.1 Resistance to Anti-angiogenesis Therapy Anti-angiogenic therapy, focused on inhibiting new blood vessel formation, is an effective way to suppress tumor progression. However, one major challenge of this approach is that tumors adapt to and escape from anti-angiogenic therapy. Many angiogenic inhibitors that have been shown to successfully inhibit tumor growth in preclinical models display very poor efficacy on clinical trials [283]. The tumor microenvironment, which modulates the sensitivity of tumors to an anti-angiogenic drug, may be partially responsible for this dis- crepancy. Even for those anti-angiogenic drugs that show an initial response, the patients may eventually display progression of cancer, indicating that tumors may have developed resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs [284, 285]. In contrast to our great advances in knowledge of the mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis, development of new anti-angiogenic drugs and clinical applica- tions of anti-angiogenic therapies, our current understanding about the process of tumor adaptation to, or mechanism of tumor escape from, angiogenesis inhibition is limited [286]. Accumulated data have started to show that tumors can upregulate angiogenic factors, which mobilize and recruit bone-marrow- derived epithelial cells as well as promote endothelial proliferation in situ as an adaptation/reaction to the anti-angiogenic therapy [22, 287, 288]. Recent stu- dies suggest that CSC and the stromal context may also play important roles in tumor’s adaption to anti-angiogenic therapy [280]. Despite our comprehensive understanding on the factors and mechanisms involved in angiogenesis that enable us to develop a variety of angiogenic inhibitors, little is known on the alterations of angiogenic mechanisms under treatment of anti-angiogenic drugs in human cancer. Because of this, investiga- tions are primarily confined to understanding the roles of individual molecules or pathways, instead of providing an integrated view. With the help from 26 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu analyzing and understanding the functional association between apparently distinct events during angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis therapy, as well as the identification of the molecular or metabolic features which render tumor cell resistance or sensitivity to anti-angiogenesis therapy, it is possible to design more effective drugs and strategies from an integrated perspective to overcome the tumor resistance to therapy. 6.1.2 Toxicity Associated with Anti-angiogenic Drugs An obvious side effect of anti-angiogenic therapy is the toxicity to the host body in a long-term treatment, which is usually needed for anti-angiogenic therapy. It not only affects the body’s normal process ability such as physiological angio- genesis for wound healing or reproduction but also leads to potential risks like bleeding or clotting disorders and cardiovascular defects [289]. To make mat- ters worse, the toxicity to the host associated with long-term therapy by anti- angiogenic drugs may be delayed and thus hard to detect at the time of drug administration [290]. Despite the fact that therapies aiming at pro-angiogenic growth factors are generally more effective, the direct suppression of the neo- vascularization by targeting endothelial cells appears to have benefits of reduced toxicity and drug-induced resistance [291]. Therefore, selective target- ing on the tumor vasculature, especially selective targeting of pathological endothelial cells, has become an important direction in developing the next generation of anti-angiogenic drugs, which are able to specifically block tumor angiogenesis without affecting other physiological angiogenesis process. Recent development of a peptide that binds to specific markers of tumor vasculature and optimization of liposome-based delivery by coupling the peptide with various liposomes conjugated with a chemotherapeutic agent [292–294] may hold hope to the next generation of tumor vasculature-targeting therapeutic agents. In addition, photosensitizers specifically targeting tumor stroma in photodynamic therapy may also help to reach that goal [295]. 6.1.3 Lack of Appropriate Animal Models There are numerous cases in which an anti-angiogenic drug that works very effectively in the animal model fails to deliver the same therapeutic effect in the clinical trial [283]. Multiple factors could be counted for this discrepancy, including the tumor microenvironment’s effect on drug sensitivity and tumor adaptation to the drug; the choice of an animal model may be another major cause on the overestimation of the anticancer effect of an anti-angiogenic drug. Due to a very limited number of animal models available that generate clinically relevant, spontaneous tumors, and metastases, most preclinical studies have been done on transplantable tumors (either human tumor xeno- grafts or mouse tumor allografts) that usually grow rapidly as solid, localized tumors in the subcutaneous space. The experimental situation renders the evaluation of drug’s anti-angiogenic effects to be mainly focused on the newly Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 27 formed immature vessels due to rapidly growing nature of the transplantable tumor models; these effects do not necessarily reflect the actual clinical situation. Most of the human solid tumors take a much longer time to develop than mouse transplantable tumors; hence, the human tumors are accompanied by a larger proportion of mature vessels in the tumor mass and therefore become less responsive to anti-angiogenic drugs, which usually work most effectively on newly formed vessels. This may explain why human tumors have a reduced response to the anti-angiogenic drugs than transplantable mouse tumors do. Moreover, those evaluations on the trans- planted tumors overlook or are incapable of examining the drug’s effects on the distant visceral metastases, the secondary tumors which are the actual cause of cancer deaths. Therefore, clinically relevant animal models which form spontaneous tumors, or orthotopically transplanted tumors which are able to develop secondary lesions by their natural metastatic routes, will be more desirable for preclinical evaluation of anticancer effects of a drug on both primary tumors and metastases. Besides the above three issues, other remaining obstacles to anti-angiogenic therapy for cancer include high tumor IFP-impaired transport of drugs and vasculogenic mimicry in solid tumors; both are either component of or part of the process in microenvironment and tumor vasculature. Therefore, strategies targeting tumor vasculature and microenvironment have a great potential in developing more effective, new age anticancer drugs. 6.2 Future Directions The success in cancer therapy, especially on inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis through targets in tumor microvascular and environment, will rely on the advances on several aspects: further understanding of the biology of malignant tumors and elucidation of mechanisms of pathways that are critical for tumor progression and metastasis, especially on the roles of stroma and CSC in tumor development and malignant progression; identification of the new therapeutic targets and invention of the new gen- eration drugs that are more efficacious and less toxic; exploration and validation of more reliable biomarkers and improvement of imaging tech- nology to better monitor tumor development and evaluation of drugs; and more efficient and beneficial translation of basic research findings into clinical applications. The advance of research tools, such as 3-D culture technology and clinically relevant disease animal models, will greatly facil- itate and have significant impacts on laboratory scientists’ ability to design and develop better drugs, investigate the mechanism of a drug, and study its effect on tumors as well as on interaction between tumor cell and the micro- environment. Future directions in this field should include, but are not limited to, the following areas. 28 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu 6.2.1 Establishment of Reliable Biomarkers Presently, there are at least ten anti-angiogenic therapy-based drugs cur- rently in clinical trials [17]. The biomarkers of angiogenesis are critical in evaluating the efficacy of a new drug and developing an anti-angiogenic therapy. In early clinical studies, the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs observed were important in confirming drug activities. In the long term, however, biomarkers are more desired for the successful evaluation of new drugs and the improved clinical use of FDA-approved drugs, as both evalua- tions rely heavily on the close surveillance of angiogenesis status and drug activity in patients. Unfortunately, there is no validated biomarker available to date of either angiogenesis or anti-angiogenesis for routine clinical use [296]. The search for biomarkers of angiogenesis and, especially, of clinically successful anti-angiogenic therapy, has therefore become a major challenge in translational and clinical cancer research. 6.2.2 Target Stroma and Cancer Stem Cells The better understanding of the roles that stroma microenvironment and cancer stem cells (CSC) play in tumor progression and metastasis would facilitate the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer, as well as translate this information into useful clinical applications. For example, identification of the alterations of the components in the stroma during carcinogenesis would help develop strategies and drugs targeting the stro- mal cells or specific factors produced by stromal cells that are required for tumor development, progression, and site-specific metastasis. Further characterization of CSC and understanding their roles as well as their interaction with stromal cells in the metastaticprocess would lead to the development of better strategies to identify and eliminate CSC and suppress metastasis. 6.2.3 Combination Therapy Anti-angiogenic therapy appears toworkatmuchhigherefficacy when combined with chemotherapy. Recent clinical trials have revealed that the anti-VEGF mAb Bevacizumab adds to the effect of chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer [297]. Other anti- angiogenic therapies that inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase or combi- natively inhibit VEGF and EGF receptors have also been tested in conjunction with chemotherapy [297]. Besides chemotherapy, other therapeutic modalities including gene therapy, immunologic therapy, and radiation therapy, can also be used in conjunction with anti-angiogenic therapy to improve the anticancer therapeutic index. Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 29 6.2.4 Novel Therapies Anti-neovascular Therapy Partially due to a lack of specific tumor-endothelial markers, the conventional anti-angiogenic inhibitors are designed to target new vessels instead of exist- ing tumor vessels, that is, to inhibit further formation of neovessels rather than to disrupt newly formed angiogenic vessels. As a consequence, tumor growth is stopped but the tumor cells may not be eradicated, so this strategy is essentially a tumor dormancy therapy. In contrast, a novel concept of anti- angiogenic therapy is applying cytotoxic drugs to target and destroy angio- genic, rapid-growing endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature. This is called anti-neovascular therapy (ANET), in which the cytotoxic drugs are efficiently delivered to the neovessels in order to successfully damage the EC cells, thereby possibly leading to a complete cut-off of vital supplies to the tumors. As this strategy causes strong cytotoxicity to the tumor vasculature rather than cytostasis to the tumor alone [298, 299], ANET may eradicate primary tumors and suppress metastasis. With the help of drug delivery system tech- nology and development of angiogenic vasculature-targeting probes, ANET is being tested to deliver the cytotoxic anticancer agents to the angiogenic EC of tumor vasculature [300–302]. ANET may also provide improved therapeu- tic index when combined with conventional anti-angiogenic therapy. Targeting Key Transduction Pathway Kinase The prognosis of cancer patients with metastases remains poor due to the fact that current therapeutic strategies, including some new chemotherapeutic treat- ment, fail to significantly improve survival. In order to identify the novel therapeutic targets for more effective treatment, some attention has been focused on the better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways that contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. For example, new treatment approaches utilizing drugs that specifically target kinase transduction pathways involved in tumor growth have shown some promise either as individual agents or as conjugates combined with conven- tional chemotherapy [303]. Cancer ‘‘Normalization’’ An intriguing view in the current field of cancer research is to question the possibility of whether remodeling the tumor microenvironment can reverse the cancer. Based on the hypothesis that cancer is probably a reversible disease, which is a consequence from progressive deregulation of tissue architecture to physical changes in cells, altered mechanical signaling, and eventually to cancer [264], it is possible to ‘‘normalize’’ the cancer by developing a tissue engineering approach in which biologically inspired materials that mimic the embryonic microenvironment can be used to induce and convert cancers into normal tissues. 30 C.O. Madu and Y. Lu Discovery of New Drugs by Chemical Genomics The application of a novel chemical genomics approach on angiogenesis study has led to the discovery of new small molecules and novel targets in angiogenic therapy [304]. Taking advantage of being an inter- and multidisciplinary research engine, chemical genomics utilizes small molecules to dissect the roles of genes and facilitate the discovery of new drugs that are capable of inhibiting angiogenesis. With the help of specific molecular recognition of small molecules with target protein, the mechanism of actions of small molecules may be elucidated; hence, a better drug can be designed based on the structure and activity.

Tumor Microvasculature and Microenvironment 47 Anticancer Drug Development Unique Aspects of Pharmaceutical Development Ajit S. Narang and Divyakant S. Desai 1 Introduction Around the world, tremendous resources are being invested in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Europe and North America. Discovery and development of anticancer agents are the key focus of several pharmaceutical companies as well as non- profit government and non-government organizations, like the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the United States, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), and the British Cancer Research Campaign (CRC). Identification of cytotoxic compounds led the development of anticancer therapeutics for several decades. Advances in cancer treatment, however, contin- ued to be limited by the identification of unique biochemical aspects of malig- nancies that could be exploited to selectively target tumor cells. Schwartsmann et al. noted in 1988 that of over 600,000 compounds screened by then, less than 40 agents were routinely used in the clinic [1]. The recent growth in molecular sciences and the advances in genomics and proteomics have generated several potential new drug targets, leading to changes in the paradigms of anticancer drug discovery toward molecularly targeted therapeutics. These shifting paradigms have not only resulted in the greater involvement of biological scientists in the drug discovery process but also required changes in the screening and clinical evaluation of drug candidates. Both small and large molecular compounds con- tinue to be investigated as anticancer agents. The discovery and development of anticancer drugs, especially cytotoxic agents, differ significantly from the drug development process for any other indication. The unique challenges and opportunities in working with these agents are reflected in each stage of the drug development process. This chapter will highlight the unique aspects of anticancer drug discovery and development. A.S. Narang (*) Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co., New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA e-mail: ajit.narang@bms.com Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_2, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 49 2 Approaches in Anticancer Drug Therapy Conventional anticancer drug discovery and development have focused on the cytotoxic agents. The drug discovery paradigms selected agents that had sig- nificant cytostatic or cytotoxic activity on tumor cell lines and caused tumor regression in murine tumor allografts or xenografts. The anticancer agents were discovered mainly by serendipity or inhibiting metabolic pathways crucial to cell division. Their exact mechanisms of action were often a subject of retro- spective investigation. For example, Farber et al. reported the use of folate analogues for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 1948 [2], while its mechanism of action, inhibition of the dihydrofolate reductase, was reported by Osborn et al. in 1958 [3, 4]. Similarly, the nitrogen mustard, mustine, was used as a chemotherapeutic agent long before its mechanism of action was understood [5]. Although this strategy has achieved significant success, the recent develop- ments in molecular biology and an understanding of the pharmacology of cancer at a molecular level have challenged researchers to come up with target-based drugs. These are the agents that are pre-designed to inhibit and/or modify a selected molecular marker deemed important in cancer prognosis, growth, and/ or metastasis. Several target-based compounds have emerged in recent years. While most of these compounds are in preclinical testing, several are in clinical trials and a few have been approved in the United States. For example [6], \u0002 Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec1, Novartis) is a small-molecule compound that inhibits a specific tyrosine kinase enzyme, the Bcr–Abl fusion oncoprotein. It is used for gastrointestinal stromal tumor and chronic myeloid leukemia. \u0002 Gefitinib (Iressa1, AstraZeneca & Teva) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor’s (EGFR, or erbB1) tyrosine kinase domain. It is used for non-small-cell lung cancer. \u0002 Bortezomib (Velcade1, Millenium Pharmaceuticals) is a small-molecule proteasome inhibitor used for the treatment of multiple myeloma refractory to other treatments. \u0002 Rituximab (Rituxan 1, Biogen Idec & Genentech) is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and B-cell leukemia. It binds the CD20 antigen on the CD20+ B-cells, causing their apoptosis. \u0002 Trastuzumab (Herceptin1, Genentech) is a monoclonal antibody that binds the cell surface HER2/neu (erbB2) receptor and is used in the therapy of erbB2+ breast cancer. 2.1 Drug Development Paradigms for Molecularly Targeted Agents Conventional screening models for anticancer agents are geared toward the selection of cytotoxic drugs. The animal screening models predominantly focus 50 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai on tumor regression and survival advantage, while the early stage human clinical trials are aimed at determining the limiting dose where high drug- related toxicity is observed. Toxicity and tumor-regression effects of cytotoxic agents are based on the same mechanism (Fig. 1A). Thus, these agents are dosed to the allowable maximum levels where serious toxicity is not observed. The molecularly targeted agents, on the other hand, act by mechanisms that may not result in direct and significant toxicity. These agents act on the extra cellular, transmembrane, or nonnuclear intracellular processes and are exem- plified by receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, and angiogenesis inhibitors. For example, compounds such as 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) target developing tumor vasculature and have proven useful in cancer treatment when combined with conventional cytotoxic agents [7]. These agents often cause tumor growth inhibition, rather than regression, in animal models. They have better toxicity profiles than cytotoxic drugs and require prolonged administration [8]. The differences between their dose– response and dose–toxicity curves are illustrated in Fig. 1B. The discovery and development of molecularly targeted anticancer agents necessitate changes in the anticancer drug preclinical and clinical screening paradigms not only because of the differences in their dose–response and dose–toxicity profiles and mechanisms but also because these agents are dis- covered with a pre-targeted mechanism of action. Although the development of the molecularly targeted agents is far more complex and demanding, they are being actively pursued with over 1,300 small biotech companies in the United States focusing on molecular targets, of which over half are focusing on cancer MTD DoseEffect/Toxicity Effect Toxicity MTD DoseEffect/Toxicity Toxicity (I) Toxicity (II) Effect A, Cytotoxic agents B, Non-cytotoxic, molecularly targeted agents Fig. 1 Hypothetical dose–effect and dose–toxicity curves for cytotoxic (A) and non-cytotoxic, molecularly targeted anticancer agents (B). The cytotoxic agents are known for their dose- dependent toxicity, which closely follows the dose–effect curve. Non-cytotoxic agents, on the other hand, could have a linear dose–toxicity relationship similar to the cytotoxic agents (I) or a non-linear profile with dose–toxicity curve lower than the dose–effect curve (II). MTD repre- sents the maximum tolerated dose for the cytotoxic agent. Modified from Hoekstra et al. [8] Anticancer Drug Development 51 treatment. There are estimated at least 395 agents in clinical trials for cancer treatment, more than in any other therapeutic class of medicine [9]. An important element of preclinical and clinical screening of molecularly targeted agents is the investigation of their effects on the specific molecular targets. Even though the drug effects on its molecular target may not be sufficient to demonstrate clinical benefit, it is necessary to validate this model of drug development and to understand the mechanism of drug action. Further- more, it may be useful as a surrogate marker to guide dose escalation studies in early stage human clinical development. Evaluation of target effects in clinical trials, however, is not trivial. This requires the development and validation of a target specific molecular assay, and the correlation of the molecular target to the tumor type. Furthermore, physiological levels of molecular markers could have high natural variations, leading to difficulty in proving statistically sig- nificant drug effects. Most molecularly targeted agents, however, do not proceed to advanced stages in human clinical trials due to either efficacy or toxicity concerns. The toxicity profile of an agent includes general toxicity and effects explained by its mechanism of action. While the toxicity remains largely unpredictable and difficult to modify, investigations of efficacy of these agents critically depend upon the selection of appropriate molecular targets and clinical trial designs. The latter includes selection of appropriate drug combinations for clinical studies and end points for the demonstration of efficacy. Combination therapy is particularly important where the actions of target-based drugs are supplemented or potentiated by other agents and where the target-based drugs may act as sensitizers to the cytotoxic agents, e.g., P-glycoprotein (membrane efflux protein responsible for multi-drug resistance in several cases) inhibitors. The clinical end point for demonstra- tion of efficacy has traditionally been the shrinkage of tumor size, as a surrogate for survival. End points for target-based drugs, such as the levels of surrogate molecular markers, changes in tumor markers, growth rate, time to progression, and the improvement in the quality of life (compared to cytotoxic agents), have been difficult to quantify and correlate with ther- apeutic benefit to the patient. Accordingly, these have been called ‘‘soft end points’’ [10]. Selection of appropriate molecular targets for inhibition or modification, such that the target is tumor specific, non-redundant, and able to influence the outcome of tumor progression, is a significant challenge given the complexity of molecular signaling pathways in cells. Key molecular mechanisms that have been explored for the development of target-based anticancer agents have been discussed in detail by Baguley and Kerr, for example. 2.1.1 Facilitating Apoptosis Apoptosis is a physiologic intracellular process involving a well-ordered signal- ing pathway that leads to cell death and clearance of the dead cells by 52 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai neighboring phagocytes, without inflammation. Cytotoxic drug-induced damage to the cells, especially to the DNA, triggers apoptosis through two signaling mechanisms – the activation and release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins known as caspases under the control of Bcl-2 family of proteins or upregulated expression of pro-apoptotic receptors on cancer cells, whose subsequent interac- tion with their ligands activates apoptotic signaling pathways. These receptors include the Fas (also called APO-1 or CD95) and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligands (TRAIL) receptors. In addition, antic- ancer drugs can activate lipid-dependent signaling pathways that result in decreased apoptosis threshold or modulate other cytoprotective pathways such as the nuclear factor-kB(NF-kB), heat shock proteins, and cell cycle regulatory pathways. 2.1.2 Inhibiting Metastasis Metastasis is the spread of the tumor from one organ or part of the body to another and is attributed to the translocation of cancer cells. This process of tumor cell translocation requires cellular movement as well as the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that physically entraps cells and defines the shape of a tissue, at both the initial and the metastasized sites of tumor growth. Extracellular enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases, and plas- minogen activators (PAs), have been implicated in this remodeling of the ECM, leading to invasion and dissemination of cancer. Thus, drug candidates target- ing proteases and MMP inhibitors have been developed for potential anticancer activity. 2.1.3 Inhibiting Angiogenesis Angiogenesis, the process of formation of new blood vessels from the existing blood supply, is an essential requirement for the growth of tumor mass as well as its metastasis. Thus, prevention of angiogenesis has the potential to block nutrient and oxygen supply to the tumors, resulting in tumor regression. Three key events involved in tumor angiogenesis include the angiogenesis switch that initiates this process, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells to form the lining of new blood vessels, and remodeling of the ECM. Several cellular signal transduction molecules have been identified to play a role in this process including the angiogenic factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the integrins, plasminogen activation system, and the MMPs. Drug targets have been identified to inhibit one or more aspects of these pathways, e.g., VEGF receptor antagonists and VEGF antibodies. 2.1.4 Antibodies Against Tumor-Specific Antigens Induction of antitumor immune responses by using tumor-specific antigens is a cherished goal in cancer therapeutics since it promises to be free of dose-limiting Anticancer Drug Development 53 toxicity. Administration of antibodies against tumor-specific and tumor- associated antigens can be used to target tumors by carrying radioisotopes, toxins, or prodrug converting enzymes. In addition, antibodies per se result in tumor regression by complement fixation or antibody-dependent cellular toxi- city (ADCC) through the involvement of natural killer cells, granulocytes, and monocytes. Additional strategies that have been exploited include the expres- sion of target antigens on the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or dendritic cells to activate body’s T-cell immune response. Thus, preclinical evaluation and clinical development of anticancer agents, especially molecularly targeted therapeutics, present unique challenges – both in the selection of appropriate drug target and in the development of a mole- cular marker of efficacy. Developing an assay for the surrogate markers and its correlation with antitumor efficacy requires a significant research investment with unpredictable outcome. Also, the molecular understanding of cancer growth and metastasis is still developing and the selection of molecular targets for drug development may not succeed in the clinic. These risks and challenges are inherent in the development of molecularly targeted anticancer agents. 2.2 Pharmacogenetics and Metabolomics Therapeutic activity and toxicity of cytotoxic drugs are derived from the same molecular mechanisms and usually correlate directly with the dose. To max- imize clinical benefits, patients are dosed to the maximum levels that do not result in serious side effects. The resulting narrow therapeutic window of these drugs, along with the serious disease condition of the patients and inter- individual variation in drug response and toxicity, constitutes a significant challenge in their clinical development and use. These considerations, in turn, have generated opportunities for the development of tools for individualization of drug therapy to the patient and monitoring of drug response and toxicity using surrogate markers. Tumor treatment has been individualized for patients based on the tumor type, histology, and the disease state. Pharmacogenetics is an emerging paradigm for individualization of drug therapy using the genetic constitution of the patient. Pharmacogenetics involves the genotypic and phenotypic imprinting of the individual patient to identify key genes and their proteins that are involved in the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of drug response and/or toxicity. This analysis is expected to reduce the inter-individual variation in drug–response or minimize the side effects by modulating drug doses to adjust for genetic variability in patients. The targets for genotype profiling in patients are usually the drug-metabolizing enzymes or the drug targets. Among the drug-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily constitutes several isoenzymes that are implicated in the inactivation of anticancer com- pounds, such as CYP1A2 for flutamide, CYP2A6 for tegafur, CYP2B6 for 54 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai cyclophosphamide, CYP2C8 for paclitaxel, and CYP2D6 for tamoxifen [11]. Examples of drug targets whose variation impacts anticancer drug treatment include thymidylate synthase with 5-fluorouracil and the epidermal growth factor receptor with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib [12]. Screening of patients for markers of specific metabolizing enzymes or drug targets is important not only in the clinical setting to reduce the probability of drug exposure related toxicities but also in the clinical trials of novel anticancer agents with narrow therapeutic index. This approach can help achieve indivi- dualization of drug therapy to optimally balance efficacy with toxicity and, thus, contribute to the success of clinical development of novel drug candidates. Metabolomics, on the other hand, involve the quantitative analyses of metabolites in a cell, tissue, or organism. It could involve two strategies – target analysis and metabolite profiling [13]. While target analysis is restricted to the quantification of a chosen class of compounds (related to a specific pathway, intersecting pathways, or the investigational drug candidate), metabolite profil- ing involves analyses of a large number of metabolites with the objective of identifying a specific metabolite profile that characterizes a given sample. The analytical techniques used for metabolomic studies include isotopic (e.g., 13C) labeling of chosen metabolites and monitoring their progress through various pathways and assays for low-level quantification in biological samples such as mass spectroscopy (MS), liquid/gas chromatography – tandem MS (LC-MS/ MS or GC-MS/MS), and ion cyclotron resonance (ICR). Metabolic profiling of a system reflects the net effects of genetic and environmental influences, including disease state and drug therapy. Such profiling can help distinguish between the pre-disease, disease, and normal state of cells and tissues. For example, the metabolic phenotype of cancer cells is characterized by high glucose uptake, increased glycolytic activity, low mitochondrial activity, and increased phospholipid turnover [14]. A meta- bolic profile indicative of any such characteristics can be utilized as a surro- gate marker of disease state. Metabolomic profiling can rapidly detect subtle changes in metabolic pathways and shifts in homeostasis much before pheno- typic changes can be detected [15]. Although metabolomics is an emerging science that will require significant developments before its successful clinical application, it has potential in drug discovery in the identification and devel- opment of biomarkers and classifying patients as responders or non- responders to a given therapy. For example, Chung et al. identified that the ratio (phosphomonoesters/phosphodiesters), measured using 31PNMR spec- troscopy, could be used as a surrogate marker for the antitumor activity of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17 AAG) in cultured tumor cells and xenografts [16]. Narrow therapeutic index combined with the inter-individual variations in drug pharmacokinetics, response, and toxicity adds uncertainty to the clinical trials and use of novel anticancer agents. Pharmacogenetic and metabolomic profiling of the patients promise to at least partly address these concerns, thus helping in the individualization of medication for patients and improved Anticancer Drug Development 55 therapeutic outcomes. In addition, these techniques can improve patient selec- tion for clinical trials based on molecular features of the tumor and patient response variables, toward more efficient and cost-effective drug development [17]. For example, it has been suggested that mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene can help predict sensitivity to gefitinib in lung cancer patients [18]. However, the data required for generating such correla- tions are usually obtained much later in the product development and commer- cialization cycle. Furthermore, these disciplines are still in their infancy and would need significant further developments before their widespread routine use in drug development and clinical application. 2.3 Modulators, Sensitizers, and Supportive Cancer-Care Agents In addition to the cytotoxic and molecularly targeted anticancer agents, drugs acting through several indirect mechanisms are used in the management of cancer. These include the immunomodulators, chemoprotective agents, multi- drug resistance reversing agents, hormonal drugs, photosensitizers, analgesics, anti-emetics, and bone marrow growth factors. The prospect of developing therapeutic vaccines using immunomodulators for tumor treatment has attracted considerable research interest. Immunomo- dulators are the drugs that alter the body’s immune response to tumor cells. These are based on generating humoral and/or T-cell responses to the specific tumor antigens being targeted. Several strategies have been applied to produce immune-mediated anticancer activity, e.g., enhancing the activity of antigen- presenting cells, the use of cytokines such as interleukin-12 and interferon-a to enhance immune activation, and inhibition of T-cell inhibitory signals [19]. Very few of these agents, however, demonstrated statistically significant improvement in clinical end points in phase III studies [20]. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a phenomenon whereby the tumor cells develop resistance to a variety of drug molecules. MDR could be due to the failure of tumor cells to undergo apoptosis in response to chemotherapy or the upregulation of the membrane protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp acts as an efflux pump for a variety of drugs, leading to reduced intracellular concentra- tion and anticancer efficacy. Drugs that inhibit the P-gp efflux pump, therefore, can improve the efficacy of cytotoxic drug treatment. For example, an amlodipine derivative, CJX1, inhibited P-gp and increased the intracellular concentration of doxorubicin, thus reversing doxorubicin resistance of the human myelogenous leukemia cells [21]. Several highly specific P-gp inhibitors, such as tariquidar, zosuquidar, and laniquidar, have entered early stage clinical trials in combination with cytotoxic anticancer agents [22]. Chemoprotective agents are the drugs that can help mitigate the toxic effects of anticancer drugs. For example, the nitrogen mustard ifosfamide causes nephrotoxicity (hemorrhagic cystitis and hematuria), which was attributed to 56 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai its metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde. Co-administration of the sulfhydryl com- pound sodium-2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (mesna) neutralizes the active meta- bolite in renal tubules, thus acting as a chemoprotective agent [23]. Another example of a chemoprotectant is amifostine, which reduces the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin. Amifostine is a thiophosphate prodrug that gets dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase in the normal endothelium in vivo to the active sulfhydryl compound [24]. Hormonal drugs and photosensitizers are non-cytotoxic agents that can have anticancer effects in target populations. The use of hormonal drugs as antic- ancer agents is based on the hormone dependence of certain tumor types, such as endometrial, prostate, ovarian, and breast cancers. Thus, antiestrogens, antiandrogens, and antiprogestins are usually not cytotoxic but may prevent the growth of hormone-dependent tumors by changing the endocrine environ- ment. In many cases, these drugs can be administered by a non-parenteral route, e.g., by oral tablets or transdermal patches. Photosensitizers are the compounds that are therapeutically inactive until irradiated by light. Laser light irradiation of tumor tissues after photosensitizer administration to the patient leads to the generation of free radicals inside and in the vicinity of the tumor tissue, causing tumor destruction. An example of this class of agents includes the porphyrin precursor 5-aminolaevulinic acid, which has been clinically successful [25]. Longer wavelength laser light is pre- ferred over shorter wavelengths because of less direct tissue damage and deeper penetration. Selectivity of tumor damage is achieved by both the concentration of the photosensitizing agent to the tumor and the localized irradiation. In addition, supportive cancer-care agents include drugs that help alle- viate the serious side effects associated with cytotoxic compounds. This class of drugs includes analgesics, anti-emetics, and growth factors. Examples of these compounds include opiates and fentanyl as analgesics; octreotide for diarrhea; and phenothiazines and butyrophenones as anti-emetics. The bone marrow growth factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating growth fac- tor (Filgastrim1) and granulocyte-macrophage (or monocyte) colony sti- mulating factor (Sargramostim1) help stimulate white cell production and reduce the risk of serious infection due to myelosuppression [26, 27]. These therapies are aimed at improving the quality of life of cancer patients, increase compliance, and reduce hospitalization due to adverse effects [28]. Many of these agents are available througha wide varietyofdrugdelivery options including immediate and sustained release formulations, transder- mal products, and depot formulations. 3 Anticancer Drug Development Process Conventional anticancer drug development efforts focused on cytostatic or cytotoxic compounds that caused tumor regression. These paradigms have been expanded to include target pre-selection for the discovery of molecularly Anticancer Drug Development 57 targeted therapeutic agents. In addition, drug types such as immunomodula- tors, chemoprotectants, MDR-reversing agents, photosensitizers, and hormo- nal drugs present an increasing arsenal with unique drug development needs and possibilities of drug combinations to maximize therapeutic outcome. Furthermore, the use of molecular biology technologies such as pharmacoge- netics and metabolomics with cytotoxic agents can help control drug toxicity and better predict drug response. Prudent application of these opportunities is significantly influencing the preclinical and clinical development of novel antic- ancer therapeutics. The new drug discovery and development process is a systematic approach to identify potential new drug candidates and their evaluation for drug-like prop- erties. Although the discovery and development of anticancer compounds follow the same process as any other new molecular entities (NMEs), they have several unique aspects that impact their development paradigms. The new drug development process typically involves the following stages, not necessarily in a sequential manner: 1. Acquisition of potential compounds: This could be achieved by chemical synthesis or by extraction from natural resources. This stage includes the development of analytical methods to confirm identity and purity of the compound, and its stability under real-life and stressed storage condi- tions. Physicochemical properties of the compound are identified, such as the solid-state form (polymorphism, hydrates, and solvates), melting point, solubility, and stability. Synthesis of the molecule is scaled up as the compound progresses in the development pathway. A formulation suita- ble for human administration and commercialization is identified and scaled-up. 2. Drug screening and preclinical pharmacology: This involves ‘‘paper chem- istry’’ whereby the drug structure is compared to those of existing compounds in the databases to identify potential activity, toxicities, degra- dation pathways, metabolic routes, etc. A preliminary screening in cell culture models is carried out to identify the extent and specificity of its antitumor activity. This is followed by the evaluation of efficacy and toxicity in animal models. 3. Clinical development: Clinical development of a drug candidate involves testing in human volunteers to identify the toxicities and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in phase I clinical trials. Subsequently, phase II studies are carried out in patients of selected tumor type to quantify efficacy and confirm dosage. Subsequently, larger phase III studies are aimed at head-to-head comparison of the NCE with the then-best-available therapy. The drug discovery and development process is inherently time and resource consuming with very low success rates, as illustrated in Fig. 2. 58 A.S. Narang and D.S.

Most cytotoxic anticancer compounds were discovered by serendipity or as inhibitors of metabolic pathways involved in cell division. For example, nitrogen mustard was discovered in the 1940s upon investigations by Goodman and Gilman of the lymphoid and myeloid suppression observed in soldiers accidentally exposed to the nitrogen mustard gas during the World War II [5]. The utility of hormone therapy in cancer became evident by the works of George Beatson, who documented shrinkage in breast cancers upon removal of the ovaries [31], and Charles Huggins, who showed that the prostate cancer in dogs can be stalled by castration and by estrogen injection [32]. Similarly, the discovery of anticancer properties of platinum coordination compounds, such as cisplatin, is attributed to Barnett Rosenberg, who was investigating the effect of electric field on the growth of bacteria and observed cessation of cell division due to the contamination of the growth medium with the electrolysis product of the platinum electrode [33, 34]. Mitoxantrone was developed from anthracyclines that were originally developed as stable dyes but had the planar ring structure suitable for intercalation in the DNA double strands [35]. Cancer was recognized primarily as a disease of uncontrolled cell division. Hence, all efforts were directed toward the identification of antiproliferative compounds. Accordingly, regression of tumor size has been recognized as the primary, objective end point of effectiveness in preclinical and clinical testing. Murine models of cancer were developed that rapidly grew tumors. Screening of new compounds in the drug discovery programs was focused on testing them in these rapidly growing tumor models. Several clinically important anticancer compounds were identified using this screen. Nevertheless, the selective use of rapidly growing tumor models was implicated as the reason that the successes occurred mainly in the rapidly growing malignancies, e.g., lymphomas, child- hood leukemia, and germline tumors. Relatively fewer successes were seen for the slow-growing common solid-tumors of the adults, e.g., lung, breast, and colorectal cancers [36]. These criticisms led investigators to modify the pre- screening and screening protocols to include a variety of cell lines and tumor types. These aspects are discussed further in later sections. 3.2 Discovery of Potential Drug Candidates The compounds selected for evaluation as potential anticancer agents could be of natural or synthetic origin. Compounds of natural origin have often provided new leads in the novelty of structures with anticancer activity. Mans et al. have enlisted several examples of naturally derived anticancer compounds [35]. For example, vincristine derived from the periwinkle plant Vinca rosea,etoposide is derived from the mandrake plant Podophyllum peltatum, and taxol, which is 60 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai derived from the pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia. Similarly, doxorubicin and bleomycin are fermentation products of the bacteria Streptomyces; L-asparaginase is derived from the broths of Escherichia coli or Erwinia carotovora; rhizoxin is derived from the fungus Rhizopus chinensis; cytarabine was discovered from the marine sponge Cryptotethya crypta; and bryostatin from the sea moss Bugula neritina. Analogs of natural compounds have often been synthesized to improve their efficacy or toxicity profiles [35]. For example, carboplatin was developed as an analog of cisplatin with reduced renal toxicity, doxorubicin is an analog of dauno- mycin that reduces its cardiotoxicity, and topotecan is an analog of camptothecin with better toxicity profile. Analogs of existing drugs have also been synthesized to improve drug targeting and the pharmacokinetic profiles of drug candidates [35]. For example, tauromustine is a nitrosourea anticancer agent coupled to the brain targeting peptide taurine for targeting CNS tumors, and 9-alkyl morpholinyl anthra- cyclines are analogs of doxorubicin that have been synthesized to reduce drug affinity to the cellular efflux protein, P-glycoprotein. The use of related analogs has also been used to improve drug supply. For example, taxotere was developed to overcome the supply problems with taxol, a natural compound of plant origin with very low yields. The synthetic compounds could be the analogs of known compounds or novel structures. The process of identifying and selecting these candidates has under- gone a sea change in the recent decades with the development of solid-state and combinatorial chemistry and computer modeling of drug–receptor interactions. Discovery of new anticancer agents by laboratory synthesis has evolved from analog evaluation and improvement of new leads to rational design based on drug–receptor or drug–enzyme interactions. Examples of synthetic analogs of natural compounds that demonstrated anticancer activity include the folic acid analog methotrexate and the fluorinated pyrimidine base, 5-fluorouracil. Exam- ples of drugs that have been discovered through the rational design approach by the exploration of molecular mechanisms and interactions with drug targets include EO9, which is a mitomycin C-related indoloquinone and is active against hypoxic tumors; and the ether lipid, ET-10-methoxy-1-octadecyl-2-methyl-rac- glycero-3-phosphocholine, which targets the cell membranes [35]. Invariably, the discovery process leads to far more compounds as potential drug candidates than that can be investigated in the clinic, thus necessitating a screening process for short-listing compounds with the highest potential for clinical success. Computer simulation is used to identify novel and potentially active structures. Selected compounds are tested by cell culture and animal assays to quantify efficacy, identify toxicities, and potentially additional pharmacokinetic and phar- macological properties. These aspects are discussed in the following section. 3.3 Preclinical Evaluation Screening of drug candidates for anticancer activity is done in several stages, which are designed to create a ‘funnel’ with reducing number of compounds entering the successive stages of development, as exemplified in Fig. 2A. This Anticancer Drug Development 61 screening protocol balances the real-life limitations in the number of drug candidates that can be tested in humans each year with the number of potential new drug candidates that show potential for antitumor activity. During preclinical development, novel drug candidates are produced in sufficiently large quantities and tested for their physicochemical, biopharma- ceutical, and solid-state properties. These include the evaluation of solubility, stability in the solid state and solution, pH solubility and stability studies, identification of degradation pathways, isolation of polymorphic forms and their impact on drug solubility and stability, absorption studies in cell culture models and animals, and the drug-excipient compatibility studies. The anticancer activity is evaluated in vitro in cell culture models by cell growth inhibitory or clonogenic assays, which serves as a pre-screen to identify active compounds. The potential toxicities and early pharmacology of selected com- pounds are determined in murine allograft or human xenograft mouse models. For example, at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), new compounds are evaluated for cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against eight cell lines derived from the most common human malignancies. Compounds that show activities in this pre-screen are tested in more detail in a panel of cell lines of the respective tumor type, and subsequently in animal models [37–44]. 3.3.1 Preclinical Efficacy Screening Historically, drug screening in murine models was done in the L1210 mouse leuke- mia model along with the P388 murine leukemia allograft, and a few other models for special cases such as the sarcoma 180, carcinoma 755, and Lewis lung carcinoma models [45]. The measures of anticancer activity are primarily the (a) reduction of tumor size and (b) increase in the life span of the mice. In addition to the anticancer activity, the in vivo screen provides information on potential toxicities, tolerated doses and dosage regimens, and the spectrum of activity. Drugs that were found effective in this model were evaluated in other rodent models, and, if shown broad activity, were taken up for further development. Several anticancer drugs were identified with activity against lymphomas, leukemias, and some pediatric tumors. However, these models were ineffective to yield drugs against slow-growing adult solid tumors, like the mammary, colon, and lung cancers [37–44, 46]. In 1975, the NCI introduced screening in human tumor xenografts in nude mice, and the P388 model was moved to a pre-screening stage. This approach was further refined in the year 1990 to replace animal testing in the pre-screening stage with a cell culture evaluation in 60 tumor cell lines (called the NCI-60 screen), which are derived from human leukemia, small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancers, and other human carcinomas. These cell lines are continuously being replaced and added and are being characterized for molecular markers and other characteristics relevant to regulation of cell growth, division, and differentiation. This pre-screening stage incorporates a panel of the same cell lines grown as xenograft tumors in nude mice. The cell culture pre-screen involves inoculation and growth of cells in micro- titer plates followed by incubation with different concentrations of the potential 62 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai anticancer compounds. At the end of incubation, cell growth is measured by a colorimetric assay and the antitumor potential of the compounds is assessed by their cytostatic or cytotoxic activity. Thus, the NCI-60 screen generates a wealth of information with respect to the dose–response curves of potential compounds in several different cell lines, which represent different cancer types and profiles of molecular markers and biochemical pathways. Collectively, this information on the pattern of cell inhibition can be utilized to generate a ‘fingerprint’ of the compound. Comparing the fingerprint of the novel compound with the library database of compounds with known mechanisms of action can help generate the hypothesis on the mechanism of action of the novel compound. Kohlhagen et al. provide an example of the application of NCI-60 screen to generate a hypothesis for the mechanism of action of a novel compound, designated NSC-314622 [47]. This process involves generation of dose–response curves for all the NCI-60 cell lines, usually involving four-log dilution range of the drug [48]. A typical dose–response curve is exemplified in Fig. 3. The compound’s concentration that inhibits growth by 50% (GI50) for each cell line can be plotted on the x-axis relative to the mean GI50 of the panel of 60 cell lines, with bar to the right indicating higher than the mean concentration and the bar to the left indicating lower than the mean [48]. Using these plots to I ConcentrationCell number(% of initial) 100 50 200 300 II GI50 TGI LC50 Fig. 3 An illustration of the dose–response curves generated during cell culture pre-screening. This example illustrates the dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of drugs on cells cultured in vitro in cell culture dishes. Cell cultures that are not exposed to the drug (I) grow to a hypothetical three- fold, or 300%, of their initial numbers upon culturing in a growth promoting media for a fixed amount of time. Thus, these cells show 200% growth, or 200% increase in viable cell count. However, the cells exposed to the drug (II) have less number of viable cells upon culture under similar conditions for the same amount of time. The number of viable cells in the drug-exposed culture dish depends upon the drug concentration in a manner illustrated by curve II. The drug concentration at which the viable cell count after culture remains the same as the initial, i.e., at 100%, is defined as the total growth inhibitory (TGI) concentration. Drug concentration that halves the growth of cells in culture, i.e., increase in cell numbers to half of the levels seen without drug (which was 200%), is defined as the GI50 (growth inhibition to 50% level). Similarly, the concentration of drug that halves the viable cell count from its initial level (which is 100%) is defined as LC50 (lethal concentration to 50% level). Modified from Shoemaker [44] Anticancer Drug Development 63 define a fingerprint of the compound, Kohlhagen et al. observed similarity in the cytotoxicity profiles of NSC-314622 with that of topotecan, camptothecin, and camptothecin derivatives with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.74, 0.63, and (0.78–0.84), respectively (Fig. 4). This information helped define the initial hypothesis that NSC-314622 was a topoisomerase I poison, which was then developed further using a battery of tests [47]. Although the use of cell culture screens has the advantage of cost-effectiveness, high throughput, and minimizing the use of animals; they inherently lack the pharmacological advantages of in vivo assays. These are relevant not only in cases where prodrug activation is required in vivo but also in several cases where cell culture activity may not be a good indicator of in vivo activity. Furthermore, the changing paradigms of anticancer drug development toward molecularly targeted therapeutics sometimes necessitate the utilization of animal models to validate their mechanism of action. For example, drug candidates that act by such specific mechanisms as inhibition of angiogenesis, prevention of metastasis, and induction of differentiation require specialized approaches that are often developed on a case-by-case basis. Thus, several pharmaceutical companies and other research organizations continue to rely on murine allograft and xenograft models for anticancer drug screening.

This graph displays the drug concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50% (GI50) in the 60 cell lines of the NCI Anticancer Drug Screen, representing different tumor types: (a) leukemia, (b) non-small cell lung cancer, (c) colon cancer, (d) CNS cancer, (e) melanoma, (f) ovarian cancer, (g) renal cancer, (h) prostate cancer, and (i) breast cancer. The y-axis represents the mean GI50 in milligram of drug dose as a positive (upwards) or negative (downwards) deviation from the mean. Similarity between different cell lines in their pattern of antitumor efficacy is compared by the Pearson correlation coefficient analyses. In this example, the Pearson correlation coefficient of NSC 314622 with Topotecan was 0.74 and with Camptothecin was 0.63. Modified from Kohlhagen et al [47]. 64 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai 3.3.2 Preclinical Toxicity Studies The animal toxicological studies of anticancer agents are aimed at predicting (a) a safe starting dose and dosage regimen for human clinical trials, (b) the toxicities of the compound, and (c) the likely severity and reversibility of drug toxicities. For most cytotoxic anticancer agents, toxicity is expected at stan- dard, therapeutically active, doses. This is because the therapeutic effect and toxicity are attributed to the same mechanism. Therefore, cytotoxic compounds are dosed to the maximum tolerable levels to maximize their anticancer efficacy. Hence, their clinical dosages are determined by their anticipated tolerance. Toxicological testing is mainly done in small animals under the precept that the common toxicities of cytotoxic agents, such as bone marrow suppression, can be observed in rodent species. The presence and severity of acute toxicities is ascertained in the test organs by histopathology, biochemistry, and hematology investigations shortly after dosing, while the chronic or long-term toxicities are identified by sacrificing and examining the animals several weeks after dosing. Higher animals, such as primates, are avoided in routine animal toxicological studies due to cost and ethical considerations. Drug–dose correlation between different species is usually derived on the basis of body surface area, although other parameters such as age and body weight have also been used. To determine the phase I entry dose of a cytotoxic anticancer agent, the dose levels that are lethal to 10, 50, and 90% of mice (LD10,LD50, and LD90, respectively) is determined by the same route of administration. Instead of measuring death as an end point, these dose limits could also be defined in terms of doses that cause severe, life-threatening toxicity (severe toxic dose, STD). The projected phase I entry dose is usually 1/10th of the LD10 or STD10. To minimize the risk associated with human administration of a novel cytotoxic compound, the projected phase I entry dose is first tested in another species, usually rats or dogs, to ascertain lack of significant toxicity. Thus, the preclini- cal animal toxicology protocol usually involves single- and multiple-dose leth- ality or severe-toxicity studies in mice, followed by single- and multiple-dose confirmatory toxicity studies in rats or dogs. If serious, irreversible toxicities are exhibited in the non-rodent species at the projected starting dose, then the human starting dose is reduced to the 1/6th of the highest dose tested in the non-rodent species that did not cause any severe, irreversible toxicity. Evaluation of toxicities of anticancer drugs in animals has several limita- tions, since anticancer agents are inherently toxic with usually a dose-dependent manifestation of symptoms. The estimation of dose levels in animal toxicology studies that would correspond to the human clinical doses within the therapeu- tic window is difficult, leading to the possibility of underestimation or over- estimation of the drug’s toxicological profile. This could be due to species differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic responses of drugs, e.g., due to differences in the metabolic and elimination pathways, protein binding, and the sensitivity of target cells. Furthermore, rare toxicities, e.g., those of cardiovascular or neuromuscular origin, are difficult to detect in Anticancer Drug Development 65 animal models. A retrospective study observed 0.5% of toxic deaths in the phase I trials of anticancer agents among \u00036,000 participants [49]. An over prediction is highly undesirable for safety reasons. Under predic- tion, on the other hand, could increase the duration and steps in the dose escalation studies, thus increasing the development costs and time and the unethical administration of ineffective doses to a large number of seriously ill patients [50]. For these reasons, both under and over predictions could result in the dropping out of a molecule from further development. An example of over prediction was seen with the anticancer drug fludarabine. It caused significant bone marrow suppression in phase I studies at the 1/10th of mice LD10 dose, while dose levels up to 20 times higher than this dose did not cause significant bone marrow suppression in dogs. This difference was explained in terms of species differences in drug pharmacodynamics – higher efficiency of phosphor- ylation of the drug in human bone marrow cells than those of the dog [51]. Increase in clinical study time due to underestimation of dose is exemplified by brequinar sodium, which needed 19 dose escalation steps over a period of more than 3 years to reach the MTD, since the MTD was 40 times higher than the mouse LD10 [52]. Another example is flavone acetic acid, for which the single- dose LD10 in mice was similar to that in rats, but dogs and humans tolerated up to four times higher doses. This was attributed to faster drug clearance in the higher species, thus resulting in under prediction of the clinical entry dose [53]. These examples illustrate the need to better estimate drug toxicities in humans to avoid lengthy phase I trials as well as severe drug toxicities. Toward this end, pharmacokinetic analyses are frequently being included in the toxicol- ogy protocols. Recently, drug microdosing have been proposed in humans to understand pharmacokinetic properties before projected doses are adminis- tered. This aspect is discussed further in Section 3.4.2. 3.4 Clinical Testing Clinical trials of drug candidates are carried out in three distinct phases: phase I studies to identify safe dose levels and schedules, phase II studies to identify the spectrum of anticancer activity, and phase III studies to compare the NCE with the up-to-then best-available treatment. In addition, post-marketing surveil- lance phase IV studies continue to monitor drug safety as it is then administered to a significantly greater number of patients. Regulatory involvement is critical at all stages of clinical drug development. As illustrated in Fig. 2, an Investiga- tional New Drug (IND) application is filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before the initiation of phase I studies. At the end of phase II studies, usually a pre-NDA meeting is held with the FDA to discuss the results and the plans for the phase III clinical trials. Upon completion of the phase III studies, a New Drug Application (NDA) is filed with the FDA for the grant of marketing authorization. 66 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai In the case of anticancer drug development, frequently, drug combinations are evaluated instead of a single compound monotherapy. Phase I studies of anticancer agents are usually conducted in patient, rather than healthy, volun- teers. Frequently, this aspect adds to the challenges of developing anticancer compounds since (1) recruitment of tumor-specific patient volunteers becomes difficult and (2) the recruited volunteers are usually in the advanced stages of the disease and refractory to the currently available standard-of-care treatment options. These factors also escalate the clinical costs of drug development. Phase I clinical trials are carried out at progressively escalating doses to identify the dose-limiting toxicities for cytotoxic compounds and are concluded when the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Increments in drug doses in these trials are based on the type, severity, and duration of observed toxicities and their correlation to the expected profile of the given structural class of drugs. Phase I trial concludes when the MTD is reached and the necessary information on the clinical toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti- tumor activity has been gathered. 3.4.1 Dose Escalation Studies Dose escalation refers to increasing the dose of the drug in phase I clinical trials to identify the maximum tolerated dose. The dose could be increased periodically within the same clinical trial or in each new trial arm. The choice of starting dose and dose escalation steps determine the duration of phase I studies, the number of patients who may be treated with subtherapeutic doses, and the precision of the recommended phase II dose. In the special case of cytotoxic anticancer agents, the likelihood of efficacy is dose dependent. In addition, these agents present a clear dose–toxicity relationship. Therefore, dose-related toxicity is regarded, in general, as a surrogate for efficacy [54]. Thus, the dose escalation process is a careful balance between a conservative approach to ensure safety and a guided approach to ensure early detection of the MTD. Historically, the most frequently used scheme for phase I dose escalation of cytotoxic agents has been the ‘modified Fibonacci search.’ This scheme involves dosage increment steps with increasing decreases over the previous dose, e.g., (2, 3.3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16d) as multiples of initial dose (d), or (100, 65, 52, 40, 29, 33, 33%) increases over the previous dose [55]. In contrast to this empirical approach, pharmacologically guided dose escalation (PGDE) scheme proposed by Collins et al. [56] is based on using the preclinical toxicology data to rapidly escalate doses to a target area under the curve (AUC) value obtained from murine pharmacokinetic data. The PGDE scheme is based on the key assumptions that the drug concentra- tion in the plasma can be used as a predictor for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and that the quantitative relationship between toxicity and drug exposure (AUC) is similar across species [56]. Practical limitations of this scheme include the difficulty in obtaining real-time pharmacokinetic data at each dose level, extrapolation of preclinical pharmacokinetic data especially when the dosing Anticancer Drug Development 67 schedules were different, and because of the inter-patient variability. In a retro- spective evaluation of this dose escalation design, Fuse et al. found that the log AUC for LD10 in mice correlated well with the log AUC for MTD in humans for cytotoxic agents whose mechanism of action does not depend upon the cell cycle phase, but not for cell cycle phase-specific agents [57]. Furthermore, accounting for protein binding showed better correlation between the mouse and the human AUC for the unbound drug. In addition, non-pharmacokinetic statistical modeling approaches have been recommended to guide the dose escalation. These statistical approaches model the dose–toxicity relationship as a sigmoidal curve to predict the MTD. The predicted value of the MTD is adjusted as data on the occurrence or the absence of toxicity accumulate from the clinical trial. Thus, the statistical prediction of the MTD is higher when low toxicity is observed, allowing rapid dose escala- tion, and the predicted MTD is low when dose-related toxicity is observed, calling for conservative dose escalation steps. This approach of dose escalation has been termed the continual reassessment method (CRM) [54]. 3.4.2 Inter-patient Variability and Dose Normalization Cytotoxic anticancer compounds are inherently toxic and have low therapeutic window. Nevertheless, they are dosed to very high levels, close to but lower than the MTD, to maximize their therapeutic benefit to the patient. Therefore, inter- patient variability in drug exposure has serious implications on drug effective- ness and toxicity to the patients. The variation in drug exposure arises from differences in drug metabolism and elimination. For example, the total body clearance of carboplatin can range from 20 to 200 mL/min due to inter-patient differences in renal function, since most of the drug is eliminated by glomerular filtration through the kidneys [58]. Similarly, topotecan clearance correlates with renal function [59]. On the other hand, clinical drug exposure and toxicity of 6-mercaptopurine are significantly related to the polymorphic phenotype of its metabolizing enzyme, thiopurine methyltransferase [60]. For drugs with clinically established exposure-physiological parameter correla- tions, dosage adjustment for an individual patient can be done a priori, based on the patient’s physiological parameters, such as genotype and/or phenotype of the metabolizing enzymes (pharmacogenetics, see Section 2.2), renal clearance, serum protein, or hepatic function. In addition, for drugs that are dosed repeatedly or continuously, dosage modification can be based on the measurement of drug blood levels and toxicities in the patient. This strategy has been used for continuous intravenous infusions of etoposide and fluorouracil [61]. Another dosage indivi- dualization strategy involves administration of a low test dose of the compound to determine the exact pharmacokinetic parameters for an individual patient (micro- dosing, see Section 3.4.3), followed by modifying the dose to achieve a target drug exposure.Suchstrategies, however, canonlybeappliedtodrugs forwhich the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationships, or relationships between phy- siological parameters and drug exposure, have been clearly established. 68 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai However, many drugs present complex pharmacokinetic relationships, hindering the establishment of such correlations. Furthermore, the clinical experience is usually very limited with new drugs under development. In such situations, clinical oncologists frequently use body surface area (BSA) for drug dose scaling between individuals. Other physiological scaling parameters, such as age, gender, weight, or body mass index, may have also been used in specific circumstances [62]. The use of BSA as a dose-scaling parameter is credited to its early use showing a correlation of BSA with MTD between species [63, 64]. While the use of BSA in preclinical research for scaling between species is well accepted, its use as a scaling parameter has been widely debated and challenged recently [62, 65–69]. For example, BSA correlates well with the total blood volume and the basal metabolic rate, but not with liver function or the glomerular filtration rate [67, 70–71]. Furthermore, BSA varies significantly more among pediatric (0.4–2.0 m2) than adult (1.6–2.2 m2) patient populations [62]. The limitations inherent in use of BSA for inter-patient drug scaling are also reflected in the drug–dosage modifications from BSA predicted values. For example, the rela- tive dose per square meter is usually increased in children compared to the adult dose [72], ideal body weight is often used in BSA calculation rather than the actual weight [73], BSA is usually capped at 2 m2, and dose reduction is under- taken in patients with compromised renal or hepatic function [67]. Nevertheless, the use of BSA as a scaling parameter has shown reduced inter-patient varia- bility in drug exposure in several cases [62, 74] and remains an established clinical practice that usually gives way to or complements the use of more direct correlations as they get established in clinical practice. Clinical oncologists undertaking new drug development, therefore, need to carefully evaluate the requirement for and the merits and demerits of each modality of inter-patient dose scaling. New drug development programs frequently incorporate measurement of physiological variables, such as the phenotype of key drug-metabolizing enzymes, to establish scaling parameters, where feasible. 3.4.3 Microdosing in Human Clinical Trials The first-in-human clinical trials of novel cytotoxic compounds constitute a significant safety risk for the patient volunteers. A microdosing strategy has been proposed to mitigate this risk, gather pharmacokinetic data in earlier in clinical development, and to increase the efficiency of drug development. The microdosing concept is based on using extremely low doses of a drug, which are pharmacologically inactive but are able to delineate the pharmacokinetic pro- file of the drug in humans [75, 76]. This strategy is also expected to reduce the number of participants required for preclinical safety studies and to more accurately predict the first-in-human doses. The microdose of a small-molecule drug has been defined by the US and European regulatory authorities as ‘‘less than 1/100th of the dose calculated to Anticancer Drug Development 69 yield a pharmacological effect of the test substance to a maximum dose of less than 100 mg.’’ For a protein drug, 30 nmol is considered the maximum dose [77–79]. One key consideration of microdosing studies is the requirement of highly sensitive analytical methods. Such analytical methods include liquid chro- matography with tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS), positron emission tomography (PET), and accelerated mass spectroscopy (AMS). The use of AMS, however, requires the use of 14C radiolabeled drug, making it less popular. The American College of Clinical Pharmacology recently issued a position statement on the use of microdosing in the drug development process [80]. In this chapter, Bertino et al. discussed the key considerations for the predictive success and validation of utility of the microdosing protocol. They noted that the success of microdosing strategy depends upon its ability to accurately predict the key pharmacokinetic parameter estimates, e.g., bioavailability, clearance, and the elimination rate, of a drug at much higher therapeutic doses of the drug. The authors noted that only a few studies have reported the comparison of the therapeutic with the microdose data. These studies, however, have used currently marketed drugs and suffer from the limitation of ‘prior knowledge’, which helps clinical study design in aspects such as the sampling intervals. A significant limitation of microdosing studies is their inability to predict PK parameters where drugs exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Nevertheless, this new paradigm of anticancer drug development can complement the existing animal-to-human dose-scaling strategies to improve the safety and the success of early clinical trials. 3.4.4 Drug Combinations and Dosing Strategies New anticancer agents are categorized in different classes based upon their chemistry, bioactivity profile, and mechanism of action. Furthermore, their clinical use is usually proposed in combination with current therapy, utilizing the established principles and advantages of combination drug therapy to achieve clinical outcomes better than the then-best-available treatment. This section briefly reviews the basis of clinical anticancer drug combinations to understand the drug combinations and dosing strategies utilized during new drug development. Currently established anticancer drugs include the cytotoxic agents, that damage or kill cells by inhibiting cell division, and hormonal agents, which antagonize hormone action or inhibit its secretion. Hormonal drugs include the glucocorticoids, estrogens, antiestrogens, androgens, and antiandrogens. Cytotoxic agents act as antimetabolites such as pentostatin, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil; DNA polymerase inhibitors, such as cytarabine; alkylating agents such as cisplatin and mitomycin; RNA synthesis inhibitors, such as doxorubicin, etoposide, and amsacrine; microtubule func- tion inhibitors, such as vinca alkaloids, vincristine and vinblastine; or protein synthesis inhibitors, such as crisantaspase. Based on their action during the cell cycle, these drugs could be classified as being cell cycle active, with or without 70 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai phase specificity (e.g., G0, G1, M, G2, or S phase of the cell cycle), or non-cell cycle active. Thus, antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil and 6-mercaptopurine, and the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, methotrexate, are S-phase specific; bleomycin and vinca alkaloids are G2/M-phase specific; alkylating agents (e.g., nitrogen mustard, cyclophosphamide) and doxorubicin are non-phase specific; and corti- costeroids such as prednisone and dexamethasone are non-cell cycle active. Combining drugs in clinical use is a purview of the clinical oncologist and is an ever evolving discipline. Over a hundred clinically used chemotherapy combinations are recognized [81], a detailed discussion of which is beyond the scope of this chapter. Nevertheless, there are a limited set of principles that underlie drug combinations in anticancer treatment [82]. Briefly, the drugs used in combination should possess one or more of the following features: 1. Act by different mechanisms 2. Have some efficacy by themselves 3. Have a different spectrum and/or cell cycle phase specificity of cell kill 4. Have different toxicity profiles 5. Have different mechanisms of resistance development. Synergistic or additive cell kill, without increasing toxicity, is a frequent goal of drug combinations [83]. The need for higher cell kill is indicated by the first- order nature of this phenomenon, whereby chemotherapy cycles reduce tumor cell number by a given percentage irrespective of the starting cell count. For example, if a drug leads to 99.99% cell kill, it would reduce the tumor cell load of a usually detectable 2 cm solid tumor mass from \u0003109 to \u0003105 cells (the cell kill principle) [84]. The cell kill efficiency of cytotoxic drugs is expressed by the negative log of the fraction of tumor cell population killed by a single course of treatment. Thus, a drug that results in 99.99% cell kill is a 4-log drug, while another drug with 99.9% cell kill would be called a 3-log drug. Additive combination of these drugs, for example, would be expected to result in 7-log cell kill per treatment cycle. Thus, different drugs are given at full doses to increase the percent cell kill toward improved overall clinical outcome and patient survival, while reducing the number of chemotherapy cycles and the emergence of drug resistant cancers. The principles of chemotherapeutic drug combinations resulting in better clinical outcomes can be exemplified by the use of MOPP combination in Hodgkin’s disease and M-BACOP in diffuse lymphoma [85]. The MOPP combination uses nitrogen mustard with vincristine, prednisone, and procar- bazine with significantly improved antitumor efficacy and remission rate than any drug alone. It further exemplifies the principles of dose combination, i.e., it uses full dose of drugs with different toxicity profiles (neuropathy with vincristine and typical steroid toxicity with prednisone) and reduced dose of drugs with similar toxicity profiles (bone marrow toxicity of procarbazine and nitrogen mustard). The M-BACOP combination uses methotrexate with bleo- mycin, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone with the same principles of reducing the dose of drugs with overlapping toxicities Anticancer Drug Development 71 (bone marrow suppression with adriamycin and cyclophosphamide), but not for different target toxicities (lung toxicity with bleomycin, neuropathy with vincristine, and steroidal toxicity with prednisone). In addition to drug dosing based on individual and overlapping toxicities of anticancer agents, cytotoxic drugs are dosed in short-duration high-dose cycles rather than a continuous low-dose administration. This is designed to achieve the most cell kill with a high drug dose, while allowing the body to recover from the side effects of chemotherapy between different cycles of treatment. The cell kill efficiency of cytotoxic drugs is the most evident in a solid tumor model (e.g., lung, uterus, and stomach cancer) whereby the tumor consists of actively dividing surface cells overlaying resting cells in the middle, and non-dividing, often non-viable, cells in the core [84]. While short-duration chemotherapy to aggressively kill actively dividing cancer cells is the most common practice, the introduction of novel target- based anticancer agents has allowed changes in the regimens to include con- tinuous, low-dose administration of targeted drugs. For example, Klement et al. report a low-dose anti-angiogenesis regimen utilizing vinblastine com- bined with an antibody against the VEGF receptor-2 [86]. The authors reported tumor remission without undue toxicity of drug treatment. This approach is particularly applicable to the use of antiangiogenic drugs and has been called low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy [87]. The clinical development of new anticancer agents builds on the knowl- edgebase and current practices with existing therapies. Thus, an understand- ing of drug combinations and dosing relevant to specific disease conditions allows the clinical oncologists to appropriately place new chemical entities in a clinical program to maximize the probability of its beneficial outcome to the patient. 3.4.5 Adverse Effects and Toxicities of Anticancer Drugs An understanding of toxicities, adverse effects, and special dosing considera- tions of existing anticancer compounds is important to the design of effective drug combinations and to the interpretation of the toxicological profile of new chemical entities. Most cytotoxic anticancer agents are dosed to maximum tolerated levels to achieve maximum cell kill. The toxicities incumbent with these compounds are often a manifestation of their mechanism of action and killing of the rapidly growing, normal cells such as hair follicle cells, gastro- intestinal surface epithelial cells, and stem cells. The common toxicities of cytotoxic anticancer drugs include the following: \u0002 Bone marrow depression due to damage to the growing stem cells causes reduction in the blood white cell, platelet, and red cell counts. These, in turn, could cause susceptibility to infections, excessive bleeding, and anemia. In addition, certain drugs cause unique and serious bone damage, such as the osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with bisphosphonates [88]. 72 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai \u0002 Damage to growing cells may cause temporary loss of hair (alopecia), skin rashes, changes in the color and texture, or loss of fingernails and toenails. These toxicities are usually reversible. \u0002 Surface epithelial damage to the gastrointestinal tract may result in ulcers, stomatitis, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), vulnerability to oral infections such as candidiasis, and changes in saliva secretion. In addition, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation occur commonly. \u0002 Some drugs may cause kidney damage due to extensive cell destruction, purine catabolism, and deposition of urates in the renal tubules. In addition, liver damage may occur it receives large blood supply. Metabolic conditions of the liver and the kidney are usually monitored for possible correlation to drug blood levels and dosage adjustment, since these are the major drug elimination sites. \u0002 Certain symptoms and side effects associated with cancer could be secondary to disease progression. For example, cancer metastases to the bones could cause chronic pain due to proliferation of cancer cells in the bones and the associated bone remodeling and destruction [89]. Also, tumors that com- press veins, the use of central vein catheter [90], and relative immobility of the patient could lead to deep vein thrombosis with potential pulmonary embolism [91]. \u0002 Certain drugs, such as paclitaxel and vincristine, could cause peripheral neuropathy [92]. Similarly, anthracyclines are known for rare but serious cardiotoxicity [93, 94]. Thus, adverse drug effects and dose-limiting toxicities of anticancer com- pounds could be a manifestation of either their mechanisms of action or unrelated toxicities common to a given chemical class of compounds, such as anthracyclines. A close attention to monitor for the emergence of known side effects of anticancer drugs as well as those observed in the preclinical animal toxicology studies ensures patient safety in early oncology drug clinical trials. 3.4.6 Special Patient Populations Clinical trials in special populations, such as pediatric and geriatrics, nursing and pregnant women, and patients with reduced renal function, are routinely carried out to define the subtleties of clinical application of all drug candidates. These usually involve delineation of a drug’s metabolic and elimination path- ways, identification of biochemical markers to define the metabolic status of the patient with respect to drug’s elimination, genotypic and phenotypic profiling of the patient, defining pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic relationships, and dosage adjustment. These principles are practiced with greater vigor for anticancer drugs due to their dose-limiting toxicities, dosing to maximum tolerated levels, and other serious adverse effects. In addition, pediatric testing of anticancer agents is necessitated by child- hood prevalence of fast growing cancers, such as lymphomas, leukemias, and Anticancer Drug Development 73 myelomas. Furthermore, regulatory agencies are increasingly encouraging pediatric clinical trials to establish safe and effective doses for pediatric labeling [95, 96]. Phase I clinical trials in children are usually multi-institutional, due to the number of patients available. Ethical considerations further limit the num- ber of levels of dose escalation in children, since treatment with ineffective doses is undesirable. In addition, these trials also enlist patients with intensive prior therapy, which has implications on the maximum tolerated dose determination. Heavily pretreated patients tend to have lower MTDs, especially when DLT involves myelosuppression; which is not the case for patients with minimum prior therapy – thus complicating the determination of MTDs [97]. Pediatric testing of anticancer agents is carried out after the efficacy of these drugs has been established in the adults. A common practice in pediatric oncology is to administer 80% of the MTD determined in adult patients with significant prior therapy and to conduct dose escalation in 30% increments. Further, dose escalation is carried out in successive cohorts of patients since intra-patient dose escalation is usually not permitted and the number of dose escalation steps is sought to be minimized [97]. A retrospective investigation of 69 pediatric oncology trials found that the pediatric MTD strongly correlated with adult MTD and differed by not more than 30% of the dose. They further found that not more than four dose levels were studies in the escalation schemes in over 80% of the trials [98]. 3.4.7 Phase II and III Clinical Trials As a drug candidate progresses through the development stages after the initial proof-of-concept and phase I studies in humans, a reverse funnel of increasing patient exposure to the drug becomes evident (Fig. 2B). Phase II studies are carried out in a small group of patients with a specific tumor type to determine anticancer efficacy and to define the therapeutic window of the compound. To avoid exposing patients to inactive compounds, these clinical trials use statistical tools to interrupt studies where the in-process data indicate low probability of success. Phase III trials are conducted in a much greater number of patient volunteers of the selected tumor type with prospective and randomized evaluation against the then-available best-possible therapy for the disease, regarded as the standard-of-care in the specific cancer setting. Phase II studies act as a screen of antitumor efficacy to select the most promising agents to enter the pivotal phase III clinical trials. The demonstration of statistically significant improvement in tumor response in large phase III clinical studies against the currently best-available treatment in a tumor type- specific patient population is the ultimate benchmark for regulatory approval and marketing of a novel anticancer agent. Phase III cancer clinical trials are usually conducted by certain cooperative groups that were founded in the 1960s and later years and include several member institutions participating in a multitude of trials that are actively ongoing at any given time [99]. Examples of these groups include the Children’s 74 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai Oncology Group, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B [100–102]. Several of these groups are associated with academic institutions. A phase III cancer clinical trial, therefore, is a complex interaction among the cooperative groups involved, their associated academic institutions, the commercial sponsors, and the regulatory agencies. There are certain key elements of any clinical trial that are incorporated in the study protocol. These include a clear definition of the objectives, end points, inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of patient volunteers (study population), treatment plan, clinical assessments, laboratory tests, trial design (including randomization), statistical considerations, data monitoring proto- cols, and informed consent. Conduct of cancer clinical trials adds unique perspectives and limitations on several of these elements. For example, blinding is often not utilized. This is because of distinct dosing schedules, routes of administration, and toxicity profiles that makes blinding difficult [99]. In addi- tion, often non-inferiority trials are conducted with the goal to prove that the therapeutic benefit of a drug is not lost with a new regimen or treatment approach, such as drug combination or change in the route of administration. 3.4.8 Trial Design Phase II clinical cancer trials are traditionally designed as single-arm trials utilizing historical controls on the currently best-available treatment, while phase III studies usually use a parallel-arm design. These designs are in contrast to the preference for crossover randomized designs for both phase II and phase III studies in other drug classes. Crossover designs are not preferred for cancer clinical trials to avoid carryover of the treatment effect of the first trial period into the second. The end points used in the cancer clinical trials require that the patients be in the similar overall clinical state at the beginning of both treatment periods. For example, the end point of survival benefit cannot be used in a crossover design. Also, patient tolerance to toxicities may change for the second treatment cycle in the crossover design [99]. Single-arm designs for phase II clinical trials use the proportion of patients who achieve a complete or partial response to the treatment as the primary efficacy measure. This design eliminates truly ineffective therapy and is based on the ‘historical control’ that only a limited number of tested drugs had any activity [103]. Although this design has served well for cytotoxic drugs, recent high attrition rates in phase III oncology trials has led to its criticism for inability to predict comparative performance vis-a` -vis the then-available best- possible, standard-of-care therapeutic option. Furthermore, the molecularly targeted agents, e.g., gefitinib, bevacizumab, and cituximab, may not achieve consistent, high-level tumor regression. These aspects have prompted the con- sideration of randomized, parallel-arm designs controls and alternative end points [104]. Anticancer Drug Development 75 3.4.9 End Points of Cancer Clinical Trials End point for determining the efficacy in clinical trials of anticancer drugs is an evolving subject. Phase III cancer clinical trials focus on one primary end point to provide evidence of clinical efficacy and one or more secondary end points to delineate biological activity or benefits to the patient, e.g., reduced side effects. Three kinds of end points have been used: (1) objective tumor response, e.g., size regression; (2) time to event end points; and (3) patient-reported outcomes, e.g., palliation of side effects [99]. Tumor regression as an end point is quantified by unidimensional or bidimensional measurement of the size of lesions by clinical examination or imaging-based methods, such as X-ray, computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, ultrasound, endoscopy, and laparoscopy. The determination of overall tumor response (as complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease) is based on the observed responses in target and non-target lesions and the appearance of new lesions after treatment [105]. This approach is limited in its inability to account for stable disease and minor response, which could be the only observable direct tumor responses for molecularly targeted agents. In addi- tion, it requires the consideration of inherent variations in biological responses, subjectivity in measurement, and measurement techniques. Time to event end points measure either of the following [99]: \u0002 Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to time of death from any cause. It is often considered an optimal efficacy end point for phase III cancer clinical trials. \u0002 Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from randomization to disease recurrence or death owing to disease progression. It is frequently used as a primary end point in phase III trials. \u0002 Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to time of progressive disease or death. \u0002 Time to treatment failure (TTF) is defined as the time from randomization to documentation of progressive disease, death, patient discontinuation of study. \u0002 Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression or death. It is a preferred regulatory end point since it includes death and may correlate better with overall survival [106]. These studies increasingly also include the quality of life analyses to determine whether the improvements in PFS or survival outweigh the disadvantages of toxicity and inconvenience [107]. The development of newer molecularly targeted anticancer agents is further influencing the paradigms of anticancer efficacy evaluation [8]. Determination of clinical end points for these drugs could be based on the quantifiable pharmacodynamic characteristics such as the target inhibition or the levels of a tumor-specific biochemical marker in the plasma. The use of target markers for determining drug response is exemplified by the 76 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai measurement of farnesyltransferase activity in buccal scrapings for farnesyltrans- ferase inhibitors [108] and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration for the angiogenesis inhibitor anti-VEGF receptor-2 monoclonal antibody [109]. The use of this strategy, however, requires marker validation and correlation with anticancer response, which is not trivial. For example, while a biologically effective dose of marimastat was defined based on tumor marker levels in plasma in phase I–II clinical studies, the phase III studies did not show substantial benefit [8]. 4 Potentials and Practices in Anticancer Drug Delivery Initial screening of drug candidates in cell culture and animal toxicology studies is usually carried out in the solution form utilizing relatively small quantities. Early stage drug development requires physicochemical characterization of the drug candidate for its solubility and stability characteristics in addition to the chemistry, i.e., proof of structure and control of impurities during synthesis. This stage involves the development of stability indicating analytical methods for the assay of potency and impurity content, and the selection of a solvate or hydrate and the crystal form of the compound. As a compound is funneled down to successively higher stages of drug development, the compound is synthesized in larger quantities with much higher purity and a parallel formula- tion development effort is undertaken to prepare a dosage form for clinical testing. Although formulation development of anticancer drugs follows the same precepts as for any drug candidate, special considerations are applicable to the formulation of anticancer compounds for early clinical screening. Formulation choices for anticancer drugs depend upon the physicochemical and biopharma- ceutical properties of the drug candidate, its intended dose and route of admin- istration, and the patient and disease factors. An important paradigm for anticancer drug delivery is the preference of the intravenous (IV) route of administration, especially for cytotoxic compounds. The IV route is preferred to avoid any bioavailability issues and problems with oral administration, especially since nausea and vomiting are common side effects of most cytotoxic agents. This also allows accurate dosing, flexibility of dose and dosing schedule, and rapid withdrawal of the drug if undue toxicity is observed. Another impor- tant consideration is to minimize the possibility of compromising the therapeu- tic efficacy of the drug. Thus, preservatives are avoided and excipients are minimized to reduce the possibilities of potential incompatibilities, such as physical adsorption or chemical complexation. A historical review of formulations most commonly used for anticancer drug delivery indicates that parenteral, especially IV, injection is the first choice, followed by oral tablets or capsules, with only a handful of formulations appearing as gel, implant, or aerosol [110]. Some examples of parenteral for- mulations and the basis of their selection are included in Table 1 [111].

For example, the water-insoluble and unstable nitrogen mustard, carmustine, is supplied in lyophilized vials with sterile drug. Separately, vials with sterile, dried ethanol and sterile water for injection are provided. At the time of use, the drug is dissolved in ethanol and further diluted with water before injection. Another example of a water- insoluble and water-unstable drug administered unconventionally is spiromus- tine. It is supplied as a lyophilized drug in vials, which is first dissolved in sterile ethanol and then dispersed in a sterile emulsion for intravenous administration. Commercially available IV nutrition emulsions, such as those of soybean oil, e.g., Intralipid1, or safflower oil, e.g., Liposyn1, are used for this purpose. The investigational drug carzelesin offers another example of the unique drug delivery possibilities with anticancer therapeutics. Carzelesin is highly insoluble and is available as a solution in polyethylene glycol 400, ethanol, and polysorbate 80 for dilution in the IV infusion fluid immediately before administration. However, due to its tendency for rapid crystallization, it is administered to patients with a two-pump infusion system such that the drug solution and the infusion solution come in contact with each other for a very brief period before entering the bloodstream. The use of unconventional drug delivery systems often presents unique drug development challenges. For example, paclitaxel is formulated in a 1:1 mixture with the surfactant cremophor and ethanol (Taxol1). Intravenous administra- tion of this agent resulted in local toxicity and systemic hypersensitivity reac- tions when the drug was infused over a 3 hour period [112]. This resulted in prolongation of the infusion rate of taxol to 6 hours or longer [113]. Further clinical studies to define the appropriate rate and amount of drug administra- tion to minimize systemic toxicity resulted in a clinical protocol that identified a low-dose, low-duration (135–175 mg/m2 infused in less than 6 hours) adminis- tration regimen with superior hematologic toxicity and neurotoxicity profile than a similar or higher dose, longer duration (170 mg/m2 or more infused over 24 hours) administration [114]. Thus, sophisticated formulations can poten- tially lead to toxicity to the patients, resulting in increased clinical testing, delays, and possibly the drug development program. A significant requirement of anticancer drug development is the extraordi- narily high amount of safety precautions necessary in the handling of these drug substances from the first discovery stages through commercial production. These safety precautions often slow down the pace of drug development and necessitate infrastructural investments to explore technologies that minimize potential exposure and hazard to the employees. Pharmaceutical companies actively engaged in anticancer drug development commonly have special con- tainment areas and ventilation hoods for the handling of these substances. An example of investment in technologies for employee safety reasons is the adop- tion of single-pot processors for wet granulation, which enables granulation 82 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai followed by drying in the same mixer [115]. Several of these equipments are now commercially available [116]. Increasingly, oral drug formulations of anticancer agents are being developed. The incentives for oral drug formulation of anticancer agents include improved safety, efficacy, quality of life, reduced cost, and the ability to deliver chemother- apy at home and to apply drug schedules that maximize an agent’s efficacy [117]. The development of oral drug formulations is constrained by restrictions in dose size, bioavailability concerns, and patient compliance – especially for drugs that cause nausea and vomiting. The preference for oral route of administration is reflected in the increasing number of drugs being formulated as tablets or capsules. Examples of anticancer compounds that have been marketed as oral solid dosage forms include anastrozole, dasatinib, gefitinib, tamoxifen, mercap- topurine, 6-mercaptopurine, estramustine, cyclophosphamide, levamisole, tore- mifene, letrozole, capecitabine, and exemestane [110]. 5 Regulatory Considerations Anticancer drug development brings forth unique perspectives and their reg- ulation has evolved to accommodate and address those unique aspects. One key driving force for anticancer drugs is the urgent patient need for the development of new agents and the need to rapidly move the promising agents into clinical trials. Another is the recognition that these agents are dosed to toxic levels, close to the maximum tolerated dose, MTD, with the precept that the side effects of drug therapy would be less threatening to the patient than their disease. Control of clinical toxicity is sought by careful dosing, monitoring, and prompt treat- ment of toxicity, or drug withdrawal. The regulatory requirements for anticancer compounds focus on drug safety evaluation in preclinical toxicology studies, based on the intended use and mechanism of action of the drug, and the target patient population. As DeGeorge et al. point out, in situations where the potential benefits of therapy are the greatest, e.g., advanced, life-threatening disease, the greater risks of treatment toxicity can be accepted and the requirements for preclinical testing can be minimal [118]. Nevertheless, in cases where the patient population is free of known disease, e.g., adjuvant therapy, chemoprevention, or healthy volun- teers, the acceptable risks are much less and preclinical evaluation is more extensive. As discussed before, two acute preclinical toxicity studies are required. The first is in a rodent species to identify doses that result in lethality or life- threatening toxicities to derive the clinical phase I entry dose. The second study is conducted in a non-rodent species to confirm that the selected dose is not lethal and does not cause serious or irreversible toxicity. It is highly desir- able that these preclinical toxicology studies be conducted with the same schedule, duration, formulation, and route of administration of the drug as Anticancer Drug Development 83 proposed in the clinical trials. The requirements for preclinical studies depend upon the nature of the drug being developed. Cytotoxic anticancer agents are administered in short-term phases and thus need acute preclinical toxicity studies (generally, less than 28 days). On the other hand, non-cytotoxic agents, such as immunomodulators or hormonal drugs, are intended for long-term use with continuous daily administration. Thus, the preclinical toxicology study requirements for non-cytotoxic drugs are equiva- lent to the duration of intended therapeutic use in patients, up to 6 months in rodent and 12 months in a non-rodent species. In addition, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity studies are required for the new drug application (NDA) submission. Special toxicity studies may be needed in cases where compound or drug-class-specific toxicities are known. For exam- ple, anthracyclines are known for their cardiotoxic potential and platinum- based drugs are likely to exhibit ototoxicity [119]. The dosing of non-cytotoxic agents, such as immunomodulators, is aimed to a pharmacodynamically active range, usually much lower than the MTD. In addition, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are recom- mended to support the safety profile of the drug, which may help in deciding the starting dose, route, schedule, the dose escalation steps, and optimum plasma concentrations for the phase I clinical trials. Combinations of cytotoxic agents generally do not need preclinical toxicology testing if the agents have individually been used in humans and have an established safety profile, unless there is a reason to believe there could be synergistic interactions that might lead to increased toxicity [118]. Preclinical toxicological evaluation of non-cytotoxic agents depends on the kind of agents and therapeutic options being investigated. For example, photo- sensitizers require special testing protocols because of their unique modes of action and toxicity. Photosensitizers form free radicals upon absorption of light energy, which are then responsible for site-specific tumor destruction. Exposure of the patients to sunlight could cause retinal damage or phototoxicity similar to sunburn [120]. Therefore, toxicological evaluation of photosensitizers involves photosensitivity assessment as a function of the dose of light (total energy of irradiant light) in relation to that of the drug, and the correlation of photosensitivity to the plasma levels of the photosensitizer. Also, knowledge of the elimination half-life of the compound may be used to determine the dura- tion of time a patient needs to take precautions against exposure to intense light. Regulatory preclinical testing requirements for specialized drug delivery systems such as antibody-drug conjugates, liposomes, and depot formulations include the proof-of-concept studies that the claimed advantage of these sys- tems is indeed being derived without additional toxicity burden. For example, safety concerns for antibody-drug conjugates include the potential for toxicity from abrupt release of the drug and the potential for unexpected specific toxicity in normal human tissues [118]. Thus, in addition to the standard toxicity testing, investigations of the stability of the conjugate as a function of the release mechanism and the reactivity of the conjugate with a complete panel 84 A.S. Narang and D.S. Desai of human tissues (with and without the target antigen expression) are recom- mended. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies that distinguish between the conjugate, free antibody, and the free drug are desirable [118]. Toxicology studies for hormonal drugs, e.g., antiestrogens, antiprogestins, antiandrogens, aromatase inhibitors, and gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists, are recommended using the same route, formulation, schedule, and duration of treatment. In addition, preclinical evaluation of both sexes is recommended, even though these drugs are usually prescribed for sex-specific indications, to delineate the toxicities unrelated to the primary hormonal action of the drug. In addition, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and carcinogeni- city studies are indicated [118]. Agents that target the multi-drug resistance (MDR) of the tumors to anti cancer drugs may lead to increased toxicity of the combination. Thus, preclini- cal toxicity evaluation of new MDR-reversing agents is recommended in combination with the cytotoxic drug at both minimally and significantly toxic doses, in addition to the toxicological evaluation of the agent alone. Similar approach is applied for chemotherapy sensitizers [118]. In brief, the preclinical toxicology evaluations of novel agents are based on the mechanism of action and the potential additional toxicities that may emanate from the modalities of drug administration. 6 Conclusions The clinical application of anticancer drugs brings forth unique perspectives that are evident in their discovery and development. Historical development of cytotoxic compounds, with significant contributions from serendipity, and the currently shifting focus on target-based drug discovery is evident in the evolving paradigms of preclinical and clinical evaluation of new drug candidates. Current challenges of anticancer drug development include the significant time and cost involvement, and the low success rates. These have led to increas- ing efforts of the pharmaceutical industry toward increasing the effectiveness of the drug discovery and development process and to minimize failure of drug candidates at later stages of development. These efforts include development of high throughput preclinical screening methods and biological assays with greater specificity and predictability. Increasing emphasis is being placed on developing a mechanistic understanding of the physicochemical and biological phenomena involved in drug development such as chemical and polymorph stability, and pharmacokinetics. The use of mathematical models to explain the mechanisms of drug degradation and predict the outcomes of formulation and process changes and scale-up is increasingly being adopted. The paradigm of continuous improvement is now incorporating a risk-based approach, where the risk to the patient is continuously evaluated through the course of drug development. The level of risk is mitigated or minimized by appropriate Anticancer Drug Development 85 measures. The critical product quality attributes (CQAs) are defined and a design space is created around all the formulation and process variables with demonstrated, reproducible achievement of the product CQAs. This chapter has attempted to highlight the unique aspects of anticancer drugs from a pharmaceutical development viewpoint, some of which are highlighted in Table 2. The evolving paradigms of anticancer drug develop- ment demonstrate the increasing influence of scientific advancements in diverse fields and increased understanding of the disease process. These trends are expected to continue with the hope for more effective and less toxic therapeutic options.

In the world, 7.6 million people died of cancer in 2005 [1]. However, the cure for advanced cancer in major cancers has not improved in the past 50 years, although chemotherapy is supposed to be a last resort, if not all [2, 3]. One of the recent successful stories in cancer chemotherapy is imatinib (Gleevec1), a drug for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which is an inhibitor of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase, a product of oncogene. Imatinib shows a remarkable thera- peutic effect against CML while a natural course of life span of CML patients is about 5 years. However, upon blastic period when the leukemic cell growth becomes exponential, majority of patients developed drug resistance within 6 months. Therefore, one can conclude that imatinib contributes only 10% prolongation of the life span. In addition, some more fashionable molecular target drugs, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin1) which is a humanized mono- clonal antibody for treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer [4] and sorafenib (Torisel TM); sunitinib (Sutent1) and temsirolimus (Nexavar 1) for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma; and bevacizumab (Avastin1) as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial cell growth factor [5], have received great attention in recent years.

Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_3, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 93 1.2 Problems However, experimental data based on cancer genomics showed that above- mentioned strategies may have only limited efficacy. Regardless of the monoclon- ality or polyclonality of human cancer origin, the tumor of a cancer patient has a large number of mutations in their cancer cells. In fact, it was reported that 13,023 genes of an individual tumor in 11 breast and 11 colorectal cancer patients revealed an average of about 90 mutant genes, and contained a wide range of uncommon mutant genes [6, 7]. It thus indicated potential difficulty in limiting a single epitopic target in cancer treatment. In addition, emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells during the treatment greatly hampers the efficacy of the treatment. In consistent with the above account, clinical evaluation of these molecular target drugs or antibody drugs was found to be effective only for 4–5% of the patients, and now they were considered meaningful only as an adjuvant ther- apy, as many reported in the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting in recent years. To make it worse, the cost of manufacturing is so high, although polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated interferon a (IFN-a) of MW 50 kDa can make better cost/performance benefit compared with native IFN-a. A recent report from the UK said Avastin1 was rejected for reimbursement from national insurance system [8]. The only incentive of such expensive drugs is that they are financially lucrative for megasize pharmaceutical companies. In Japan large pharmaceutical companies have now shifted the gear toward anti- tumor molecular target drug development, although the social insurance system may become at risk financially, while the cost of clinical development is soaring which will be transferred to the price of the drugs. In any case the improvement of survival span with these drugs may be only a limited percent, meantime various burdens such as severe side effects, cost, and quality of life (QOL) to patients impose another problem [9]. In the Editorial of recent issue of The Lancet, criticism was raised by NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of UK) chairman, Michael Rawlins, on the pricing strategy and profit motives of pharmaceutical industry, and he suggested another parameter ‘‘QALY (quality adjusted life year) for drug appraisal’’ [10]. Similarly, Office of Fair Trading of UK released a report expressing a concern of pricing mechanism involving Pharmaceutical Price Regulation System [11]. As to the efficacy of current chemotherapy, critical evaluation of traditional chemotherapy was undertaken in the breast cancer patients who underwent surgery, with or without chemotherapy. The benefit of survival gain by adju- vant chemotherapy is marginal, 5% in 60 months despite the severe side effects, cost, and moribund QOL [12]. Speaking of response rate in chemotherapy, even Herceptin1 is not a miracle agent for the breast cancer. Its primary target is the estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients which comprises about 20% of total breast cancer patients, and 20% of them show good response. The overall efficacy of Herceptin in breast cancer is only 4–5%. 94 T. Seki et al. In the normal business transaction of any commodity, the case which meets the requirement of customer less than 20% or less may be considered undesir- able if not fraudulent [13]. It is thus necessary to develop anticancer drugs with more universal, more tumor selective, or pinpoint targeting potential, which may not be as specific as antibody, but cover universal characteristics of solid tumor, and are thus capable of eradicating total cancer cells without damaging systemic immune and other vital functions. We believe a clue for this tumor- selective delivery is seen in the EPR effect-based drug development, and its further augmentation is technically possible. 1.3 Population Dynamics of Cancer Cells and Recurrence of Cancer When cancer is detected as palpable or by X-ray imaging, most cancer mass consists of as many as 109\u00021012 cells. Conventional chemotherapy for cancer treatment using low molecular weight cytotoxic agents cannot reduce the number of cells to less than 0.01\u00020.001%, but most likely 60\u000290% per one cycle in clinical setting. This means common treatment leaves at least 107\u00021010 cancer cells escaping from the treatment and survive. When we inoculate 105\u00025\u0003106 cancer cells to healthy mice, tumor will grow within a few weeks, and it is formidable to treat when the size is more than 2 cm in diameter. Further conventional chemotherapy often causes serious side effects that lead to dys- function of vital organs, such as the heart, kidney, and bone marrow, as well as nausea, vomiting, neurotoxicity, diarrhea, and loss of hair or appetite [9, 12]. To overcome these problems, we need to develop more tumor-selective anticancer drugs, because this method would improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce the side effectsto normal organs. Conventional low molecular weight anticancer agents can indiscriminately diffuse into normal and cancer tissues throughout the whole body, thereby causing severe systemic side effects. Although traditional approach yielded a few successes it is not a real remedy. Under these circumstances, we see a light in the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect based on pinpoint targeting of the drug to tumor which utilizes a unique characteristic of blood vessels of solid tumors [14–16]. We have studied abnormalities in vascular pathophysiology of solid tumor, in particular, vascular permeability in tumors: abnormal extravasation of macromolecules or lipidic particles, which are then retained in the interstitium of tumor tissues for extended periods, and the EPR effect was thus discovered. The tumor-selective targeting drugs are gaining more attention as one of the most important therapeutic modalities, and thus it becomes one of the hallmark concepts which is applied for cancer drug development. Under these circumstances we witnessed an increase in the number of citations of EPR effect progressively in the past few years (Fig. 1). Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 95 1.4 Proof of Evidence and Forward The best and most efficient utilization of the EPR effect, as an example under clinical setting, is administration of polymeric drug (e.g., SMANCS) into the tumor-feeding artery, e.g., the hepatic artery for hepatoma or the renal artery for renal tumor as oily (Lipiodol 1) formulation [16]. The location of Lipiodol 1, which is iodinated poppy seed oil, can be visualized by CT scan clearly because of its high electron density [16–22]. SMANCS is dissolved in Lipiodol, being a lipophilic drug, and is infused into the blood vessels. SMANCS/Lipiodol 1, being a macromolecular lipid particle, is retained exclusively in tumor very well for prolonged period (Fig. 2A), while very little washout will occur within a few days [19]. As a consequence, the drug concentration of SMANCS/Lipiodol 1 in the tumor is more than 2000-fold of that in the plasma and it remains in tumor for several weeks (Fig. 2A, B) [19]. This approach of SMANCS/Lipiodol 1 injection via the arterial route was demonstrated at first in hepatocellular carcinoma, and SMANCS/Lipodol 1 therapy was approved in 1993 and used for thousands of patients in Japan. The approval of SMANCS for solid tumor heralded the birth of tumor targeting with macromolecular anticancer agents, and led us to discover the EPR effect. Another clinical example is lately obtained using 111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (DTPA)-labeled PEG liposome which clearly showed tumor accumulation [23]. 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 1978 1979 1986 199619951994 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 *Expected (2009) SMANCS synthesis Cancer Research (1986) (Primary Ref for EPR-effect) SMANCS 1st paper (1979)Citation frequency Year of publication Fig. 1 Numbers of citations of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The number has increased progressively in the last few years (provided form Elsevier Science Publisher and THOMSON/ISI) 96 T. Seki et al. Another clinical example of the EPR effect is the gallium scintigraphy. In this case radioactive 67gallium citrate is injected intravenously. Then, 67Ga2+ will bind to plasma protein transferrin (MW 90 kDa) in the blood, thus radioactive (67Ga) transferrin will accumulate in the tumor during next few days by EPR effect. Subsequently, radio-scintigram is obtained 2\u00023 days after injection of 67Ga2+ so as to improve signal/noise ratio. The clearance of 67Ga-transferrin from the normal tissue will take place for a few days via the lymphatic system in contrast to tumor tissue. In this chapter we focus on the pathophysiology and factors involved in the EPR effect in tumor tissues, lymphotropic nature of macromolecular drugs, C AB 1cm Fig. 2 EPR effect and drug accumulation in solid tumor.

CT scan of (A) was obtained 2 days after the initial arterial infusion via a catheter, in which SMANCS/Lipiodol1 was selectively accumulated in the massive carcinoma seen as white area in the liver (due to high electron density of Lipiodol1). After 6 months with intermitted infusions of SMANCS two more times, tumor size (contain- ing SMANCS) has remarkably regressed (B). (C) EPR effect in mouse sarcoma S-180 in mouse skin.

Furthermore, suggestions and future perspectives to utilize this technology for enhanced EPR effect are also dis- cussed. Some examples of potentially promising polymeric anticancer agents under development are also discussed. 2 Mechanisms of the EPR Effect 2.1 Pathophysiology and Architecture of Neovasculature of Cancer Angiogenesis is induced when cluster of tumor cells reach a diameter of 1\u00022 mm: new blood vessel (neovasculature) thus formed is to supply ever increasing demand of cancer cells for nutrients and oxygen [24, 25]. These newly formed blood vessels in tumors are uniquely different from normal blood vessels, i.e., irregular in shape, dilated, fenestra, sinusoids, lack of smooth muscle layer, large gaps in endothelial cell–cell junctions, and lack of or fewer receptors for angiotensin (AT)-II [26–28]. These architectural differences at physioanatomical level can be demonstrated by scanning electron micro- scopy (SEM) shown in Fig. 3A–D vs. E, F. Namely, when water-soluble acrylic monomer that forms polymeric resin was injected into blood vessel, one can Tumor Normal tissues A B C D FE N 100µm Magn 100 Fig. 3 Scanning electron microscope images of blood vessels in normal tissues and blood vessels of tumor. Normal capillary of the pancreas (A), colon (intestinal villi) (B), and liver (sinusoid) (C), and enlarged image of blood capillary of normal liver (D) are shown. (E) Metastatic tumor nodule (area*T ) in the normal liver is shown. (F) Tumor vessels at capillary level (larger magnification) and showing rough surface, and early phase of extravasating vessels (shown by arrows). No leakage of polymer is seen in normal tissues (A–D), whereas tumor-selective extravasation of polymer (by EPR effect) is seen clearly in the tumor nodule (E) 98 T. Seki et al. obtain the plastic cast of the blood vessels. As shown in Fig. 3A–D, capillaries of normal tissues are regularly aligned, and the leakage of plastic polymeric resin is not observed in the normal blood vessels. On the contrary, the polymer is exclusively extravasated outside of blood vessels of tumor nodule (Fig. 3E); tumor nodules are almost filled with polymeric resin (Fig. 3 circled *T area), or it is about to leak out (Fig. 3F). These electron micrograms clearly show completely different vascular features in tumor compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, this is consistent with the observation of tumor-selective extra- vasation of macromolecules (blue albumin) shown in Fig. 2C, and lipidic particle (SMANCS/Lipiodol1) as seen by CT scan in Fig. 2A and B. Thus, the neovasculature having excessive permeability in tumor tissues makes nutrients and oxygen readily available for tumor cells and sustains their rapid growth, while this phenomenon greatly facilitates the accumulation of macromolecular drugs in tumor. Carcinogenesis or tumor metastasis occurs in the normal tissue at first, and the periphery of growing tumor nodule is also the normal tissue. Thus tumor cells need to obtain those nutrients and oxygen from the normal milieu. Under such circumstances many vascular factors, as listed in Table 1, affect the permeability of normal vessels of surrounding tumors and thus sustain tumor growth; these factors in the normal tissue result in the same effect to the EPR effect. Table 1 Factors affecting enhanced permeability and retention effect that influence the accumulation of macromolecular drugs in solid tumors Anatomical or biochemical Unique characteristics and factors Architectural differences and functions h Active angiogenesis and high vascular density h Extensive production of vascular mediators that facilitate extravasation h Defective vascular architecture: Lack of smooth muscle layer Lack of or fewer receptors for angiotensin II Large gap in endothelial cell–cell junctions and fenestration Anomalous conformation of tumor vasculature (e.g., branching or stretching) h Defective lymphatic clearance of macromolecules and lipids from interstitial tissue (prolonged retention of these substances) h Whimsical blood flow and bidirectional blood flow Factors affecting endothelial cell gaps and permeability h Bradykinin (BK) and/or 3-hydroxypropyl BK h Nitric oxide (NO) h Vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) h Prostaglandins (PGE2, PGI2) h Collagenases (matrix metalloproteinases or MMPs) h Peroxynitrite per se, and this activates MMPs h Other proteinases (involving kallikrein system) h Other inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, etc.) Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 99 In addition to the extravasating situation, the lymphatic system of tumor tissue is mostly dysfunctional. As a consequence, once these macromolecules or nanoparticles permeate into tumor tissues, they will be retained there over a long period of time (weeks) [14–22, 29–31]. Under these circumstances the concept of the EPR effect for cancer drug development becomes one of the most important principles for passive targeting to the tumor. However, it is not just a passive targeting. The sustained presence of the drugs in tumor tissue is of critical importance. One can demonstrate passive tumor targeting with a water- soluble contrast agent by angiography infusing via the tumor-feeding artery. During the bolus intraarterial infusion of the contrast agent, series of X-ray pictures are continuously taken, e.g., 10 pictures per second for 10–20 s. Then one can visualize the flow of contract dye from the upstream arteriole to the capillary, then to the venous side. When tumor mass or nodule exists, more densely stained spot or area will appear. This demonstrates passive delivery to tumor; however, this tumor stain will last no more than 10 s. It is a great contrast to the angiographic procedure using Lipodol1-containing SMANCS. Lipiodol 1 will remain more selectively in the tumor for more than several weeks (Fig. 2A, B) [17–20, 31]. This means passive drug targeting alone is not enough which lacks retention as seen in EPR effect. The EPR effect can be observed with macromolecules having apparent molecular size larger than 40–800 kDa [14–22, 29–31], or more to the size of bacteria [32]. Namely, biocompatible polymeric drugs having size larger than the renal clearance threshold (more than 40 kDa) exhibit the EPR effect [14–22]. As stated above, low molecular weight drugs can permeate to tumor tissue, but then they will rapidly diffuse into the circulating blood within a short time, and reaching equilibrium throughout the body. Therefore, it is essentially difficult for these low molecular weight drugs to remain in the tumor tissue unless they have a specific receptor with very high association constant.

Seki et al. 2.2 Factors That Mediate EPR Effect We have extensively studied these vascular mediators and generation of such mediator triggered by cancer cells directly or indirectly. It is interesting to note that they are common to inflammatory mediators; consequently, one can observe that cancer is like inflammation that never ceases but grows. 2.2.1 Bradykinin (kinin) We had initially identified that bradykinin (BK) was generated in all bacterial infections [33–35]. An intrinsic proteolytic cascade system yields BK and this system is triggered by microbial proteases. BK is an important mediator of hyperalgesia, inflammatory reaction, asthma, pain, increased vascular perme- ability, and vasodilatation. Hageman factor (or factor XII) of coagulation cascade is the uppermost protease of the kallikrein–kinin system. Activation of factor XII is followed by activation of prekallikrein to kallikrein. Kallikrein generates BK directly from kininogen. BK is the most potent pain-inducing peptide in plasma with half-life of a few second which is constantly generated at the site of infection and will facilitate vascular permeability in the tissue. It is interesting to note that many tumors, if not all, induce pain, and it is another physiological effect of BK associated with inflammation, infection, and cancer (Fig. 5). In other words, BK is a common mediator between cancer and inflammation. We demonstrated that BK is an important mediator of EPR effect in cancer [36]. Figure 5 shows network of BK and other mediators involving in EPR effect. BK interacts with various proinflammatory factors involving vascular perme- ability. For instance, it is also known to activate endothelial cell-type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is one of the primary enzymes to produce NO from L-arginine. We have reported that the BK-generating cascade is activated in tumor tissues [36]. More importantly, malignant ascetic and pleural fluids would be caused by activation of kallikrein–kinin system in carcinomatosis [37]. BK is degraded by many peptidases, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE inhibitor can thus block kinin degeneration as well as AT-II formation (hence resulting in blood lowering effect). BK in most cancer patients, if not all cases, contains hydroxyproline at the third position in place of proline, and both BK and 3-hydroxyprolyl-BK are liberated from kininogen by kallikrein [38]. Both Bhoola’s and our groups reported the presence of excessive levels of BK receptor (B2) in various human and rodent solid tumors [39, 40], which would affect the EPR effect (Fig. 5). 2.2.2 Nitric Oxide Nitric oxide (NO) is generated by three isoforms of NOS, and the most potent isoform is inducible-type NOS (iNOS) which is produced in macrophages and Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 101 neutrophiles. These leukocytes are known to infiltrate into tumor tissues exten- sively. One of the most important physiological functions of NO, mediated by NO-cGMP signaling, is vasorelaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and hence lowering of the blood pressure. NO also influences tumor vascular permeability and plays a crucial role as a mediator of the EPR effect in solid tumor [41, 42]. As an evidence, NOS inhibitors, N o-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and N o-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME), as well as NO scavenger, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO), suppressed the vascular permeability in solid tumors [41–43].

Seki et al. contribution of NO in EPR effect was quantified by scavenging NO using PTIO and analyzed according to tumor size, the extent of EPR effect, based on uptake of Evans blue albumin, was found proportionally dependent on the tumor size up to 0.25 g. Further increase in tumor size leads to the decreased contribution of NO in EPR effect. This means NO may play more important role at early phase of tumor growth (Fig. 6). Meyer et al. also found that NOS inhibitor irreversibly attenuated blood flow in R3230Ac rat mammary adenocarcinoma [44]. Similarly, Tozer et al. demon- strated a selective reduction in tumor blood flow with another NOS inhibitor, N o-nitro-L-arginine in P22 tumor-bearing rats [45]. In different context we Contribution to NO Fig. 6 NO-dependent vascular permeability of solid tumors (S-180) as quantified by uptake of Evans blue albumin complex in tumor of various sizes in mice. Mice were administered with NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) orally (dose: PTIO, 125 mg/kg I´ 4 in 8 h). Note that EPR effect is greatly suppressed by PTIO, which is a fraction of NO contributing to EPR effect. Further note that when the tumor size is larger than 0.25 g, the contribution of NO in EPR effect is less pronounced. This implicates the importance of NO at the early stages of tumor growth (see text) (from [42] after modification) Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 103 further identified its involvement of NO in collagenase activation for EPR effect. Namely, NO reacts rapidly with superoxide anion, which is predominantly produced by leukocytes, to generate peroxynitrite (ONOO \u0002). ONOO \u0002 can acti- vate precursors of matrix metalloproteinase (proMMP) to become MMP by oxidizing zinc-cystein switch of proMMP [46]. Proteases in tumor are known to contribute to tumor growth and metastasis, and MMPs play an important role in tumor metastasis [47, 48]. On the other hand, ONOO \u0002 per se and the subse- quently activated MMP also appear to contribute to EPR effect [49, 50]. 2.2.3 VEGF Vascular endothelial cell-derived growth factor (VEGF) was previously identi- fied as the vascular permeability factor (VPF) by Dvorak et al. [51, 52]. Table 2 shows quantification of VEGF in various tumors and normal tissues in mice [50]. The amount of VEGF in tumor was 2- to 30- fold higher than that of normal tissues with the exception of the lung.

[36] 104 T. Seki et al. Regarding the involvement of VEGF in EPR effect, we examined the extra- vasation of Evans blue in guinea pig skin by intradermally injecting VEGF as well as BK. VEGF like BK significantly enhanced the extravasation of Evans blue (albumin) in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, VEGF may also play an important role in the EPR effect [50]. 2.2.4 Others Inducible form of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), which is also induced by inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a,IL-1b, IL-8, etc.), can increase the genera- tion of prostaglandins (PGs) (PGE2, PGI2, etc.), thus enhancing the EPR effect [41, 43, 53]. 3 Development of EPR Effect: Past and Future 3.1 Background Based on the EPR effect it is now possible to achieve very high local drug concentrations in tumor using macromolecular size drugs, i.e., polymer con- jugates, micellar or liposomal drugs, or nanomedicine [14–16, 30, 31, 54–58]. Plasma proteins with molecular weight larger than 40 kDa such as non- antibody IgG can also exhibit high tumor targeting efficiency [14, 15, 59]. Initially, Maeda et al. conjugated an antitumor protein neocarzinostatin (NCS, MW 12 kDa) with copolymer of styrene–maleic acid–half-n-butylate (SMA) [59–61]. The conjugation of protein (NCS) with SMA called SMANCS 353 35.3 3.53 300 30 3 Back- groundBK (µg) VEGF(ng)Evans blue (µg) 0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Fig. 7 Enhanced vascular permeability induced by exogenous BK and VEGF in normal guinea pig dorsal skin.

Accordingly, SMANCS exhibited much improved physicochemical, biochemical, and pharmacological properties than parental NCS, and most importantly, it also behaved in a tumor-selective manner in vivo [30, 59]. 3.2 Augmentation of EPR Effect: Development for Future 3.2.1 Under Angiotensin (AT)-II-Induced Hypertension The anatomical architecture of blood vessels of tumor is quite different from that of normal tissue as described above. Normal blood vessels maintain vascular blood flow volume constant regardless of the blood pressure applied by a homeostatic mechanism. Namely, when hypertension is induced by vas- cular mediators, i.e., vasoconstrictor AT-II, the blood vessels will constrict resulting in higher blood pressure, accompanying faster velocity of blood flow per area of cross section in normal vasculature. The cross section being now smaller, the blood flow volume thus remains constant [62, 63]. Contrary to normal vasculature, there is no homeostatic blood flow regulation in the tumor vasculature. In 1981, Suzuki et al. found that raising the systolic blood pressure by infusing AT-II into tumor-bearing rats caused a selective increase of blood flow volume in tumor about 2- to 6-fold; the degree of increase depends on the induced blood pressure [62]. We thus anticipated that the EPR effect could be augmented by AT-II- induced hypertensive state, thereby increasing macromolecular drug delivery. 51Cr-labeled SMANCS or other putative macromolecular drug (bovine serum albumin, 14C-BSA) was infused i.v. into the rats bearing tumor, followed by immediate infusion of AT-II via i.v. route, thus elevating the systolic blood pressure from 100 to 150 mmHg, which was maintained for 15 min. We found the accumulation of both radioactive BSA and SMANCS increased in tumor tissues to 1.3- to 3-fold [64]. In contrast to tumor, the amount of these drugs delivered to normal organs such as kidney, intestine, and bone marrow was reduced because of the vasoconstriction (tightening of endothelial cell gap junction). Namely, the extravasation of nanoparticle size larger than 40 kDa in normal tissues was more suppressed due to tighter endothelial intercellular junction. Consequently, less damage was found in the bone marrow and the intestine as judged by the bone marrow cellularity and the degree of diarrhea [64]. It should also be noted that conventional low molecular weight anticancer agents are not applicable to this strategy due to the rapid washout. In normo- tensive state, it is difficult to achieve more than 2- to 3-fold higher tumor delivery by increasing the dose due to dose-limiting toxicity. However, it now becomes possible by AT-II-induced hypertensive state. Therefore, the AT-II- induced hypertensive state makes it possible to achieve a significantly higher 106 T. Seki et al. tumor-selective accumulation without increase in the drug dosage. Conse- quently, a better therapeutic effect was observed clinically by using this method for SMANCS/Lipiodol1 (e.g., SMANCS dynamic therapy), which is adminis- tered intraarterially against cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic liver cancer, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma [21, 22, 30]. As expected, the present procedure showed much fewer side effects. 3.2.2 Local Increase of Bradykinin Level by ACE Inhibitor Maeda’s group demonstrated that inhibition of ACE by systemic administra- tion of ACE inhibitors caused local increase of BK levels at the tumor site, because BK generation was occurring exclusively in tumor tissue unless inflam- mation existed elsewhere. ACE inhibitors are benign and commonly used as antihypertensive agents, and they do not affect normotensive patients. Most of them are orally administered and show very long plasma half-life (>4 h). On the basis of these data, we used the ACE inhibitors enalapril and temocapril to inhibit BK degradation and showed that the elevated BK level resulted in further enhancement of vascular permeability or the EPR effect [36, 41]. ACE inhibitors thus increased the delivery of macromolecular drugs to tumors, even in normotensive patients. Experimental and clinical effects to enhance both drug delivery and the antitumor effects by use of ACE inhibitor need to be validated along this line using macromolecular drugs. 3.2.3 By Using Prostacyclin Agonists Prostaglandins (PGs) are formed by cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), and PGEs production is markedly elevated in human and experimental tumors [66, 67]. We showed that COX inhibitor, indomethacin, significantly suppressed vascular permeability in S-180 and other solid tumor models [41]. In addition, we found that injection of beraprost sodium, a stable prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) agonist, which has much longer in vivo t1/2 than PGI2(60 min vs. a few seconds), resulted in about 2-fold enhancement of the EPR effect, similar to the situation for ACE inhibitors [53, 65]. As an incidental finding, beraprost reduced down- stream blood flow to an almost negligible degree (about 10%) while enhancing vascular leakage of tumor [53]. As a consequence, macromolecular tumor- imaging agents may be further concentrated in tumor tissues by combination with beraprost, although this possibility must be demonstrated in clinical settings. 3.2.4 Increasing NO Concentration in Tumor by Use of NO-Releasing Agents We found that the NO-releasing agent isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN, Nitrol 1) enhanced antitumor activity of SMANCS/Lipiodol 1 when they were infused into the tumor-feeding bronchial artery of lung cancer using a catheter preced- ing to the infusion of SMANCS arterially. This ISDN infusion enhanced Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 107 opening of the feeding artery, followed by increase of blood flow; thus, more drugs were delivered in the tumor as revealed by CT scan image [22]. This enhanced vascular flow may also ameliorate the state of hypoxia, followed by suppressing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1a), which will otherwise induce angiogenesis and tumor growth. Further, it may also suppress the production of VEGF since HIF-1a is known to induce VEGF. Recently, we found that EPR effect is further enhanced by applying nitro- glycerin ointment onto the skin of superficial tumors including breast cancer induced by chemical carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in rats, and also transplanted mice tumors (Seki and Maeda, in preparation). The increase of Evans blue/albumin delivered into the solid tumors was 2- to 3-fold of that without nitroglycerin [68]. 4 Important Issues on Nanomedicine: Intracellular Uptake of Macromolecular Drugs, Drug Release Rate from the Complex, and Drug Resistance 4.1 Access to Tumor and Intracellular Uptake, and to the Molecular Target Two major steps in drug delivery are commonly considered: first step is the tissue vascular level (organ), accomplished by EPR effect for polymer thera- peutics (nanomedicine) which can traverse the vascular wall to the tumor interstitium, where EPR effect plays the single most important role [69]. Second step is to reach to the molecular target after binding to cell mem- brane, followed by internalization across the cell membrane. This can be better accomplished more frequently by a specific receptor/ligand binding followed by internalization, which is possible with specific antigenic site using antibody, or the ligands (agonists) and receptor, or the unique probe molecules, respectively. Even without a unique or specific epitope receptor, the endocytotic mechanism for macromolecules would take place more generally. Subsequently, free diffu- sion of low molecular weight drugs would proceed after release from micelles or liposomes at the vicinity of molecular target in the tumor cells or tumor tissues. 4.1.1 Free Drug Diffusion A significant distance will be covered by free diffusion, for both low and high molecular weight drugs to access tumor cells after extravasating from blood vessels. This non-static/dynamic state in biological in vivo system should not be overlooked. For instance, distance of diffusion of IgG (MW 160 kDa) can be easily detected several millimeters during overnight incubation at room tem- perature in the classic agar immuno-diffusion experiment. Also in antibiotic drug assays using agar plate, we routinely observed the mobility of about 10 mm 108 T. Seki et al. or more in the agar diffusion of antibiotics overnight. Therefore whatever the mechanism, biologically active molecules can reach about 10–100 mm distance easily to tumor cells outside the capillary in the interstitial matrix of tumor tissue and get access to tumor cells within the distance of free diffusion. 4.1.2 Cellular Uptake Macromolecular drugs are less likely to traverse into cells by simple diffusion across cell membranes because of their size; therefore, endocytosis (fluid- phase endocytosis or pinocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, phagocyto- sis, transcytosis) appears to be the usual means of internalization [70–72]. Efficient endocytotic internalization occurs after specific binding to receptors (upregulation of receptor). It is well known that many receptors such as transferrin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and folate are highly upregulated on tumor cells and corresponding ligand-linked drugs will be effectively internalized to the tumor [73, 74]. In this connection it is known that dividing tumor cells have more active intracellular uptake (endocytosis) than non- dividing cells [75], indicating a higher uptake efficiency of macromolecular drugs by dividing cancer cells. 4.1.3 Access to Submolecular Target This offers another step of selectivity. After internalization of the drugs into the cytoplasm via phagosomes, the phagosomes fuse with lysosomes, which are rich in proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., rich in cathepsin B in tumor [76]), of which low pH optimum fits to that of tumor tissue (pH 5.5–6.5) rather than normal tissues. Then active principle is hydrolysed and released in this milieu. This confers the third step of advantage. Therefore, for many pendant-type linked drugs, the types of chemical bonds become important: the peptidyl linkers must be selected to facilitate easy cleavage in cancer cells to fit the substrate requirement of a specific cathepsin or other specific enzymes [77–79]. For example, linker cleaved by cathepsin B is ideal, which is probably the case of OPAXIOTM (Xylotax, CT-2103). In this case, polyglutamyl car- boxyl group is linked to 20-hydroxyl of paclitaxel by ester linkage. In the case of SMANCS, it is essentially taken up into the cell by endocytosis, and acidic pH (<6) of phago-lysosome liberates the active component (NCS) by spontaneous hydrolysis of the maleylamide bond. Then chromophore of NCS diffuses into the cytoplasm or to the nucleus, where the drug action to DNA would occur [70, 71]. Another acid-labile bond is azide bond which is discussed by other researchers [80]. In our SMA micelles of pirarubicin or doxorubicin constant release of the anthracycline from micelles was observed, the rate was much slower than the endocytotic process, which showed a release rate of 4–5%/day. In these cases, once the micelles are taken up into the tumor cells, active principle of free drugs will be continuously released. However, pirarubicin, which exhibits higher Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 109 intracellular uptake than doxorubicin [81], resulted in better therapeutic effect than doxorubicin [81, 82]. Some micellar drugs exhibiting too fast (e.g., NK911 [83]) or too slow (e.g., Doxil1 [84]) release rates will potentially affect their side effect or anticancer effect. 4.2 Against Multidrug Resistance In a different context, after intracellular uptake of macromolecular drugs, P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-dependent efflux system of multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells is not operative for macromolecular drugs [85–89]. This result suggests that EPR-mediated targeting of polymeric anticancer drugs cannot be nullified by Pgp-dependent system until it becomes free drug such as doxorubicin, thus ensuring higher intracellular activity against MDR-positive cancer cells. As another advantage of nanomedicine for managing MDR problem, Minko et al. reported that HPMA-block copolymer-doxorubicin conjugated circumvent MDR issue by modulating intracellular signaling leading to apop- tosis in MDR cells [88, 89]. 5 Recent Developments of Macromolecular Anticancer Agents for Tumor-Targeted Delivery Utilizing EPR Effect: Potential Drugs for Future 5.1 OPAXIOTM, Poly(L-Glutamic Acid)-Paclitaxel Conjugates Paclitaxel (PTX) is a conventional anticancer agent for various cancers such as tumors of the ovary, the breast, and the lung. The drug was first isolated in 1967, and approved by FDA for ovarian cancer in 1992. However, the major difficulty in the clinical application of PTX was poor water solubility and usual toxicity of neutropenia and peripheral sensory neuropathy. To overcome these problems, Li et al. developed a conjugate of poly(L-glutamic acid) and PTX via ester bonds (OPAXIO TM, formerly known as XYOTAX, CT-2103) [90]. The conjugate has a molecular weight of approximately 49 kDa, containing 35% of PTX (w/w), and exhibits prolonged plasma and tumor half-life. It is taken up by endocytosis and free PTX is liberated by cathepsin B cleavage. Further, OPAXIO TM exhibited greater antitumor activity against both murine tumors and human tumor xeno- grafts compared to PTX [90, 91]. Phase III trials were performed in patients with non-smallcelllung cancer(NSCLC).OPAXIO TM showed significant decrease of many side effects, such as alopecia, infection, and cardiac symptoms, compared to PTX (control), and exhibited 40% improvement of overall survival compared to vinorelbine which is used for comparison group in the treatment of NSCLC, and it was recently approved by EU Medicines Agency. 110 T. Seki et al. 5.2 NK012, SN-38-Encapsulated Micelles 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38) is an active principle of irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11) generated by hydrolysis of carboxy esterase. SN-38 exhibits up to 1000-fold more potent cytotoxic activity against various cancer cells in vitro than CPT-11 [92]. Although camptothecin exhibited antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo in experimental studies, it is used only in limited extent clinically because of its low therapeutic efficacy and severe side effect including severe diarrhea and liver toxicity [93, 94]. Although SN-38 per se showed a potent antitumor activity, it is not soluble in water, the same problem as PTX. To overcome this problem, SN-38-loaded polymeric micelle (NK012) was developed by the self-assembly of an amphiphilic block copoly- mer which consists of PEG and partially modified polyglutamate [95]. NK012 has molecular weight of 19 kDa and a mean particle size of 20 nm in diameter, and contained about 20% (w/w) of SN-38 in the micelle. The releasing rates of SN-38 in 5% glucose solution at 378C were 1 and 3% at 24 and 48 h, respec- tively. Therefore, NK012 is stable in micelle under physiological condition, and is expected to show the EPR effect. Further, it showed potent cytotoxicity 43- to 340-fold higher than that of CPT-11 in various tumor cells and 2.3- to 5.8-fold higher than that of free SN-38 in various cells in vitro. NK012 showed more potent antitumor activity than CPT-11 in vivo against two human small cell lung cancer cell lines, SBC/Neo and SBC/VEGF in human xenograft mice models [96]. Phase I study of the NK012 is now undergoing in Japan. 5.3 NK105, Paclitaxel-Encapsulated Micelle NK105 was developed by Kataoka et al. in early 1990s, designed to utilize the EPR effect [97, 98]. NK105 is a block copolymer micelle composed of PEG and polyaspartate. The polymer has a molecular weight of approximately 20 kDa, and contains 23% of PTX (w/w). NK105 dramatically improved aforementioned toxicity problems. Further, NK105 exhibited slower clearance from the plasma than PTX, and remained in plasma up to 72 h, whereas free PTX was not detected 24 h after injection. The antitumor effect of NK105 is more potent than that of PTX, while body weight loss was not observed in the mice by administration of NK105 at 100 mg/kg (PTX equivalent). These encouraging experimental results in vivo led to clinical trials currently under Phase II study in Japan [99, 100]. 5.4 NC6004, Cisplatin-Encapsulated Micelle and MBP-426, Oxaliplatin Containing Transferrin-Coated Stealth Liposomes cis-Dichlorodiammineplatinum (II) (cisplatin, CDDP) is an important agent in cancer chemotherapy. Polymeric micelle containing CDDP utilizing EPR effect Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 111 was also developed by Kataoka et al. in early 1990s [101, 102]. Similar to the development of NK105, NC6004 is a micellar drug which consists of PEG- poly(glutamic acid) block copolymer encapsulating CDDP. The micelle has a molecular weight of 18 kDa, and a mean distribution size of 30 nm [101]. The micelles are stable and the release rates of CDDP from NC6004 were 19.6 and 47.8% at 24 and 96 h, respectively. NC6004 showed significant tumor growth suppression in the human gastric cancer xenograft mice, while it did not induce decrease of body weight in contrast to CDDP at 5 mg/kg. Phase I clinical trial of NC6004 is now undergoing in the UK and will be started soon in the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan [101]. Maruyama et al. developed transferrin-targeted PEG-stealth liposome [103] containing trans-L-diaminocyclohexane oxalatoplatinum (oxaliplatin), MBP-426, and designed to utilize EPR effect as well as transferrin receptor which is highly expressed on tumor cells, for active targeting. The size of transferrin-PEG-liposome is about 180 nm in diameter, and it contains oxaliplatin of 14.8 mg/mg liposomal lipid [104]. The transferrin-liposome showed about 16-fold more tumor accumulation than parent-free oxaliplatin in colon 26 tumor at 30 h after injection [104]. Further, it remained about 2-fold higher in concentration in tumor at 72 h after i.v. than that of liposome without transferrin. The transferrin-PEG-liposome at 5 mg/kg oxaliplatin equivalent suppressed colon 26 tumor growth significantly compared to free oxaliplatin (about 80% suppression) and the liposome without transferrin [104]. Phase I clinical study is currently undergoing in the USA. 5.5 Camptothecin Conjugates Camptothecin is a potent cytotoxic agent first isolated from plant Camptotheca accuminata. Besides low specificity to tumor cells as many other low-MW anticancer drugs, camptothecin possesses two major drawbacks: weak solubi- lity in water and a high affinity for human serum albumin via a reaction that renders the drug inactive. 20(S)-camptothecin contains a lactone ring that is essential for cytotoxic effect and binding to topoisomerase I. The camptothecin usually exists in equilibrium with lactone ring and open-ended carboxylate form, which reacts with human albumin at physiological pH, then the drug is converted into the inactive form. Similar to the modification of free PTX for OPAXIOTM, camptothecin was conjugated with poly-L-glutamatic acid, which made it soluble in water as well as stabilization of the labile lactone ring, so that the conjugate could benefit from EPR effect. Indeed, this conjugate showed improved pharmacokinetics and higher intratumor accumulation as a result of the EPR effect [101]. A Phase I/II study is now underway in the USA and Europe. This conjugate offers a marked advantage compared with free camp- tothecin as are other polymeric drugs. 112 T. Seki et al. 5.6 PEG- and SMA-Conjugated Zinc Protoporphyrin IX Zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) shows specific inhibition of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is also known as heat shock protein 32 (Hsp32). HO-1 plays a key role in regulating the intracellular heme level by catalyzing initial oxidation of heme to generate billiverdin, carbon oxide (CO), and free iron, which is the rate-limiting step of heme degradation. Billiverdin will further be converted to bilirubin by billiverdin reductase. Bilirubin is one of the most potent antiox- idants which cancer cells utilize, and CO is now known as an important anti- oxidative and anti-apoptotic molecule. Consequently, induction of HO-1 (or Hsp32) parallels to the anti-apoptotic and proliferative activity of cancer cells. HO-1 (Hsp32) is thus referred as a survival factor of cancer cells. All neoplastic cells we tested found high expression of HO-1 mRNA and HO-1 protein, including experimental solid tumors as well as leukemic cells [105–109]. There- fore, HO-1 may be a good anticancer target, and its inhibitor, such as ZnPP, would be a good candidate of a new anticancer strategy. Indeed, we demon- strated ZnPP has potent antitumor activity in vivo. [107, 110] However, the problem is that ZnPP is not readily water soluble. Therefore, we developed a water-soluble PEG-conjugated ZnPP (PZP). In another series of experiments we prepared SMA micelles containing ZnPP (SZP). Both PZP and SZP showed high tumor targeting and antitumor effect [107, 110, 111]. Obviously, these polymeric drugs achieved tumor-targeted delivery based on EPR effect. Thus, inhibition of the enzyme HO-1 with PZP in tumor would result in marked increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), or the oxystress in tumor cells that would lead to apoptosis and marked antitumor effects [107, 109]. In combination with ROS, PZP pretreatment suppressed tumor growth in mice more significantly [111]. Further combination with other anticancer agents such as [111] showed additive or synergistic antitumor effect with PZP pretreatment compared with either treatment alone. In addition to oxystress/apoptosis hypothesis induced by PZP, Peter Valent et al. [105, 112, 113] showed remarkable downregulation of oncogene BCR/ ABL in CML which led to apoptosis. PZP or SZP exhibits also growth suppressing effect on imanitib-resistant CML as well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [105, 112–114]. These findings suggest that HO-1 (Hsp-32) is an attractive target for chemotherapeutic intervention for combination therapy. We recently found that SZP and PZP generated singlet oxygen, another ROS, upon xenon light (>400 nm) irradiation [115, 116] and consequently exhibited cytotoxic effect in Jurkat cells and KYSE (human esophageal carci- noma cells) in vitro [115], and S-180 tumor growth and DMBA-induced breast cancer in rodents upon irradiation of conventional endoscopic light [116]. Because of its unique tumoritropic nature by EPR and singlet oxygen genera- tion by endoscopic xenon light, the anticancer effect of PZP and SZP will become 2- to 3-fold interesting, and will be applicable for all GI cancers Tumor-Targeted Macromolecular Drug Delivery 113 including esophageal, and superficial cancers, such as breast, skin, broncho- genic, urinary, and cervical cancers. 6 Conclusions Discovery of EPR effect represents a major milestone in the history of cancer targeting chemotherapy. EPR effect is commonly observed for macromolecular drugs in most of solid tumors, and thus this spontaneous tumor targeting character of macromolecular drugs makes great breakthrough. Various pro- mising macromolecular drugs have been developed based on the EPR effect [54– 58, 100, 107], and they showed greatly improved characteristics, such as prolonged half-life in plasma and tumor, lesser systemic toxicity, and increased distribution to tumor, accompanied by prolonged retention in the tumor tis- sues. We expect that EPR effect-based targeting of anticancer drugs ensure a better QOL, improved compliance of patients as well as low manufacturing cost, which is more critically discussed recently [10]. EPR effect can be augmented by modulating blood pressure and increase of local blood flow using AT-II-induced hypertension in most solid tumors and NO-releasing agent (ISDN or GTN) in the lung and ductal cancer and super- ficial cancer and others. Thus, the delivery of macromolecular drugs will be increased further 1.5- to 3-fold. Accordingly improved efficacy will be war- ranted. Therefore, augmentation of the EPR effect-dependent macromolecular drugs delivery to tumor will be an important strategy for cancer therapy in future. Taken together, we believe the EPR effect-based drugs design and its artifi- cial augmentation will open up new door for future cancer chemotherapy.

Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal Ho Lun Wong, Xiao Yu Wu, and Reina Bendayan 1 Introduction Chemotherapy was first used for the treatment of advanced lymphomas in the 1940s [1]. Since then several classes of chemotherapeutic compounds such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, plant alkaloids, and later topoisomerase inhibitors and taxanes have been identified or synthesized to treat various forms of cancer [2, 3]. Although numerous in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in inducing cancer cell death (cytotoxic) or cell growth arrest (cytostatic), these promising anticancer activ- ities seen in the controlled environment of the laboratory frequently do not translate well into the expected clinical outcomes [4–8]. Some cancer types such as hepatocellular cancer and thyroid cancer basically do not respond to chemotherapy [9]. These cancers are intrinsically drug- resistant. For most of the other cancer types, chemotherapy is occasionally curative when the cancers are still in the early stage and remain localized, but once the diseases progress into the advanced stage and metastasize, the cure rates will significantly decline [9, 10]. This is particularly true for solid tumors including prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, osteosarcoma, and head and neck cancers. For example, the 10-year survival rate for localized prostate cancer (stage A1) was estimated as 95%, whereas fewer than 1% of patients with stage D2 (metastasized) will be cured [10]. A similar trend is seen in the node-negative breast cancer patients, in which chemotherapy produced an absolute survival benefit of 5.7%, which drops to 2.3% when the cancer spreads to the lymph nodes, and when the cancer becomes metastatic, it is essentially incurable [11]. These cancers can acquire drug resistance during the course of treatment. In order to develop effective strategies to overcome the drug resistance, its underlying mechanisms must be identified and understood. H.L.

MDR in cancer is defined as the cross-resistance or insensitivity of cancer cells to the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of a broad spectrum of anticancer compounds which are structurally or functionally distinct and have different molecular targets [12]. The first correla- tion between this phenomenon and membrane drug transporters was established in mid-1970s [13], and later these membrane-bound transporters were purified and shown to be the members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter super- family [14, 15]. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is the first and probably most characterized ABC transporter that is related to the MDR phenotype. By causing efflux of drug molecules from cancer cells, P-gp can effectively lower the intracellular drug concentration and protect the cells from the drug actions [16, 17]. The discovery of this P-gp-mediated ‘‘classical’’ MDR phenotype quickly triggered extensive research in this field, and it was soon found that other ABC transporters such as multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) [18] and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [19] also contribute to drug resistance in a similar manner. Meanwhile, more alternative drug resistance mechanisms in cancer were revealed. The majority of these mechanisms involve dysfunctional or altered molecular pathways which lead to diminished anticancer drug effects [20–22]. Table 1 provides an update of some of these mechanisms and the therapeutic agents for overcoming these forms of resistance. In this chapter, our focus will be on the ABC transporter mechanism. In order to overcome MDR, chemical entities that reverse the MDR mechanisms mainly by inhibition of the ABC transporter functions, sometimes known as ‘‘chemosensitizers’’ or ‘‘MDR rever- sal agents’’ [23], have been discovered or designed with the purpose to restore the sensitivity of cancer to chemotherapy. Although promising findings were obtained with some of these compounds, in general this class of drugs is less effective than expected. However, with better understanding of cancer biology such as the role of cancer progenitor/stem cells, and the tremendous advances made in the development of novel therapeutics such as nanomedicine and molecular targeting strategies in the past few years [22, 23], there are strong signs indicating the revival of the interest in MDR reversal treatment. 2 Multidrug Resistance Mediated by ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) Transporters 2.1 ABC Transporters – Classification, Structure, and Drug Efflux Mechanism The ABC transporter superfamily consists of a variety of transmembrane proteins, many of them responsible for the transport of diverse classes of substrates that include not only anticancer drug molecules but also lipids, sterols, polypeptides, ions, and metabolic products across extracellular and 122 H.L. Wong et al. intracellular membranes [24]. They have been shown to play several physiological and pathological roles. In addition to cancer MDR, these transporters are also implicated in bacterial drug resistance, cystic fibrosis, and a number of inherited diseases [14]. So far 50 human ABC transporter members have been identified [25, 26]. Human Genome Organization classified these transporters into seven families based on the organization and sequence of their ATP-binding domain(s), also known as nucleotide-binding folds. Table 2 shows a list of human ABC transpor- ters involved in MDR and their chemotherapeutic drug substrates. Overall, all ABC transporters contain one or two ATP-binding domains located at the cytosolic side of the membranes and one or two transmembrane domains, each consists of 6–11 a-helices spanning across the phospholipids bilayer of the membrane several times [27, 28]. Ligand-binding site is found between the transmembrane domains. Recent studies have revealed the pre- sence of several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABC transporter genes [29, 30]. However, the significance of these findings is not precisely known. ABC transporters are also sometimes classified into full transporters or half Table 1 Cellular drug resistance mechanisms Type of drug resistance Mechanism Therapeutic agents to overcome drug resistance Increased cellular drug efflux Overexpression of ABC transporters, e.g., P-gp, MRP1, BCRP MDR reversal agents (e.g., PSC833, XR9576, GG918) Apoptosis evasion Reduced sphingolipid ceramide generation or enhanced ceramide metabolism Ceramide generation activator (e.g., gefitinib); ceramide metabolism inhibitors (e.g., LCL204, N-oleoylethanolamine) Increased level of surviving Antisense oligonucleotide Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bcl-2 inhibitor (e.g., ABT-737), antisense therapy (e.g., Genasense G3139) Increased survival signaling Overexpressed and aberrantly activated EGFR EGFR antibody (e.g., mAb-C225), antisense oligonucleotide Sustained or altered Wnt signaling Anti-Wnt antibody Activated hedgehog signaling pathway SMO inhibitor cyclopamine BCR-ABL expression Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., Imatinib, dasatinib) Drug detoxification Overexpression of glutathione S-transferase g-Glutamylcysteine synthetase Altered drug target Mutation of tubulin Not known Enhanced DNA repair Increased level of O6- alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase Not known ABC, ATP-binding cassette; BCRP, breast cancer resistance protein; MRP1, multidrug resistance-associated proteins 1; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; Wnt, Wingless signaling pathway. Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 123 transporters. A full ABC transporter consists of two transmembrane domains and two ATP-binding domains, whereas a half transporter consists of only one of each [26]. Because two transmembrane domains and two ATP-binding domains are required for a transporter to be functional, half transporters need to form dimers to gain functionality. The mechanism of drug transport by the ABC transporters has not been fully elucidated. It is known that when an ATP molecule binds to the ATP-binding domains, ATP hydrolysis occurs and a conformational change in these domains is induced. This change is eventually communicated to the transmembrane domains to alter the translocation pathway, so substrate transport is achieved [31–36]. However, how this series of events exactly happen is not completely known. Some groups hypothesized that an ABC transporter allows drug molecules to be transported through a central pore, but recent lines of evidence suggested that these transporters may more likely act like a hydrophobic ‘‘vacuum cleaner’’ or ‘‘flippase’’ [34, 35]. In this proposed scheme, substrate molecules crossing the membrane are intercepted by the transporters inside the phospholipid bilayers and ‘‘flipped’’ back to outside. It should be noted that this is an active process driven by the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. ABC transporters are therefore able to create and maintain a thermodynamically unfavorable concentration gradient of their drug substrates across the cell membrane, and allow cancer cells overexpressing them to maintain a relatively drug-free intracellular environment duringchemotherapy(see Fig. 1 for the scheme illustrating these events).

Wong et al. 2.2 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Among all ABC transporters, P-gp, also known as MDR1 protein, ABCB1 or CD243, is probably the most studied and characterized member. It was first found as a 170-kDa ATP-dependent membrane glycoprotein that acts as a drug efflux pump [15]. P-gp is a broad-spectrum transporter, capable of transporting several structurally and functionally unrelated substrate molecules. Its substrates are typically hydrophobic, amphipathic products, including many chemotherapeutic compounds used for cancer treatment, e.g., vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide, teniposide), anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin), topotecan, dactinomycin, and mitomycin-C [37]. Although P-gp is best known for its contribution to MDR in cancer, this transporter is also recognized for its involvement in a variety of physiological functions, including removal of toxic metabolites and xenobiotics from healthy tissues into bile, intestinal lumen, and urine, maintenance of the barrier function of a number of sanctuary site tissues such as blood–brain barrier (BBB), placenta, and blood–testis barrier, and protection of hemato- poietic stem cells from harmful substances [38–42]. In addition, P-gp was also found on the nuclear envelope and the membranes of several cytoplasmic organelles (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus) in both normal and cancer cells [43, 44]. It is possible that these P-gp transporters may regulate the intracellular distribution of drug molecules, e.g., sequestration of anticancer drug molecules from important cell organelles to give the cancer cells additional drug resistance.

There are two possible ways substrates can be pumped out: substrates that enter the cytosolic compartment may be pumped out through the pore of the transporter (dashed line) or they may be intercepted by the pump in the lipid bilayer and flipped out (solid line). Hydrolysis of ATP provides the energy required for the drug efflux against the substrate concentration gradient across the membrane. Only the transmembrane domains and ATP-binding domains are shown in this scheme Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 125 Experimental and clinical evidence points to the significance of P-gp in MDR. Mouse fibroblasts lacking functional P-gp were several times (3- to 16-fold) more sensitive to paclitaxel, anthracyclines, and vinca alkaloids than the P-gp-expres- sing parental cells [45]. Meanwhile, overexpression of P-gp is generally asso- ciated with increased cancer drug resistance. In humans, P-gp is the product of MDR1 gene. Transfection of drug-sensitive, wild-type cancer cells with MDR1 gene can lead to the subline manifesting MDR phenotype (e.g., drug-sensitive MDA435 human breast cancer cells into drug-resistant MDA435/LCC6/ MDR1 subline) [46]. It was shown that the MDR phenotype conferred by P-gp may be intrinsic or acquired. In epithelial cells of liver, colon, adrenal, pancreas, and kidneys, P-gp is normally expressed without previous exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. This ultimately results in the high basal levels of multidrug resistance in the cancers which affect these organs [9, 37, 47]. Genetic changes resulting in amplification of the MDR1 gene may also be rapidly induced by exposure to high doses of chemotherapeutic drugs [48]. Alterna- tively, P-gp upregulation can be induced by prolonged exposure to suboptimal drug levels, or according to the ‘‘clonal selection’’ theory, it may also favor the proliferation of P-gp-overexpressing cells under the stress of cytotoxic drug exposure [49–51]. 2.3 Other ABC Transporters Related to MDR In addition to P-gp, there are other ABC transporters that may confer MDR phenotype to cancer cells. Like P-gp, multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), belonging to the ABCC subfamily, are ABC transporters normally expressed in the canalicular part of the hepatocyte where they play an important role in biliary transport [52]. Unlike P-gp, studies have shown that multiple members of MRP (MRP-1–MRP-8) are involved in cancer drug resistance (Table 2). Each member is responsible for the resistance to a number of anticancer compounds, including 5-fluorouracil, anthracyclines, vincristine, methotrexate, camptothecins, and etoposide. MRP also transport neutral or mildly anionic drug conjugates [53]. Many substrates of MRP are drug con- jugates of lipophilic anions (e.g., glucuronate or glutathione conjugates). BCRP (also known as ABCG2) is a half ABC transporter. It is sometimes known as mitoxantrone resistance protein (MXR) because of its elevated expression in many cancer cell lines selected with mitoxantrone [54]. BCRP was first identified in breast cancer, but it is also found in several normal tissues, including placenta, liver canaliculi, small intestine, colon, the bronchial epithe- lial layer in the lung, and endothelial cells [55]. Its level is also elevated in other cancer types. For instance, an analysis of 150 untreated tumors with immuno- histochemical technique demonstrated a high incidence of BCRP overexpres- sion particularly in tumors of gastrointestinal origin [56]. Elevated BCRP level is consistently associated with the phenotype that includes strong resistance to mitoxantrone, moderate resistance to anthracyclines, and sensitivity to 126 H.L. Wong et al. paclitaxel, cisplatin, and vinca alkaloids, and is also implicated in drug resis- tance to newer anticancer compounds such as SN-38, topotecan, and etoposide [54, 57, 58–61]. Other less known ABC transporters such as ABCA2 and ABCA3 are also implicated in MDR. These two membrane transporters are members of the ABC1 subfamily. A high level of ABCA2 transporter is associated with the resistance to mitoxantrone and estramustine in small-cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines [62, 63], respectively. In these studies, ABCA2 transporter was found localized in the endolysosomal compartment. It was therefore suggested that ABCA2 transporter contributed to the MDR phenomenon by lysosomal detox- ification instead of the most commonly seen drug efflux mechanism. In addition, increased levels of ABCA2 and ABCA3 transporters were also detected in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia using microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses [64, 65]. These cancer cells were shown more resistant to vinblastine, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. 3 Therapeutic Strategies Reversing Multidrug Resistance 3.1 MDR Reversal Agents Targeting ABC Transporters Since 1980s a number of ‘‘MDR reversal agents’’ (Table 3) have been identified or synthesized to target different steps of the transporter-mediated MDR mechanism. The ‘‘first-generation’’ MDR reversal agents including verapamil, quinidine, cyclosporin A, tamoxifen, and a number of calmodulin antagonists are drugs commonly used for other therapeutic indications but found to possess P-gp mod- ulatory activities [37]. In comparison, the MDR reversal agents of the newer generations were specifically designed for overcoming MDR. They are more potent and P-gp selective than the first-generation compounds. The second-generation agents including dex-verapamil, Valspodar (PSC833), and Biricodar (VX710) are novel analogs of the first-generation agents [67], whereas the third-generation agents including Tariquidar (XR9576) [68], Zosuquidar (LY335979) [69], Laniqui- dar (R101933) [70], ONT093 [71], and Elacridar (GF120918/GG918) [72] are synthetic molecules developed using structure–activity relationship and combina- torial chemistry. Some of these newer generation agents are effective in blocking the cellular drug efflux at micro- and even nano-molar ranges for extended time [68, 73]. In an in vitro study, the P-gp transporters remained blocked for more than 22 h after Tariquidar treatment had been withdrawn [74]. The in vivo activity of the second and third generation compounds has also been confirmed. Significantly increased tumor accumulation of P-gp substrates such as 99m-Tc-Sestamibi was detected in patients treated with dex-verapamil, PSC833, or XR9576 [75–77]. The clinical efficacy of MDR reversal agents is less proven. A number of clinical trials have led to unsatisfactory outcomes [37] with several causes of failure identified. Because the first-generation agents often require high doses to Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 127 achieve the desired chemosensitization effect, they all carry high risks of toxicity (see Table 3). These agents and their second-generation analogs are also sub- strates for other important metabolic enzymes (e.g., cytochrome-P450) and transporter systems (e.g., organic cationic transporter), so undesirable Table 3 MDR reversal agents for inhibition of ABC transporters Primary target MDR reversal agents Notes P-gp First generation Verapamil Clinical benefit seen in breast cancer and NSCLC patients, but as a calcium channel blocker to lower blood pressure, frequent hypotension, and other intolerable cardiovascular side effects observed Cyclosporin A As an immunomodulatory agent, may lead to nephrotoxicity.

Wong et al. pharmacokinetic interactions occasionally happened when they were combined with other anticancer agents [78]. For instance, increased serum concentrations of paclitaxel and vinblastine were observed when PSC833 was co-administered [79]. These interactions are usually too unpredictable to cope with by dose adjustment. The biggest challenge against the use of MDR reversal agents for cancer treatment relates to the clinical significance of MDR reversal. Some clinicians argued that P-gp overexpression is merely a prognostic indicator reflecting the aggressiveness of the cancer cells [80, 81]. Following this argu- ment, inhibition of P-gp can only relieve a symptom, but cannot cure the cancer disease itself. On the other hand, moderate but significant clinical benefits of MDR reversal agents were indeed observed in a few trials. For instance, the addition of cyclosporin A to the regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin in acute myelogenous leukemia patients significantly improved the relapse-free survival (34% vs. 9%) and overall survival rates (22% vs. 12%) [82], with the best outcomes obtained in the subgroup showing the highest P-gp levels. A similar study with PSC833, the potent analog of cyclosporine-A, also resulted in significant improvement in the P-gp-overexpressing subgroup [83]. In a phase II trial conducted to study VX710 in patients with locally advanced or meta- static breast cancer resistant to paclitaxel, an 11% response rate was observed, although this was accompanied by a 40% incidence of grade 4 neutropenia [84]. Up to date, the clinical results of the third-generation compounds are pend- ing. The data obtained so far have been inconclusive but showing signs of promise. At a minimum, most phase I trials indicate that they are safe and rarely lead to significant pharmacokinetic interactions [85]. Some adverse effects including mild cases of neutropenia and cardiac toxicity were detected in the trial of GG918, but they were generally moderate and reversible [86]. There are suggestions that treatment failures may be derived from the fact that these MDR reversal agents are unable to inhibit all of the ABC transporters responsible for the clinical drug resistance. This prompts some researchers to combine different MDR reversal agents at low doses, and improvement of efficacy was observed [87]. Finally, there were also researchers arguing that MDR reversal agents should be used together with other molecular targeting agents and in the context of cancer stem cell theory to be truly effective [22, 66]. It is obvious that further studies are required to determine how exactly MDR reversal agents should be used to achieve the optimal chemosensitizing effects in the clinical settings. 3.2 Reversal of MDR with Drug Carrier of Nano- or Micro-meter Size Studies have shown that drug delivery systems such as microspheres, nanopar- ticles, and liposomes are able to improve the therapeutic index of cancer Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 129 chemotherapy. These systems offer several advantages over the conventionally used free drug solution. (1) Drug carrier of submicron size can take advantage of the ‘‘enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)’’ effect [88] (also refer to Chapter 6 for details). These small carriers tend to extravasate into the tumor site and stay longer at this site, resulting in prolonged elevation of local tumor drug level. (2) The physicochemical parameters of a drug carrier, e.g., particle size, surface charge, and surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, can be conve- niently modified to achieve the optimal EPR effect and minimal binding to the body tissues and serum proteins. (3) A drug carrier can be further optimized by surface engineering for cancer targeting. For example, the carrier surface can be grafted with polyethylene glycol chains to achieve immunosurveillance evasion [89] or labeled with molecular targeting agents for enhanced specificity for the tumor cells expressing the corresponding surface targets [90]. For further infor- mation about the use of nanomedicine for cancer therapy refer to Chapter 21. Here we will focus on their use for overcoming MDR. In general, particulate drug carriers can be used to reverse MDR by three ways: (1) intrinsic MDR reversal activities of drug carriers; (2) encapsulation and delivery of MDR reversal agents; (3) delivery of combinational therapy or unconventional anticancer agents; and (4) bypassing the membrane transporter resistance mechanisms. Some researchers also combined more than one of these approaches to obtain additional MDR reversal activity. 3.2.1 Intrinsic MDR Reversal Activities of Drug Carriers It has long been recognized that nanoparticles are able to circumvent the effect of P-gp and deliver compounds across the P-gp-rich BBB without damaging its structural integrity [91, 92]. There are also reports of improved drug accumulation in the drug-resistant cancer cells in the absence of additional MDR reversal agents as long as the drugs are delivered by nanoparticle or liposomal systems [93, 94]. In addition, studies performed on both non-cancerous and cancerous tissues have demonstrated that some particulate formulations, even without any loaded drug, can inhibit the functions of membrane transporters [95, 96]. This suggests that some drug carriers possess their own intrinsic chemosensitizing properties. Many drug carriers are made of hydrophobic materials such as lipids and poly(butyl cyanoacrylate). It will be thermodynamically unstable for submi- cron particles made of these materials to remain dispersed in an aqueous environment such as blood circulation. Surfactants or block co-polymers are therefore routinely included in these formulations to prevent particle aggrega- tion. Studies showed that a number of these agents, most noticeably the non- ionic surfactants such as polysorbates (also known as Tweens) and Tritons and block co-polymers such as poloxamers (also known as Pluronics), may inhibit the ABC transporters [97–99]. As previously discussed, ABC transporters interact with their substrates in the lipid bilayers of the plasma membrane. Surfactants can disrupt the arrangement of the lipid bilayer expressing the transporters and subsequently inhibit their drug efflux activities [97, 100]. It 130 H.L. Wong et al. was shown that Triton-X-100-immobilized dextran microspheres can enhance vinblastine accumulation by Chinese hamster ovary cells by twofold [101]. Extensive studies have been conducted on the use of poloxamers for the delivery of anticancer drugs to MDR cells [99]. Poloxamers are non-ionic, amphiphilic polymers with surfactant properties. They can be used for nano- particle coating or directly as a chemosensitizer or form micelles for drug delivery [102, 103]. Studies conducted using the drug-resistant SKVLB ovarian cancer cell line showed that concurrent treatment with Pluronic P85 could lead to 80- to 1090-fold increases in the cellular accumulation of a range of che- motherapeutic compounds including daunorubicin, cisplatin, mitomycin-C, methotrexate, and vinblastine [104], and up to 2–3 orders of magnitude increase in the cytotoxicity. It was suggested that in addition to causing inhibition of the ABC transporters, poloxamer-based carriers also compromise a number of alternative drug resistance mechanisms, including prevention of drug seques- tration by acidic vesicles, inhibition of glutathione/glutathione S-transferase detoxification system, and reduction in the intracellular ATP levels in the MDR cells [105, 106]. The last mechanism is noteworthy as drug resistance is a multi- factorial phenomenon, and many of the mechanisms involved, e.g., ABC trans- porters, are ATP-dependent. By depleting their common energy source, the drug resistance problem could be more effectively controlled. 3.2.2 Encapsulation and Delivery of MDR Reversal Agents The use of MDR reversal agents is frequently limited by their side effects, risk of inducing drug interactions, and unfavorable physicochemical properties. It was reasoned that these limitations can be at least in part overcome by encapsulat- ing and delivering these agents with drug carriers. Using the previously men- tioned Triton-linked microsphere system as an example, significant reduction in the toxicity was achieved by immobilization of Triton-X-100 molecules on dextran particles [101]. In addition, some MDR reversal agents are poorly soluble in water, and are therefore more efficiently administered using lipid- based or hydrophobic polymer carrier systems. For example, cyclosporin A could be easily delivered using solid lipid nanoparticles [107]. The analog of cyclosporin A, PSC833, was delivered by liposomes made of intralipids for in vivo inhibition of P-gp at the BBB in primates [108]. In this study the AUCbrain/ AUCblood ratio of 11C-verapmail(as a P-gp substrate) radioactivity was increased 2.3-fold with the addition of PSC833-liposomes. Recently, the concept of simultaneous delivery of cytotoxic anticancer com- pounds and MDR reversal agents has been studied. Polymer–lipid hybrid nanoparticle (PLN) systems co-loaded with doxorubicin (cytotoxic compound) and verapamil (as MDR reversal agent) or GG918 were prepared [109]. It was found that the dual-loaded system resulted in the highest accumulation of doxorubicin in the drug-resistant MDA435/MDR1 breast cancer. The doxor- ubicin-mediated cell kill was also improved by nearly an order of magnitude when compared to the combination of free doxorubicin and GG918 solution. Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 131 These studies also showed that when the cytotoxic drug/MDR reversal agent combination was delivered in a single drug carrier instead of two separate carrier systems, the anticancer effect as measured by clonogenic assays was several times stronger. It was suggested that the use of cytotoxic drug/chemosensitizer co- loaded carrier system may provide enhanced MDR reversal effect due to elevated local levels of both agents near the membrane transporters (Fig. 2). Additional chemosensitization may also be achieved by particle endocytosis. 3.2.3 Delivery of Combinational Therapy or Unconventional Anticancer Agents Synergistic anticancer effects can sometimes be achieved by combining multiple chemotherapeutic compounds in the chemotherapy (i.e., polytherapy), espe- cially when these compounds use different cytotoxic mechanisms, e.g., doxor- ubicin and mitomycin-C [111]. Cancer cells are less likely to develop several different drug resistance mechanisms to counteract the therapy. The main drawback of this strategy is the increased risk of side effects [3]. This risk may be reduced by delivering the polytherapy with drug carrier. In recent studies, it was shown that PLN delivering both doxorubicin and mitomycin-C could reduce the colony-forming ability of the P-gp overexpressing MDA435/ MDR1 breast cancer cells to nearly 1%. This effect was particularly strong when the two agents were dual loaded and delivered using the same PLN. As shown in Fig. 3, significantly higher DNA double-strand breaks were obtained with the dual-loaded PLN. Instead of treating drug-resistant cancers with multiple chemotherapeutic compounds to achieve better cytotoxic effect, some researchers turn to novel therapeutic agents which remain effective against MDR cells. Many of these unconventional therapeutic agents such as oligonucleotides and small-interfering RNA (i.e., siRNA) are often fairly unstable in vivo [113, 114]. This problem can be overcome by encapsulating them in drug carriers.

Wong et al. studying the use of microspheres encapsulated with glucose oxidase (GOX) for MDR cancer treatment [115]. We found that cancer cells can be extensively killed by the reactive oxidative species generated by the encapsulated GOX enzyme. The most appealing feature of this therapy is that the GOX-mediated cytotoxic effect is essentially unaffected by the MDR phenotype (Fig. 4). Further studies will be conducted to optimize this strategy. 3.2.4 Bypassing Membrane Transporter Resistance Mechanism by Endocytosis Drug delivery to cancer cells commonly involves release of drug molecules from the drug carrier located at the proximity of the cells, and diffusion of these released free drug molecules across the cell membrane to reach the cytosol. However, when a drug carrier is of submicron size, it can alternatively take the endocytotic routes to deliver its full load of drugs to the cytoplasmic compart- ment [116]. In this manner, the drug molecules may bypass the interception by the membrane transporters and avoid efflux. Several mechanisms of endocytotic pathways exist. These include clathrin- mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and non-clathrin receptor-mediated endocytosis (Table 4). All of these pathways can be exploited for drug trafficking into resistant cancer cells. For example, the Fig. 3 Induction of DNA double-strand breaks by single and dual agent PLN formulations. (A) MDA435/LCC6/WT cells were treated with drug–PLN formulation containing 1.2 mM DOX and 0.6 mM MMC for 1 h prior to processing by the TUNEL assay for DNA double- strand break induction.

Wong et al. clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway has been targeted to enhance the penetra- tion of drug carrier into the BBB. In the studies by Kreuter et al., poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles coated with polysorbate-80 were formulated to treat brain diseases that are highly resistant to drug therapy [117]. The polysorbate-80 molecules on the carrier surface not only directly inhibited the P-gp at the BBB but also promoted apolipoproteins B and E adsorption on the nanoparticle surface [118]. These adsorbed apolipoproteins then in turn bound to the low-density- lipoprotein receptors on the endothelial cells forming the BBB and triggered clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the nanoparticles. As a result, these polysor- bate-coated nanoparticles were able to efficiently deliver doxorubicin across the BBB, resulting in a significantly elevated AUC of doxorubicin in the brain and stronger anticancer effect against the intracranial glioblastoma in rat models [118]. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis is involved in viral transfection. This route can therefore be used for the delivery of oncolytic genetic materials by a viral vector [120]. Macropinocytosis is a relatively non-specific process which allows uptake of large particles up to the micron size range [121]. It is likely useful for the delivery of systems like solid lipid nanoparticles and PLN, which are Table 4 (continued) Endocytotic pathways Features Examples of endocytotic transport Applications for drug trafficking \u0004 Direct transport to ER and Golgi bodies.

Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 135 frequently 200–300 nm in diameter. Macropinocytosis is also related to the uptake of TAT peptides [122]. One recent trend is the delivery of TAT-fusion products containing anticancer moieties to cancer cells. Significant anticancer activities were observed both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, macropinocytotic pathway leads to the formation of relatively leaky and non-acidic vesicles [123], and this feature has drawn scientists’ interest to develop new forms of gene therapy which can escape into the cytoplasm with relative ease. Receptor- mediated endocytosis such as folate receptor-mediated uptake has also been studied for drug-resistant cancer targeting. Several drug-resistant cancers express elevated levels of folate receptors [124]. By linking to folate molecules, increased cellular uptake of quantum dots and solid lipid nanoparticles carrying cancer imaging agents and anticancer compounds have been demonstrated [125, 126]. It is now recognized that there are several therapeutic advantages of targeting the endocytotic routes for drug-resistant cancer therapy besides evasion of mem- brane transporters. It was suggested that when an anticancer compound is deliv- ered by a particulate carrier, drug molecules can stay longer in the cytoplasmic compartmentasitisunlikelyfor themembrane transporters to eliminate the particulate components. Figure 5 illustrates this strategy. P-gp-overexpressing breast cancer cells were treated with doxorubicin in free solution or nanoparticles. Two hours following the end of the treatment a high level of doxorubicin, a P-gp substrate, was shown mostly retained in the cancer cells when the drug was administered by nanoparticles, whereas most doxorubicin administered as free Fig. 5 Fluorescence microscope images demonstrating the effect of drug carrier on the retention and intracellular distribution of doxorubicin (Dox) in MDA435/LCC6/MDR1 human breast cancer cells overexpressing P-gp. Cells were all incubated with Dox solution or nanoparticles containing Dox (Dox-PLN) for 2 h. Images were taken either within 5 min after the end of treatment or 2 h after the end of treatment and re-incubation in drug-free EBSS medium at 378C. Enhanced retention of drugs and particles were observed when delivered in PLN form. Magnification of objective ¼ 100\u0003. Bars represent 20 mm (adapted from Wong et al. [127]) 136 H.L. Wong et al. solution has been removed from the cytoplasm by P-gp [127]. By prolonging the retention time of the chemotherapeutic compounds in the cytoplasm, additional anticancer effects may be achieved. In another study, doxorubicin was conjugated with the copolymer of N-(2- hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (pHPMA). This conjugate was not equally efficaciousagainst both MDR and non-MDR cancers; long-term treatment of cancer cells with it also did not lead to the acquired MDR phenotype [128]. A recent study further indicated that pHPMA–doxorubicin could induce addi- tional caspase-dependent apoptosis signaling pathways to trigger a stronger apoptotic response in cancer when compared to the free drug [129]. Overall, with better understanding of the endocytotic mechanisms, it is expected that more reasonable and efficient designs of drug carrier will be developed for effective therapy of chemoresistant cancers. 4 New Perspectives on Overcoming Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumors With better understanding of cancer biology, the role of ABC transporters has been recently redefined. It is now becoming clear that the drug resistance conferred by these membrane transporters needs to be considered within the context of the function of cancer progenitor cells and other forms of drug resistance such as non- cellular resistance in solid malignancies. Along this trend, it is also important to re- examine the field of MDR reversal and improve its therapeutic value. 4.1 Cancer Progenitor/Stem Cells and Multidrug Resistance Cancer progenitor cells and their early progeny (e.g., cancer stem cells) are critical in generating a heterogeneous population of differentiated cancer cells to form a complete tumor [130–133]. Cancer stem cells are also capable of self- renewal when the size of their cell pool is reduced (refer to Chapter 16). From the therapeutic viewpoint, it is the response of the progenitor/stem cells, not their more differentiated descendants, to the treatment that determines whether a cancer is curable or not. If these groups of cells persist after treatment, they will eventually regenerate the differentiated cell subpopulations to reinitiate the malignant disease. Meanwhile, cancer progenitor/stem cells have been shown to be more susceptible to genetic mutations and can easily acquire the drug- resistant and aggressive phenotypes. This explains a number of phenomena including the acquired MDR phenotypes and the suboptimal clinical efficacy of many anticancer compounds that perform well in in vitro experiments. These cancer progenitor/stem cells are highly adaptive and can ‘‘get tough’’ during the course of chemotherapy. If they are not killed early, the risk of encountering drug resistance in the advanced stage will be far higher [66]. Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 137 New paradigms for the treatment of drug-resistant cancer therefore need to incorporate the concepts of cancer progenitor/stem cells. Instead of reversing drug resistance of cancer cells in general, the inhibitors of drug resistance mechanisms such as the ABC transporters should be designed to specifically target the cancer progenitor/stem cells. There are many possibilities: (1) It was shown that cancer stem cells express high levels of different ABC transporter members, as indicated by the high efflux rates of a broad range of ABC trans- porter substrates including Hoechst dye, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, gemcita- bine, and mitoxantrone [134]. Among these transporters, BCRP are especially abundant [135]. MDR reversal agents that inhibit multiple transporters including BCRP (e.g., GG-918 and tariquidar) are therefore potentially more effective than the inhibitors that are too specific for one transporter. (2) It is also possible to directly link these MDR reversal agents to a progenitor/stem cell targeting agent such as antibody against the stem cell surface markers to enhance the treatment specificity and reduce the systemic toxicity. (3) Along this line of thoughts, the MDR reversal agents can be encapsulated and delivered using nanosized drug carrier surface engineered for cancer progenitor/stem cell targeting [66]. 4.2 Other Molecular Pathways and Multidrug Resistance A growing body of evidence shows that ABC transporters likely work in an integrated and interactive manner with other drug resistance pathways. By targeting these molecular pathways, it is sometimes possible to indirectly mod- ulate the ABC transporters to achieve additional drug resistance reversal effects. For example, the activity of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) was found elevated in some resistant forms of cancer [136]. GCS is an enzyme converting the pro-apoptotic ceramide into glucosylceramide, and a higher activity of GCS will decrease the cellular ceramide level and hence prevent the apoptotic death of cancer cells. It was found that inhibition of GCS by novel agents such as siRNA and D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpho- lino-1-propanol also downregulated the overexpressed P-gp and enhanced the cellular uptake and activity of chemotherapeutic compounds [137, 138]. Another example is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway, which triggers the progression of several aggressive and resistant forms of cancer when activated. It was found that the use of gefitinib to modulate the dysfunctional EGFR signaling pathway may also inhibit the membrane transporter-mediated drug efflux. Sensitivity to several chemother- apeutic compounds such as mitoxantrone, topotecan, and SN-38 was restored in cancer cell lines selected to overexpress P-gp and/or BCRP [139, 140]. Cox-2 activity has also been recently linked to P-gp expression. Inhibition of Cox-2 with its inhibitor celecoxib was able to inhibit P-gp [141]. In the first of the above three examples, it was additionally shown that the inhibition of P-gp by PSC833 also stimulated the ceramide synthesis pathway, so the cancer cells 138 H.L. Wong et al. became more vulnerable to apoptosis-inducing agents. It is apparent that this effect can spread between different drug resistance pathways in a two-way manner. When an ABC transporter is being targeted, attention must also be paid to whether additional chemosensitization effect is achieved via other pathways. 4.3 Solid Tumors and Multidrug Resistance It was argued that this tumor microenvironment cannot be overlooked in the discussion of drug resistance and the related therapy. Solid tumors are not simple aggregates of tumor cells, but possess heterogeneous and structurally complex organ-like structures [142]. They are generally less sensitive to chemotherapy than malignancies consisting of circulating single cells, e.g., leukemia. This phenom- enon is likely related to the unique microenvironment of solid tumors, including the formation of inaccessible spots in the tumor as a result of its poorly organized vasculature, impediment of drug diffusion by the high cell density in solid tumors, prevention of efficient convective flow from the blood vessel to the tumor by the elevated interstitial fluid pressure inside the tumor, deactivation of anticancer compounds by the acidic environment in the tumor core, the presence of extra- cellular matrix that may prevent drug penetration and increase the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis, and the development of various resistance mechanisms in the hypoxic cancer cells located inside the tumor (e.g., entering quiescent state) [142]. In brief, the microenvironment in a solid tumor can both reduce the amount of drugs getting inside (pharmacokinetic barrier) and render the drugs that reach the target less active (pharmacodynamic barrier). In the context of drug resistance and cancer stem cell theory, it is not hard to see that the task of killing cancer progenitor/stem cells can only get more difficult when these cells are packed densely together with their differentiated descendants in the solid tumor microenvironment. A significant portion of a solid tumor will inevitably receive drug therapy at sub-therapeutic concentrations. This is com- pounded by the fact that cancer progenitor/stem cells are intrinsically more drug resistant. Although recent studies showed that these cells might prefer to locate near the blood vessels [143], it was also found that some of the cells distal to blood vessels can repopulate tumors after chemotherapy, revealing the presence of some cancer stem cells situated deep inside the tumor mass [144]. A number of drug resistance reversal strategies are therefore developed to improve drug penetra- tion, so these cells can become accessible to the therapy. Some of these strategies are listed in Table 5. Some exciting findings have been obtained. For example, a single dose of lipid nanoparticles for sustained release of doxorubicin injected intratumorally into a highly invasive EMT6 breast cancer was able to cause extensive cell death within the tumor core, and the subsequent growth of tumor was delayed by nearly 100% [145]. Nonetheless, in general, the use of these strategies is still largely in experimental stage. Whether these promising findings will translate into clinical use remains to be seen. Multidrug Resistance in Solid Tumor and Its Reversal 139 5 Conclusion and Future Directions Although the discovery of ABC transporters and their inhibitors represents an exciting approach to drug resistance reversal in cancer, this task is far from completion. It must be emphasized that clinical drug resistance is the result of multiple inter-related mechanisms interplayinginanintegratedmanner. However, with proper adjustment of the current paradigm for MDR reversal, this form of treatment will still prove to be extremely valuable. Further studies should provide us a better understanding of the interaction between the ABC transporter- mediated resistance mechanism and other drug resistance pathways. The MDR reversal therapy can be properly integrated with the agents targeting these path- ways to achieve synergistic effects. More detailed characterization of cancer stem/ progenitor cells and better understanding of the role of membrane transporter mechanisms in these cells is also needed. MDR reversal therapy should be designed to target these cancer cell subpopulations. To reach this goal the current MDR reversal therapy should be more effective. In addition to further improvement of the MDR reversal agents, the advances made in the development of novel experi- mental therapeutics such as nanomedicines and various solid tumor permeabiliza- tion techniques should also be considered. Further works will lead to the develop- ment of a more holistic and effective formofdrugresistancereversal therapy. References 1.

Rishi, Xinbo Zhang, and Anil Wali 1 Introduction Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is essential for the regulation of development, the generation of the immune system, and is a central mechan- ism for maintenance of cellular homeostasis in eukaryotes. This phenomenon of cellular death was described for almost a century, and was named apoptosis only recently to differentiate naturally occurring cell death during development from the acute injury associated necrotic cell death [1]. The apoptosis processes function to maintain equilibrium between cell proliferation and death, while dysregulated apoptosis is involved in development and etiology of many patho- logical disorders. The acute pathological conditions such as stroke, heart attack, or liver failure as well as chronic neurodegenerative disorders are associated with increased apoptosis resulting in sudden or progressive death of the target tissues. The pathologies of auto-immune disorders and carcino- genesis, on the other hand, arise due in part to the loss or reduced rate of apoptosis. Approximately half of the known clinical pathologies are estimated to arise due to either too little or too much apoptosis. Apoptosis is considered a major mechanism of chemotherapy-induced cell death, and many currently utilized cytotoxic anti-cancer agents are known to function by promoting apoptosis in the target cells. Although the precise mechanisms of actions of many anti-cancer agents are yet to be elucidated, the apoptosis by most agents is often initiated by either damage to the cellular DNA or key signaling mediators that regulate cell survival [2]. The defects in apoptosis signaling pathways in the cancer cells therefore contribute to reduction or abrogation of the initial stress response signals and apoptosis, resulting in development of drug-resistant phenotypes. Since, adequate therapies for many disorders are lacking, the apoptosis signaling pathways therefore can be exploited in the preclinical A.K.

Apoptosis signaling is transduced by two distinct molecular pathways that consist of the intrinsic, or mitochondria-mediated pathway, and the extrinsic,or extracellular receptor-activated pathway [3–5]. The morphologic characteristics of the cells undergoing apoptosis include cell membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and nucleosomal fragmentation. The neighboring healthy cells of the tissue or the macrophages eventually devour the fractionated remains of the apoptotic cells. The intracellular stress signals including DNA damage and high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as viral infection and activation of oncogenes induce intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The extrinsic pathway on the other hand is activated by the binding of an extracellular ligand to a receptor on the plasma membrane. The eventual breakdown of the cellular proteins, organelles, and cell architecture is accomplished by proteolytic enzymes called caspases that are activated by both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (Fig. 1). The caspases are Fig. 1 Schematic of apoptosis signaling pathways. Lines with arrowheads indicate activation and lines with diamondheads indicate inhibition of a target gene. Cyto C, cytochrome c; ROS, reactive oxygen species; GF, growth factors 150 A.K. Rishi et al. normally expressed as inactive precursors and the apoptosis signals target them for post-translational modifications and cleavage to form active oligomers [6, 7]. Two broad groups of caspases consist of the initiator/apical caspases (caspase-8, caspase- 9, and caspase-10) and the effector/executioner caspases (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7). The autocatalytic mechanisms often activate the initiator caspases, while the effector caspases are generally dependent on the initiator caspases for their cleavage and activation. 2 Apoptosis Pathways 2.1 The Extrinsic Pathway The activation of extrinsic apoptosis is normally accomplished by binding of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands to their cognate cell surface TNFR and/or death receptors. The TNF family consists of 18 ligands that are thought to target 29 cell surface receptors [8]. The receptors that have been well characterized for their roles in apoptosis signaling include TNFR1 (aka DR1, CD120a, p55, and p60), Fas (aka CD95, DR2, Apo-1), DR3 (aka APO-3, LARD, TRAMP, and WSL1), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 1 (aka DR4, APO-2), TRAILR2 (aka DR5, KILLER and TRICK2), DR6, ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR), and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). These receptors harbor a distinct cytoplasmic domain termed death domain (DD). A subclass of receptors known as decoy receptors (DcRs) that do not have DD include TRAILR3 (aka DcR1), TRAILR4 (aka DcR2), DcR3, and osteoprotegrin (OPG). The DcRs also bind to various ligands but do not form intracellular signaling complexes [9]. Binding of the TNF to TNFRs generally activates cell survival and pro-inflammatory signal- ing. Many ligands of this family are also known to induce apoptosis signaling. In this context, the stimulation of apoptosis signaling by the ligands such as TRAIL/Apo2L and the FasL/CD95L is well documented [10, 11]. The extrinsic apoptosis signaling is central to maintaining immune homeostasis, development of autoimmunity, and orderly regulation of lymphogenesis [12]. This pathway is extensively utilized to derive cells from the progenitor cells (CD8 + T cells, natural killer cells [NK], dendritic cells) during processes of hematopoiesis. Further, induction of FasL, TNF, and TRAIL following antigen stimulation of T cells is critical in promoting contact-dependent destruction of T-cell target cells [13–17]. The caspase-like proteases known as granzymes that are often released by cytotoxic immune cells enter the target cells and activate apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms [18]. The signaling induced following ligation of TRAIL and FasL to the cell surface receptors is similar and leads to apoptosis; the TNF-dependent signal- ing, however, is more complex and often results in either cell survival or apoptosis outcomes [19]. The apoptosis signaling by these ligands promotes Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 151 recruitment of initiating caspases and various adaptor proteins at the cytoplas- mic death domains of the receptors. For example, the binding of FasL or TRAIL to the death receptors (DR4 and DR5) results in recruitment of the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) followed by the initiator caspase-8 and caspase-10 [20]. This assembly of proteins (death receptors, FADD, and caspases) is known as the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The assembly of DISC induces autoproteolytic cleavage of the caspase-8/10 [21–23]. This autoproteolytic cleavage of caspase- 8/10 is often blocked by binding of a FADD-like interleukin-1b-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (FLIP) with caspase-8/10. Thus, FLIP functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of autocatalytic activation of these caspases. The activated caspase-8/10 either directly target the effector caspases-3/6/7 [24] or activate the BH3-only protein Bid to target mitochondria. The activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid, and the truncated Bid (tBid) then targets mitochondria [25, 26], thereby connecting the extrinsic pathway to mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway (see below). The activated caspase-6 is also known to feedback-activate extrinsic pathway by cleaving caspase-8 [27]. 2.2 The Intrinsic Pathway The mitochondria are the key intracellular targets of the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. Bcl-2 family of proteins (discussed in detail below) function to transduce the intrinsic apoptosis signals by regulating mitochondrial outer membrane potential (MOMP) and release of the apoptogenic factors from mitochondria. Bcl-2 proteins contain from one to four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains which mediate protein interactions [28]. The proteins with four BH domains are usually associated with cell survival and have anti-apoptotic properties. The pro-apoptotic members of this family either have BH1-3 domains or have only the BH3 domain. The pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family function by binding to and antagonizing pro-apoptotic members, while the BH3-only members promote apoptosis by binding and antagonizing the pro-survival proteins [29]. On the basis of the death-promoting and antag- onistic interactions of various Bcl-2 family of proteins, a rheostat model was proposed in which the ratio of the pro- and the anti-apoptotic proteins was suggested to control the cell fate [30]. The tumor suppressor p53 or post- translational mechanisms such as phosphorylation also control the activity of several members of this family of proteins. For example, the cell survival and/or growth factor signals phosphorylate the BH-only protein Bad to promote its sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in prevention of its mitochondrial targeting [31]. On the other hand, cellular stresses, such as ionizing radiation (IR) or chemotherapy, activate a DNA damage response that enhances p53 stability. The increased p53, in turn, transcriptionally activates cyclin- dependent kinase (CDKI) p21 to promote cell cycle arrest to allow cells time 152 A.K. Rishi et al. to repair the damage. In an event the damage cannot be repaired, the elevated p53 mediates apoptotic cell death by either activating transcription of a number of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members or by binding with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members to facilitate activation of MOMP [32–34]. The intrinsic apoptosis signals promote oligomerization of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in the mitochondrial outer membrane to activate MOMP. For example, the pro-apoptotic, BH1-3 domain Bax and Bak proteins normally exist as inactive monomers. Bax resides in the cytosol or loosely attached to intracellular membranes [35], and Bak is bound by Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, or voltage-dependent anion channel protein 2 (VDAC-2) in the mitochondrial outer membrane [36–38]. The oligomerization of Bax and Bak causes release of the mitochondrial apoptogenic factors. These factors include cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) binding protein with low pI (Smac/DIA-BLO), and Omi stress-regulated endoprotease/high-temperature requirement protein A2 (Omi/HtrA2). These mitochondrial factors then bind with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), which recruits pro-caspase-9, promoting its self-activation. Activated caspase-9 then targets the downstream effectors caspase-3, caspase-7, to promote their cleavage and activation to transduce apoptosis signaling. Several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins (discussed in detail in a separate section later) antagonize activation of the effector caspases by inhibiting the active sites of caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9. A dynamic interplay of protein–protein interactions of the mitochondrial factors and the IAPs in turn regulate activation of effector caspases and apoptosis. When released from mitochondria, Smac/ DIA-BLO and Omi/HtrA2 can bind these IAPs and prevent their inhibition of the activated caspases [38–40]. 3 Targeting of the Extrinsic Pathway The extrinsic pathway often serves as an attractive target for intervention in chemo-resistant cancers that have defects in their mitochondrial/intrinsic apop- tosis signaling. Most of the strategies are directed to inducing apoptosis signals by activating TNF family of receptors. Although some TNF family receptors function in transducing cell survival and inflammation-associated signaling and blocking these receptors has been useful in lymphoid malignancies, the interac- tions of a number of TNF family of ligands with their receptors are known to stimulate apoptosis. Here, the cancer therapeutics applications causing activa- tion of extrinsic pathway have predominantly focused on TNFR1, Fas, and the death receptors 4 and 5. Two broad strategies have thus far been pursued to activate extrinsic apoptosis and include expression of recombinant ligands with only extracellular domains of type 2 receptors, and agonistic small molecules as well as monoclonal antibodies. Additional strategies have focused on targeting various intracellular effectors/mediators of this pathway. Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 153 Apoptosis signaling following ligation of TNF or FasL is a well-docu- mented mechanism of attenuating cancer cell growth in vitro; the utility of these ligands as systemic anti-cancer therapies, however, has been limited due mainly to their toxic side effects that include septic shock and lethal liver injuries [41–43]. Although not widely used in clinics, TNF in combina- tion with certain chemotherapeutic agents such as melphalan have been useful for localized treatments of sarcomas and melanomas where it is thought to promote destruction of tumor vasculature [44, 45]. In contrast to TNF or Fasl, TRAIL was not found to be cytotoxic for a variety of normal human cells including fibroblasts, epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle cells as well as astrocytes [46–48], while some toxic effects were notedinhepatocytes and brain tissues[49,50].Interestingly,systemic administration of recombinant human TRAIL in rodents and primates was found to be safe with minimal toxicities [46]. However, recombinant soluble TRAIL stimulated apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells in vitro as well as attenuated growth of different human cancer cell-derived tumor xenografts in vivo [10]. Monoclonal antibodies that targeted TRAILR1 (DR4) or TRAILR2 (DR5) elicited potent antitumor activities against variety of cancer cells in vitro and in preclinical cancer models [51, 52]. TRAILR2 antibody (TRA-8) hasbeenproventobecytotoxic to thehepatocellular carcinoma cells while sparing the normal hepatocytes. The reduced sensitivity of this antibody to the normal cells was attributed to generally low to absent levels of the DR4 in the normal cells. Another TRAILR1/DR4 antibody (HGS-ETR1) has been utilized in the phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of colon cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and non-Hodgkins lymphomas. A number of studies further demonstrated utility of TRAIL in combination with chemotherapy (IFN-g, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, genotoxic agents such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide) or radiotherapy [53–57]. The TRAIL in combination with che- motherapy or radiotherapy was found to attenuate tumor growth as well as progression in part by simultaneously inducing intrinsic as well as extrinsic apoptosis pathways. The underlying mechanisms vary from the tumor cell type, the TRAIL sensitization to chemotherapies nevertheless includes elevated expression/transcription of DR4 and DR5 receptors, enhanced assembly of the cell surface death receptors, downregulation of intracellular anti-apoptosis effectors such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or FLIP, and/or upregulation/ activation of pro-apoptosis effectors such as caspases or FADD [58–65]. In this context, agents that diminish/reduce FLIP expression have been found to sensitize tumor cells for TRAIL treatment. Reduced expression of FLIP by actinomycin D caused enhanced sensitivity of various tumor cells to recep- tor-induced apoptosis. In addition, other molecules such as PPARa ligands and proteasome inhibitors have been found to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in part by selectively inhibiting FLIP expres- sion [66–68]. 154 A.K. Rishi et al. 4 Caspases and Strategies for Targeting Their Activation Genetic and cell lineage studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans revealed involvement of both positive and negative regulators of apoptosis in the nema- tode’s developmental program [69]. Four genes, egl-1, ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9, encode proteins required for the general apoptosis program. The initiation of apoptosis is regulated by transcriptional upregulation of egl-1 [70]. Binding of egl-1 to anti-apoptotic ced-9 relieves the inhibition that ced-9 exerts on the adaptor ced-4, allowing ced-4 to bind and activate the cysteine (Cys) protease ced-3, which in turn cleaves multiple-specific cellular substrates to execute cell death. Multiple mammalian homologs of each class of the C. elegans ced proteins, known as caspases, regulate a complex apoptosis program. The caspase family includes 13 members that are classified into three groups [71]: initiators (caspase-2, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-10, and caspase-12), which initiate the caspase cascade in apoptosis; executioners (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7), which act in the downstream execution steps of the process; and inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, caspase-5 and caspase-11), which mediate cell death and inflammatory responses. Caspases are a family of Cys proteases that cleave their substrates after Asp residues. Caspases contain three main domains: a prodomain and large (p20) and small (p10) catalytic subunits. The large domain contains the active site Cys residue. Activation of caspases involves the proteolytic cleavage of zymogens, the removal of the prodomain and separation of the p20 and p10 subunits, or allosteric conformational changes. The prodomains of activator and inflammatory caspases contain protein–protein interaction domains (such as the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and the death-effector domain (DED)) that link them to apoptosis signaling molecules [7]. The termination of the caspase activity, on the other hand, generally involves their removal from the cell by the ubiquitin-targeted proteasome degradation machinery or direct inhibition of their enzymatic activities. Intriguingly, there is evidence that members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family are capable of both functions [72–74]. In light of the fact that caspase family of proteases plays important roles in both the signaling and execution phases of apoptosis, it is conceivable that low expression or dysregulation of caspase function might influence the apoptosis process and result in inappropriate cell proliferation [75]. Expression of execu- tion caspases in tumor cells has been investigated in detail, but the results are conflicting. For example, spontaneous regression and differentiation of neuro- blastoma are associated with the translocation of both ICE and CPP32 from the cytoplasm into the nuclei [76]. In contrast, the expression of ICE and CPP32 was significantly downregulated in the tissues of human hepatocellular carci- nomas compared to non-tumor parts, indicating that reduced expression of CPP32 may contribute to resistance against apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinomas [77]. In addition, the nuclear expression of caspase-3 was significantly higher in noninvasive than in invasive tumors of intraductal Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 155 papillary-mucinous tumor of the pancreas (IPMT) [78]. Since IPMT is a unique tumor that grows intraductally with rare stromal invasion, high expression of caspase-3 may reflect the benign biological behavior of IPMT. Two reports describe that high level of caspase-3, measured by immu- nohistochemistry and/or western blot analysis, might be an indicator of a good prognosis for non-small cell lung carcinomas [79, 80]. However, in vitro detection of enzymatic caspase-3 activity in colorectal carcinomas revealed that high activity of caspase-3 correlated with poor prognosis [81]. The caspase-3 expression index in human gastric carcinoma correlated signifi- cantly with lymph node metastasis and the lower caspase-3 expression index group had a better prognosis than the higher group [82]. A deficiency of caspase-8 has recently been described in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and in neuroblastomas [83, 84]. The reported observations of caspase-8 changes in cancer cells, including gene deletion, methylation, and point mutation, iden- tify mechanisms by which some tumors, including lung carcinoma, Ewing tumors, neuroblastoma and melanomas, may escape caspase-8-mediated cell death. The gene of caspase-8 is silenced through DNA methylation as well as through gene deletion. Treatment with the demethylation agent 5-aza-2’- deoxycytidine (5-dAzaC) reversed hypermethylation of caspase-8, resulting in restoration of caspase-8 expression andrecruitment andactivationof caspase-8 at the CD95 DISC upon receptor cross-linking thereby sensitizing for death receptor, and importantly, also for drug-induced apoptosis [85]. In addition to the DNA methylation, three mutation sites in caspase-8 have recently been reported. A mutation modifies the stop codon and adds an Alu repeat to the coding region, thereby lengthening the protein by 88 amino acids in head and neck cancer cell lines [86]. Another missense mutation (alanine to valine) at the caspase-8 codon 96 was found in a neuroblastoma cell line lacking caspase-8 expression [87]. Deletion of the leucine 62 in caspase-8, which was observed in human vulval squamous carcinoma cells, dramatically altered the pro-apoptosis function of caspase-8 [88]. This muta- tion prevents interaction of pro-caspase-8 with FADD and, hence, the acti- vation of the caspase cascade. Strategies to target caspase activation or inhibition have been subjects of intense scientific investigation for drug development. A spectrum of caspase inhibitors have been identified and developed for potential applications in diseases and pathologic conditions such as alcoholic liver disease, ischemic kidney and brain injury, myocardial injury, and inflammatory diseases where prevention of tissue/cellular loss is desired [89]. Selective activation of caspases, on the other hand, is considered a valuable strategy for development of anti- cancer therapies (Table 1). A number of gene delivery approaches have been described. These include activation of inducible caspases by adenoviral gene transfer [90, 91] or their tissue/tumor-specific activation [92–94]. Additionally, tumor-selective activation of caspase-3 or caspase-6 by delivering their anti- Her2/erbB2 antibody fusions in a variety of Her-2-positive tumors in vitro and in xenograft mouse models have also been reported [95, 96].

The effective tumor targeting could potentially involve this reagent in combination with the anti- bodies against tumor-specific antigens. Unfortunately, the success of the gene delivery approaches has thus far been limited, thus provoking interest in devel- opment of cell-permeable, small molecule pharmacological activators of cas- pases for potential anti-cancer utility. In this context, Buckley et al. [98] reported identification of soluble RGD peptides that promote apoptosis by direct intracellular activation of caspase-3. The naturally occurring RGD tri- peptide sequence near the active site of caspase-3 is thought to regulate the quiescent state of this caspase, and the presence of the RGD peptide disrupts the intramolecular interaction and leads to the activation of the protease. These peptides are currently in clinical use as anti-thrombic agents, and are being further explored as candidate drugs to inhibit formation of new tumor blood vessels. High-throughput screening (HTS) approaches are also currently being pursued to identify inducers of caspase activity in living cells or in vitro models. A small molecule activator of caspase-3 was identified by HTS of chemical libraries [99]. This molecule, a-(trichloro-methyl)-4-pyridineethanol (PETCM), although activated caspase-3 in cell extracts, has a requirement of high con- centrations (200 mM) for in vitro activation of caspase-3 that unfortunately precludes its therapeutic utility. A similar HTS approach by Nguyen and Wells [100] reported identification of dichlorobenzyl carbamates and indolones as strong caspase activators. An indolone compound potently activated caspase-3 and cell death with an IC50 of 4–50 mM in various tumor cell lines in vitro. Further, Zhang et al. [101] reported caspase-activating gambogic acid deriva- tives that were shown to promote apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells and also in a syngeneic prostate animal cancer model that are currently being evaluated for their anti-cancer potential. 5 Inhibitors of Apoptosis as Potential Targets for Therapeutic Intervention Viruses are unable to grow or reproduce outside a host cell, but infection of viruses causes disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in cell death. Thus, viruses have to keep the host cell alive long enough for viral replication to occur. What is the mechanism by which viruses prevent premature cell death during infection? Normally, replication of baculovirus in host insect cell results in the formation of polyhedra at around 24-h post-infection. However, infection of p35 mutant virus causes cell death beginning at around 9–12 h post-infection, and no polyhedra are formed [102]. This discovery opened a new avenue to identify a family of proteins called inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). 158 A.K. Rishi et al. The IAP family has at least eight members, including XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP- 2, Ts-IAP, NAIP, survivin, Livin/ML-IAP, and Apollon/Bruce [73, 103–105]. In contrast to Bcl-2 family proteins, all IAPs constitute a family of anti- apoptotic proteins that possess between one and three zinc-binding baculo- viral IAP repeat (BIR) domains that are required for the suppression of apoptosis. Some family members also have a RING finger domain for the ubiquitination and degradation of caspases or caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD) at the C-terminus [74, 103, 106]. The IAP proteins have been divided into three classes based on the presence or absence of a RING finger and the homology of their BIR domains [107]. Class 1 IAPs (e.g., XIAP, cIAP- 1, cIAP-2, Livin/ML-IAP) contain homologous BIR domains and a RING finger motif. The Class 2 IAP family member NAIP has three BIR domains but no RING finger motif [108]. Class 3 IAP members, such as survivin, contain only a single BIR domain and no RING finger [109]. BIRs are regions of \u000270 amino acids that contain the signature sequence CX2CX16HX6C (C, cysteine; H, histidine; and X, any amino acid) and fold as three-stranded b sheets surrounded by four a helices [110–112]. BIRs function mainly by regulating protein–protein interaction. In XIAP, BIR3 (the third BIR domain) potently inhibits the activity of the active caspase-9, whereas the linker region between BIR1 and BIR2, as well as the BIR2 domain itself, selectively targets active caspase-3 or caspase-7 [133, 114]. Thus, IAP sup- presses apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting upstream (e.g., caspase-9) and downstream caspases (e.g., caspase-3 and caspase-7) through BIR domains [73, 103, 115]. IAPs inhibit both the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways for initiation of caspase activation, as well as influence a third minor pathway in which granzyme B directly activates caspase-3 [18, 116]. In apoptotic cells, caspase inhibition by IAP is negatively regulated by a mitochondrial protein, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac). Smac physically interacts with multiple IAPs through a conserved N-terminal IAP-binding motif (IBM) and relieves their inhibitory effect on caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9. Smac binds to the BIR3 domain of XIAP through four N-terminal residues (AVPI) that recognize a surface groove on BIR3. These four amino acids are conserved in three Drosophila proteins (Reaper, Grim, and Hid) that induce apoptosis by eliminating the binding of Drosophila IAP to caspases [117, 118]. Studies by Eckelman et al. [119] revealed that XIAP BIR2 and a short preceding peptide strand bind the substrate-binding cleft of caspase-3 and caspase-7, with the peptide strand in reverse orientation to that of sub- strate (‘‘back and front’’). In contrast, BIR3 inhibits caspase-9 by a novel allosteric mechanism in which its distal helix forces caspase-9 into an inactive monomeric conformation by interposition between the caspase dimerization interfaces [120]. Unlike BIR2 and BIR3, the BIR1 domain of XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 functions in several signaling pathways via oligomerization of binding partner instead of binding caspase or IBM proteins such as Smac. For example, when overexpressed, XIAP BIR1 interacts with TGF-b activating Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 159 Kinase 1 associating subunit 1 to induce NF-kB activation [121]. These find- ings provide an example of functional diversity within BIRs. Many studies have revealed that IAPs are preferentially expressed in malig- nant cells and are prognostically important. For example, survivin a 16.5 kDa protein is overexpressed in almost all malignancies but rarely detected in normal differentiated adult tissues [109, 122], and its expression correlates with poor prognosis leading to the hypothesis that IAP overexpression might be an oncogenic event [122, 123]. XIAP is also overexpressed in many cancer cell lines and cancer tissues. High XIAP expression has been correlated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and to poor clinical outcomes [124]. However, knocking out XIAP with siRNA or antisense oligonucleo- tides restores chemosensitivity in a variety of cancer cells [125–128]. Given possible importance of IAPs in tumorigenesis, strategies summarized in Table 2 have been developed to target IAPs by downregulating their expression with different techniques including gene knockdown (antisense oligonucleotides and RNA interference), gene therapy, small molecule antagonist, and immu- notherapy (DNA vaccine). Mesri et al. [129] reported generation of adeno- viruses expressing nonphosphorylatable mutant of survivin that induced apoptosis in cancer cells by interfering with survivin function and suppressed breast cancer xenograft growth in animal models. The antisense molecules targeting depletion of IAPs used in research studies and clinical trial include DNA oligonucleotides or RNA oligonucleotides or mixture of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides. The antisense molecule inhibits its target by forming a duplex with the native mRNA. In this double-stranded conformation, intracellular RNAase H cleaves the native mRNA while leaving the antisense intact. The antisense is released back into the cytoplasm where it is capable of binding additional target mRNA. Thus, antisense oligonucleotides knock down their targets by promoting the degradation of native mRNA rather than by directly inhibiting translation. In preclinical studies, antisense oligo- nucleotides against either XIAP [128, 130, 131] or survivin [132] directly induced apoptosis and sensitized malignant cells to chemotherapy and g- irradiation. Antisense oligonucleotide compounds against XIAP (AEG35156) and survivin (YM-155 and LY-2181308) are already in Phase I/II trials for treatment of a variety of cancers (http://clinicaltrials.gov). The discovery that synthetic 21–23 nucleotide RNA duplexes can trigger an RNA interference (RNAi) response in mammalian cells and induce strong inhibi- tion of specific gene expression has opened the door to the therapeutic use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [133]. Several studies using chemically synthesized siRNAs or plasmid/viral vectors encoding short hairpin RNAs showed that RNAi-mediated survivin knockdown was able to reduce tumor cell proliferative potential and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in a vari- ety of human tumor cell models, as well as to decrease the formation of new tumors and the growth of already established lesions in nude mice [134]. An alternate approach to inhibiting IAPs involves small molecules that block active sites on the IAP protein. Structural and functional studies have 160 A.K.

Different groups of small molecules have been identified using methods such as high-throughput fluorescent polarization competitive binding assay [135, 136], computer-based rational drug design [137], high-throughput enzymatic de-repression assay [138], and computational structure-based herbal library screening [139]. Schimmer et al. [140] utilized an enzyme de-repression assay to screen for polyphenylurea-based XIAP antagonists. These polyphenylurea derivatives induced apoptosis in leukemia cells as well as suppressed growth of xenografted colon cancer cells in animal models. These molecules bind the active sites of IAPs and inhibit the interaction between IAPs and caspases and thereby repress IAP-mediated inhibition of caspases. Results indicate that all these small molecule compounds specifically bind to their targets and induce apoptosis and sensitize cells to anti-cancer treatment. Based on the crystal- lization of XIAP BIR3 in a complex with Smac, small compounds or peptide that mimic Smac function have also been reported [141]. These Smac peptides not only neutralize IAP inhibition of caspase activity in vitro but they also sensitize primary cancer cells to death receptor or chemotherapy-induced apop- tosis [142, 143]. Two main gene therapy approaches targeting survivin have been successfully developed. One is based on the use of plasmids or viral vectors to deliver dominant-negative survivin mutants to tumor cells [144, 145]. The second gene therapy approach involves the use of the survivin gene promoter to drive the expression of cytotoxic genes in tumor cells [146, 147]. Survivin is a tumor- associated antigen [148]. Autoantibody against survivin has been detected in cancer patients [149]. Survivin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induced by HLA-A2-binding peptide and dendritic cells from healthy donors efficiently lysed target cells, indicating that survivin epitopes are presented on a broad variety of malignancies and can be applied in vaccination therapies [150, 151]. These approaches are now in clinical testing [152]. 6 The Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 Family of Proteins as Targets for Anti-cancer Strategies In the multi-cellular organisms cells are normally protected from early death in part by the Bcl-2 family of anti- and pro-apoptotic regulators that mediate intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. BCL-2 (for B-cell lymphoma-2) was first iden- tified at the chromosomal breakpoint of t(14;18) bearing human follicular B-cell lymphoma [153–155]. Bcl-2-transfected B cells were shown to be resistant toward a default death process normally induced in B cells by IL-3 withdrawal [156]. Further experiments have demonstrated that overexpression of the human bcl-2 gene in the nematode C. elegans reduced the number of 162 A.K. Rishi et al. programmed cell deaths [157], and that ced-9 and bcl-2 are homologs, indicat- ing the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis are highly conserved within the animal kingdom [158]. These pioneer research work revealed that cell growth and survival were under independent genetic control and that Bcl-2-mediated pathway toward tumorigenesis depends not only on the ability to escape growth control but also depends on the ability to prevent apoptosis. At least 15 Bcl-2 family members have been identified in mammalian cells and several others in viruses [5]. As indicated before, all members possess at least one of four conserved motifs known as Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1–BH4). Based on the content of BH, the family numbers are classified into three groups [3]. Anti-apoptotic members (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-w, MCL-1, and A1) contain all four BH domains defined by their similarity among the members of the family and promote cell survival by inhibiting the function of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. In addition, all anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family have an N-terminal BH4 domain [159, 160]. The ‘‘multidomain’’ pro-apoptotic proteins (BAX, BAK, and Bok) contain BH domains 1–3. BH3-only proteins of pro-apoptotic members (e.g., BID, BAD, BIM, BIK, PUMA, and NOXA) contain only BH domain 3 (BH3) and are structurally diverse [161]. The 3D structure of Bcl-XL [162, 163] has revealed that several Bcl-2 family members share striking structural similarity to the pore-forming domains of bacterial toxins thus sparking a series of subsequent studies that demonstrated an ability of Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and Bax to form ion channels in synthetic membranes [164–166]. Although it is still unclear if these channels are functionally involved in apoptosis, pore formation by Bcl-2 pro- teins has been hypothesized to be important for regulating the release of cytochrome c and perturbing mitochondrial physiology [167]. Point mutations and domain deletion experiments indicate that the BH4 domain is essential for pro-survival protein such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w and that this domain functions by binding, sequestering, and inactivating apoptotic peptidase- activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) [160]. The BH3 domain in all pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2proteinsiscriticalfor theirinteraction with death suppressors. The BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains are single amphipathic alpha helices and form a hydrophobic pocket. This pocket is thought to act as a binding site for BH3- only death-promoting proteins [168]. An exact mechanism by which Bcl-2 regulates intrinsic pathway is still unclear, but there are at least three different models to explain how different stimuli trigger apoptosis [169]. In the first model, the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak are in an inactive conformation through direct interactions with one or two different anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. In response to an apoptosis stimulus, BH3-only proteins bind to and neutralize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, thereby releasing Bax and Bak [37, 170]. Alternatively, it has been shown that certain BH3-only proteins can interact with the pro-apoptotic proteins and trigger apoptosis by binding directly to Bax and Bak [171]. Finally, recent data suggest that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members sequester BH3-only proteins, preventing the activation of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak. Eventually, Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 163 the activated BH3-only protein will overcome the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, thereby triggering the death process by direct activation of Bax/Bak or, possi- bly, activation of some other unknown factor in the cytosol or mitochondria required for Bax/Bak activation [172]. Interestingly, in some circumstances, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are targets of caspases, and cleavage of these proteins converts them from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic molecules that are able to induce cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, which could be the fourth model of Bcl2-regulated apoptosis [173–175]. Once pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax or Bak) translocate to the mitochondria cytochrome c release and caspase activa- tion occur [176]. Cytochrome c release was highly associated with induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and disruption of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (DCm) [177]. Cytochrome c released from mito- chondria forms a complex with Apaf-1 in the cytosol and inactive caspase-9 [178–180]. In the presence of dATP or ATP, this complex processes and acti- vates the caspase-9, which in turn triggers a cascade by processing and activat- ing other caspases (in particular, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7) [180, 181]. These activated caspases then cleave key substrates and coordinate the process of apoptotic cell death. Bcl-2 overexpression is a common phenomenon in many malignant tumors such as non-Hodgkin’s follicular B-cell lymphoma, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, renal cancer, neuroblastoma, acute and chronic leukemia, and skin cancer [182]. Bcl-2 inhibition of cyto- chrome c release and stabilization of mitochondrial function are associated with the resistance to chemotherapy- and radiation-induced apoptosis [3]. There- fore, strategies targeting the intrinsic apoptosis pathway have focused on Bcl-2 family proteins [183]. To date, several approaches have been used to target the proteins of Bcl-2 family [184], and a select group of strategies that have shown promise in preclinical as well as clinical studies are indicated in Table 3. In general, various strategies thus far have been focused in either downregulating expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of protein by means of antisense- dependent methods, peptide or small molecule mimetics of BH3 domain, or small molecule agents to interfere with Bcl-2 functions. Since Bcl-2 does not protect against GSH-dependent loss of DCm and cell death induced by the thiol- crosslinking agent diazenedicarboxylic acid bis 5N,N-dimethylamide or the GSH-depleting agent diethylmaleate [185, 186] a potential way to overcome the anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-2 may be to develop drugs designed to deplete mitochondrial GSH levels and induce mitochondrial protein oxidation and cell death [184]. It has been reported that PK11195, prototypic ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, has been able to reverse the resistance to apoptosis in cells that overexpress Bcl-2 by activating the mitochondrial permeability transition [187], suggesting a novel strategy for enhancing the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis induction and, concomitantly, for reversing Bcl-2-mediated cytoprotection. Bcl-2-targeted antisense therapy represents a promising new apoptosis-modulating strategy [188, 189]. For example, Zangemeister-Wittke et al. [190] identified a bispecific antisense oligonucleotide 164 A.K.

Rishi et al. corresponding to a sequence that is highly homologous in Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL mRNAs but missing in Bcl-XS mRNA. This antisense oligonucleotide effec- tively killed a diverse type of cancer cells. Another approach by Taylor et al. [191] exploited the fact that Bcl-X gene is differentially spliced to give rise to Bcl-XL and Bcl-XS mRNAs encoding the anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins, respectively. The antisense targeting the region proximal to the splice donor site essential for the generation of mature Bcl-XL mRNA triggered the splicing complex to produce mainly the mRNA for short (Bcl-XS) variant. This agent caused reduced Bcl-XL/Bcl-XS ratio, and sensitized cancer cells to UV- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The most clinically advanced anti-Bcl-2 therapy, the antisense agent oblimersen, has reached phase III development. Results have been encouraging in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with improved response and remission rates and prolonged progression-free survival [189]. Other promising results have been observed among patients with advanced, relapsed melanoma, with the evidence of prolonged overall survival [192]. An alternative to inhibiting Bcl-2 to activate apoptosis has been to target pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and peptides to mitochondria. For example, gene therapy employing adenoviral Bax-delivering vectors has been successful in activating mitochondrial apoptosis [193–195]. Because protein interaction between BCL-2 members is a prominent mechanism of control and is mediated through the amphipathic alpha-helical BH3 segment, an essential death domain the stapled peptides, called ‘‘stabilized alpha-helix of BCL-2 domains’’ are designed to specifically bind to multidomain BCL-2 member pockets to block the action of Bcl-2 and activate Bax and Bak [196]. Multiple studies have focused on developing peptide mimetics of the BH3 domains and their delivery by cationic lipids as well as their conjugation with protein transduction domains [197], fatty acids. Direct delivery of Bad peptide together with decanoic acid to enhance cell permeability was found to induce apoptosis in tumor cells without harming normal human peripheral lymphocytes [198]. High-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries has yielded several small molecules to target functions of the Bcl-2 family proteins. For instance, tetrocarcin-A (TC-A), an antibiotic from Actinomyces was isolated and found to sensitize Bcl-2-overexpressing HeLa cells to death receptor- and staurosporine- mediated apoptosis [199]. Wang et al. [200] identified a compound (HA14-1) that competed with Bak for binding with Bcl-2 and in turn induced apoptosis in HL60 cells. Similar approaches resulted in identification of antimycin A3, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport chain, that targeted the BH3 pocket and induced apoptosis in Bcl-2- and Bcl-XL-overexpressing cancer cells [201]. HTS of a library of pre-selected compounds yielded BH3 inhibitors that disrupt Bcl-XL complex and cause decreased mitochondrial membrane potential to promote apoptosis [202], while Chan et al. [203] similarly identified a natural alkaloid chelerythrine that inhibited Bcl-XL/Bak-BH3 interaction and suppressed growth of Bcl-2- and Bcl-XL-overexpressing cells. In addition, several promising small molecule antagonists of Bcl-2 are in early development. The R-(-)-gossypol Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 167 derivative AT-101, a BH3 mimetic, is in phase I testing, as is ABT-263, a small molecule that binds with subnanomolar affinity to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-W. Both molecules have demonstrated single-agent activity and an additive effect in combination with cytotoxic agents in preclinical studies [204, 205]. GX-15-070 (obatoclax), which is reported to inhibit all five members of the Bcl-2 family, is in phase II clinical trials [206]. 7 P53 and Strategies Targeting Its Functional Activation P53, commonly referred to as the gatekeeper of the genome, was discovered in 1979 and subsequently classified as a tumor suppressor protein. This classifica- tion was based on a large body of experimental evidence derived from a wealth of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating loss of p53 or presence of its mutations in a variety of tumors, along with the observations showing suppres- sion of cell growth and transformation following ectopic overexpression of p53 [207]. Thus, loss of p53 function, and the fact that different stress and DNA damaging signals often activate p53 to induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, led to emergence of approaches to restore wild-type p53 functions in tumors harboring mutant p53. These include targeting of p53 mutants by small mole- cules to induce conformational changes that favor its growth inhibitory func- tions [208], synthetic peptides derived from its C-terminus that interact with the core domain of the mutant p53 and restore growth-inhibitory transcriptional functions of p53 [209, 210]. Additional strategies have been reported to deliver functional p53 by using the protein transduction domains (PTD) or the anti- DNA monoclonal antibodies in order to restore tumor suppressor function of p53 in vitro as well as in preclinical mouse model of colon cancer metastasis [211–214]. Strategies to stabilize p53 and to restore its tumor suppressor function have also included targeting its binding with the negative regulator Mdm2. The E3 ligase activity of Mdm2 protein is responsible for proteasomal degradation of Mdm2-bound p53 that results in loss of p53 expression and consequent func- tion. In addition, E6 protein of human papillomaviruses (HPV) induces p53 degradation with the help of cellular E3 ligase. Hence, targeting of Mdm2 binding with p53 and/or E3 ligase function of Mdm2 to prevent p53 degrada- tion are therefore attractive approaches to restoring p53 function. Synthetic peptide aptamers that compete for HPV E6 binding with p53 have been found to promote apoptosis-inducing function of p53 in HPV-positive cervical can- cers [215] while small molecule antagonists of Mdm2 E3 ligase function have been identified and evaluated as potential anti-cancer agents [216]. Several peptide-based mimetics that specifically interfere with p53–Mdm2 interactions have also been reported and tested for their anti-cancer properties in vitro as well as animal xenograft models [217]. Virtual database screening strategies identified a number of non-peptide small molecule inhibitors of p53–Mdm2 168 A.K. Rishi et al. interaction. The prominent examples include the imidazoline compounds called nutlins [218, 219], a benzodiazepine-based inhibitor [220], and spiro-oxindole- based inhibitor [221]. NCI compound library search further yielded a furan derivative termed RITA that was found to interfere with p53–Mdm2 binding in vitro and in vivo, and attenuated growth of colon cancer xenografts in mice [222]. Considering the facts that almost 50% of all cancers have p53 function modified by mutations or deletions [223] and the mutant p53 proteins generally do not bind Mdm2, the approaches directed to restore the function of wild-type p53 nonetheless are expected to have significant impact in designing future anti- cancer therapeutic strategies in 50% of cancers with wild-type p53. The apoptotic functions of p53 are complex and involve transcriptional regulation of pro-apoptotic genes, direct targeting of the anti- and pro- apoptotic Bcl2 family of proteins as well as the mitochondria [224]. Although p53 lacks classical mitochondrial targeting epitopes and the precise signal on p53 for its mitochondrial translocation is unknown, a variety of stress signals nevertheless are known to induce p53 translocation to mitochondria and promote outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) permeabilization, an event necessary for mitochondria-dependent apoptosis signaling. In light of the fact that the mutant p53 is known to accumulate in tumors and functions in part by antagonizing other members of its family to promote tumor growth, pharma- cological targeting of heat shock protein-90 to promote proteasomal degrada- tion of p53 mutants unfortunately had limited success due primarily to toxic side effects of HSP inhibitors [225]. Moreover, a number of studies over the last decade have suggested an intriguing, two-faced nature of the p53 protein [226]. It appears that mutations in p53 not only promote loss of its tumor suppression property but the mutant forms of p53 protein also tend to be oncogenic and a combination of loss of tumor suppression and gain of oncogenic functions contribute to development of tumors. These emergent apoptotic as well as oncogenic functions of p53 thus present novel avenues/ challenges to rationally target p53 to not only restore its wild-type functions but also, perhaps concomitantly, to effectively block oncogenic functions of its mutants. 8 Novel and Emerging Apoptosis Transducers as Targets for Anti-cancer Strategies 8.1 Nur77/TR3 Nur77 (aka TR3, NGFI-B, TIS1, and NAK-1) belongs to a subfamily within the nuclear receptor superfamily. The members of this subfamily are often classified as orphan receptors because they have no known physiological ligands [227, 228]. The other closely related members of this subfamily are Nur1 (aka RNR-1, TINUR, and HZF-3) and NOR-1 (aka MINOR, CHN, Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 169 and TEC). Structural analyses of these orphan receptors revealed absence of classical ligand pockets in their ligand-binding domains indicating that their biological functions are likely independent of the ligand binding [229, 230]. The various members of this subfamily are known to transduce diverse signals including survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. Their function/activities are regulated by their subcellular distribution, expression, post-translational mod- ifications as well as their ability to heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptors [224]. A number of reports have revealed cell survival and oncogenic functions of these receptors. Nur77 is a target of growth factor and mitogenic signaling since it is overexpressed in diverse cancer cell lines as well as in prostate cancers [231], its ectopic overexpression conferred resistance to retinoids in lung cancer cells [232], while its suppression inhibited transformed phenotype of several cancer cells in part by promoting apoptosis [233]. Apoptosis signals are also known to target the Nur77 family of receptors as indicated by studies showing their crucial involvement in the T-cell receptor- dependent apoptosis [234, 235]. The Nur77 family members are induced by antigen-receptor engagement, ischemic stress, and function in part by promot- ing apoptosis of the affected cells [236]. A large number of investigations subsequently revealed induction of Nur77 by a variety of apoptosis-promoting agents in cancer cells [175, 237–240]. The potential clinical relevance of Nur77 functions was further highlighted by the studies showing expression of its family member Nor-1 was one of the outcome predictors and was found to correlate with cured as opposed to fatal/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas [241]. Although transcriptional function of Nur77 is thought to be critical for T-cell apoptosis, several studies indicated apoptosis signaling by Nur77 by mechan- isms independent of its transcriptional functions. In this context, activation of apoptosis signaling has been shown to cause increased phosphorylation as well as translocation of Nur77 from nucleus to cytosolic compartment where it interacts with a number of Bcl-2 family members that include Bcl-2, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, and the complex targets the mitochondria for Nur77-dependent apopto- sis [175, 242, 243]. Several variations in cytoplasmic Nur77-dependent apopto- sis signaling have also been reported. For example, in colon cancer cells, the cytoplasmic relocation of Nur77 is thought to indirectly activate mitochondrial pathway by promoting Bax localization to mitochondria [244]. The mitochon- drial targeting by Nur77 has also been implicated in the neuronal cell death pathways [245]. Diverse signaling pathways regulate Nur77 function and its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling by either targeting phosphorylation of its N-terminal A/B region or its heterodimerization with RXRs [175, 242]. Although the precise mechanisms of Nur77 shuttling and mitochondrial targeting are yet to be elucidated, its inter- actions with RXRs are thought to facilitate its nuclear export in part via the nuclear export sequences (NES) of the RXRa [175]. In this context, the growth inhibitory effects of 9-cis-retinoic acid (an RXR ligand), its metabolites, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 are thought to regulate Nur77-RXRa interactions, cytoplasmic translocation, and mitochondrial 170 A.K. Rishi et al. targeting by this receptor [175, 246, 247]. Since both Nur77 and Bcl-2 family of proteins are often overexpressed in many cancers, the mechanisms regulating their interactions, translocation, and mitochondrial targeting are therefore excellent opportunities for development of anti-cancer agents that will mimic aspect(s) of apoptosis-promoting functions of Nur77. To this end, binding of Nur77 with Bcl-2 was exploited to design a Nur77-mimicking peptide that inhibited growth of myeloma cells in vitro, and the binding of this peptide with Bcl-B was recently utilized for high-throughput screening to identify novel small molecule Bcl-B inhibitors [243, 248]. 8.2 CARP-1/CCAR1 Cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory protein (CARP)-1, also known as CCAR1, is a novel regulator of apoptosis signaling. The GenBank database indicates CARP-1 proteins deduced from the nucleotide sequences of diverse species including mouse, rat, dog, chimpanzee, gallus (fowl), xenopus, honey bee, and C. elegans. Human CARP-1 gene is located at the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q21–10q22). CARP-1 transduces diverse growth inhibitory signaling, and functions in a manner independent of tumor suppressor p53 [249, 250]. CARP-1 expression correlated inversely with the breast cancer tumor grades (Table 4), and its loss in breast cancers was due in part to methylation-dependent gene silencing mechanisms [251]. Loss of CARP-1 interferes with cell growth inhibi- tion induced by adriamycin, etoposide but not by cisplatin, suggesting that CARP-1 is an important mediator of signaling by adriamycin [249]. Genetic studies in C. elegans revealed CARP-1 ortholog Lst3 is a transducer of Notch signaling that functions as a counteractor of the EGFR–MAPK pathway [252]. This function of CARP-1 as EGFR signaling antagonist was also supported in studies by Rishi et al. [250] where CARP-1 was found to regulate growth of diverse cancer cells following inhibition of EGFRs. The apoptosis signaling by EGFRs stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CARP-1 and targeted CARP-1 tyrosine 192, while CARP-1-dependent apoptosis in turn involved activation of stress-activated MAPK (SAPK) p38 and caspase-9 [250]. Breast cancer cells overexpressing CARP-1, that were generated following transfection of plasmid encoding wild-type CARP-1, formed reduced-sized tumors in the severely compromised immunodeficient (SCID) mice when compared with the tumors formed by their vector-expressing or wild-type counterparts (Fig. 2).

Consistent with the perinuclear presence of CARP-1, incubation of breast cancer cells with these affinity-purified, dena- tured TAT-tagged CARP-1 peptides resulted in the predominant localization of these peptides to the cytoplasmic/perinuclear region. The TAT-tagged CARP-1 (1–198) peptide, but not its tyrosine 192 to phenylalanine variant or TAT- tagged eGFP protein, inhibited growth of the breast cancer cells in part by inducing apoptosis in a time-dependent manner [251]. The affinity-purified, TAT-tagged CARP-1 (1–198) peptide, but not its tyrosine 192 to phenylalanine variant, also suppressed growth of breast cancer cell-derived xenografted tumors in SCID mice (Fig. 3), in part, by promoting apoptosis as evidenced by elevated TUNEL staining as well as presence of activated (phosphorylated) A B Days Post InjectionTumor Weight (mg) 400 300 200 100 0 MDA-MB-468 (wt) MDA-MB-468 MDA-MB-468 (wt) MDA-MB-468 MDA-MB-468 Clone 6.1 Subline 2 Clone 6.1 Subline 1 Clone 6.1 Subline 3 CARP-1> Actin > Vector subline 1 Clone 6.1 subline 1 Clone 6.1 subline 3 51015202530 0 Fig. 2 CARP-1 expression in breast cancer cells results in their reduced growth as xenografted tumors in SCID mice.

Rishi et al. p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in the xenograft biopsies (Fig. 4). The facts that EGFR signaling targeted CARP-1 tyrosine 192 and suppression of cell growth following attenuation of EGFRs involved elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of CARP-1 [250] strongly support a breast cancer cell growth inhibitory function of CARP-1. Phosphopeptide mapping studies further revealed that CARP-1 is a serine phospho-protein, and although the epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as the ATM kinase signaling phosphorylates specific serine residues of CARP-1 [253–255], the extent this CARP-1 serine phosphorylation modulates its function in regulating cell growth is yet to be clarified. In light of the fact that serine/threonine phosphorylation of pro- apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins often promotes their binding with and sequestration by the 14-3-3 proteins to allow cell growth and survival and the facts that CARP-1 binds with 14-3-3 [249] and is also a part of the NFkB proteome [256], it remains to be elucidated whether its serine phosphorylation is crucial for its interactions with 14-3-3 and the extent this interaction regulates NFkB signaling. Mutagenesis studies nonetheless revealed the presence of multiple, non-redundant apoptosis-promoting epitopes within CARP-1, sug- gesting that diverse apoptosis signals likely target this protein [250]. Consistent with the perinuclear presence of CARP-1, a broader role of CARP-1 in transcriptional regulation has also been recently described [257]. These studies not only elaborated CARP-1 as a key regulator of mediator complex recruitment to the estrogen receptor (ER)-a and glucocorticoid recep- tor for nuclear receptor target gene activation but was also found to be a co-activator of tumor suppressor p53 in regulating DNA damage-induced Fig. 3 His-TAT-HA-CARP-1 (1-198) protein inhibits growth of human breast cancer cell- derived tumor xenografts in SCID mice. The wild-type breast cancer cells were xenografted subcutaneously in each flank.

[251]) Apoptosis Signaling Pathways and Their Mediators 173 transcriptional upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1. Thus, like Nur77, the studies by Kim et al. [257] reveal a dual role for CARP-1 in supporting hormone-dependent transcriptional activation for cell proliferation as well as in apoptosis induction following DNA damage. The fact that peptides derived from CARP-1 inhibit growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and xeno- grafted tumors in part by inducing apoptosis [251] suggests that the apoptosis signaling mechanisms by CARP-1 could potentially be exploited to identify/ develop strategies for effective targeting of a range of cancers. Given that \u000250% of all cancers harbor mutant p53, the mutant forms of p53 are often oncogenic with altered transcriptional activation of target genes and contribute to malignant phenotype [226], and in cancers where nuclear receptor signaling is compromised such as the triple negative (i.e., lacking ER, HER-2, and progester- one receptor) as well as hormone-resistant breast cancers, the elucidation of the molecular basis of diverse cell growth and apoptosis signaling by CARP-1 could Fig. 4 Inhibition of human breast cancer cell-derived xenograft growth by His-TAT-HA-CARP-1 (1-198) protein involves elevated apoptosis. The formalin-fixed tumor xenograft biopsies from the experiment in Fig. 3 were paraffin embedded, processed, and subsequently subjected to immunohistochemical staining for determination of apoptosis. The representative photomicrographs showing intratumoral presence (brown color) of respective peptides are indicated by staining with anti-HA-tag antibodies (left).

[251]) 174 A.K. Rishi et al. potentially help in designing improved perhaps novel strategies for effective targeting of these cancers. 9 Concluding Remarks A wealth of scientific investigations that have focused on elucidating the mechanisms regulating cell growth and proliferation suggest that cancer cells have activated and/or dysregulated signaling for growth and proliferation. Although cancer cell homeostasis involves different modes of cell death that include necrosis, autophagy, mitotic catastrophe, and apoptosis, increasing body of evidence indicates that inhibitory pathways such as apoptosis are often compromised in a variety of cancers. These conclusions are based, in part, on the fact that a preponderance of the current chemotherapeutics elim- inates cancer cells by activating intrinsic and/or extrinsic apoptosis programs. It is therefore, not entirely surprising to find that a significant number of drug- resistant cancer phenotypes often arise due to defects in the intrinsic or extrinsic apoptosis programs. Accordingly, elucidating/understanding of the mechan- isms activating chemotherapy-dependent apoptosis signaling networks in cancer cells, tumors, and animal models can be exploited to develop novel apoptosis-based anti-cancer strategies. Identification of cancer cell apoptosis defects by comparative DNA as well as proteomic analyses together with novel mediators/effectors of apoptosis signaling will permit development of agents for use alone or in combination with current therapeutics to effectively elim- inate cancer cells and, in turn, restore sensitivity of the resistant forms of cancers.

Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics Kyung H. Choi and Michel M. Ouellette 1 Introduction Telomerase is responsible for the maintenance of telomeres, specialized struc- tures that cap the ends of chromosomes. Because most human cells lack telomerase, telomeres shorten each time cells divide and this attrition acts as a clock that limits their lifespan. During cancer development, this limited lifespan is almost always bypassed by the reactivation of telomerase, the enzyme respon- sible for the synthesis of telomeres. This upregulation of telomerase provides the cancer cells with cellular immortality or ability to proliferate for an unlim- ited number of cell divisions. Inhibitors of the enzyme telomerase have been developed to reverse this immortal phenotype and limit the lifespan of cancer cells. Following conventional chemotherapy, these inhibitors could be used to prevent the regrowth of residual disease and reduce the incidence of recurrence. In this chapter, we discuss the development of the first such inhibitor to enter clinical trials, GRN163L. The inhibitor, a lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide developed by Geron Corporation (Menlo Park, CA), inhibits telomerase in a wide range of cancer cell lines. In mice bearing human tumor cells, GRN163L can reduce tumor growth and metastasis. In this chapter, we discuss the devel- opment of GRN163L, its mechanism of action, and its potential value in the treatment of cancer patients. In the second half, we discuss anticipated challenges associated with the development of these new drugs, from the search for new compounds to the testing and optimization of current inhibitors. 2 Human Telomeres Act as a Mitotic Clock Telomeres are essential structures that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Human telomeres are made of a simple DNA repeat, (TTAGGG)n [1, 2]. These repeats serve as anchor for the recruitment of sequence-specific DNA-binding M.M.

Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_6, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 189 factors TRF1, TRF2, and POT1. Through protein–protein interactions, these factors recruit several other proteins to telomeres, with which they form a large capping complex. This complex is needed to protect chromosomal ends from degradation, interchromosomal fusions, and other forms of inadequate recom- bination [1, 3]. A second vital function of telomeres is to hide chromosomal ends from DNA damage-sensing mechanisms, which would otherwise sense them as double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks [1]. In human cells, the presence of just one such break can activate DNA damage checkpoints and lead to either senescence or apoptosis. Telomeres end with G-rich single-stranded 30-overhang of 50–300 bases. Evidence suggests that this extension is sequestered into a large looping structure, termed a T-loop [1, 4]. Formation of this structure involves the looping of the telomere and the insertion of its 30-telomeric overhang into upstream duplex telomeric DNA [1, 5, 6]. It has been proposed that T-loops are especially well adapted to shield the ends of telomeres from DNA damage- sensing mechanisms and other biochemical activities. Maintenance of telomeres requires telomerase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats. In cells that lack telomerase, telomeres shorten each time cells divide and this attrition acts as a mitotic clock that limits cellular lifespan [7– 9]. Telomeres shorten because of a number of problems associated with the replication of linear DNA molecules (the so-called ‘‘end replication problems’’). As replication forks approach the ends of linear DNA, problems are encountered with both the lagging and the leading strand synthesis. On the lagging strand, priming of the last Okazaki fragment can occur internally and removal of the RNA primer creates a gap, which cannot be filled for lack of an upstream primer. On the leading strand, postreplication processing is needed to regenerate a single-stranded 3 0-telomeric overhang that can be used as a substrate for T-loop formation and POT1 binding (an ssDNA-binding protein). The net result is the production of daughter chromatids that contain gaps of unreplicated DNA, causing telomeres to shorten each time cells divide [7, 9]. When the shortest telomere reaches a threshold size, it becomes uncapped and is recognized as a ds-DNA break. In primary human cells possessing functional DNA damage checkpoints, this presence of such an unrepairable break elicits one of two responses: senescence or apoptosis [10, 11]. Because they lack telomerase or have insufficient level of enzyme to maintain telomeres, somatic human cells lose telomeres with cell divisions and, as a conse- quence, have a limited lifespan. During cancer development, this limited lifespan poses an obstacle that the tumor cells have to overcome on their way to become malignant. In the great majority of cancers, overcoming this barrier is achieved by means of telomerase expression. 3 Telomerase Extends Cellular Lifespan Telomerase can compensate the effects of the end replication problems and extend the lifespan of human cells. The enzyme solves these problems by the synthesis and addition of new telomeric repeats to its substrate, the 30-telomeric 190 K.H. Choi and M.M. Ouellette overhangs [12]. The enzyme has the ability to make DNA without primers or DNA templates. It solves this problem by carrying its own internal template in the form of an RNA component. The human enzyme contains two essential subunits: the protein hTERT (human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase) and the small nuclear RNA hTR (human Telomerase RNA). The first provides catalytic activity and the second contains a short sequence (5 0-CUAACC- CUAA-30) that serves as a template for the synthesis of telomeric repeats (Fig. 1). The enzyme functions as a reverse transcriptase and uses the RNA hTR as a template to add telomeric DNA repeats to the 30-telomeric overhangs [12]. In cells that lack telomerase activity, the hTERT component is missing whereas hTR is ubiquitously expressed, irrespective of telomerase activity [13]. In primary human cells lacking telomerase activity, the forced expression of telomerase is sufficient to reconstitute telomerase activity and maintain telomeres [14]. In primary human cells, expression of hTERT can overcome senescence, extend cellular lifespan, and provide cells with immortality [15–17]. These hTERT-expressing cells are capable of indefinite cell divisions but tend to maintain their normal growth properties, chromosome number, and capacity to differentiate [18, 19]. Fig. 1 Activity of telomerase and its inhibition by GRN163L. Telomerase is a reverse tran- scriptase that uses an internal RNA template (10 nucleotides; white letters over dark gray box) to synthesize (dotted arrow; RT) a 6-base telomeric DNA repeat. GRN163L hybridizes to the template region of telomerase and to surrounding nucleotides to block the activity of the enzyme Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics 191 4 Telomerase Expression in Normal and Cancerous Tissues Telomerase activity is typically measured using the Telomeric Repeat Amplifi- cation Protocol (TRAP) assay. In the TRAP assay, products of the telomerase reaction are quantified following their PCR amplification [20, 21]. The assay is exquisitely sensitive and incorporates an internal standard (ITAS) with which to normalize signals for differences in PCR efficiency. Telomerase activity is calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the telomeric products to that of the ITAS. With this assay, telomerase activity can be measured in a wide range of specimens, from tissue biopsies to cell pellets [22]. High throughput assays have been developed to adapt the telomerase assay to the clinical environment. Many of these new assays take advantage of fluorophores that alleviate the use of radioisotopes and facilitate the quantification of PCR products. At the early stages of human development, telomerase activity is ubiquitously expressed throughout the embryo [23, 24]. At this stage, telomerase is needed to reset telomere length and allow for the massive numbers of cell divisions needed to complete embryogenesis. But by birth, telomerase activity becomes absent from most somatic tissues, with the exception of the blood, skin, and gastro- intestinal track [23, 24]. In these renewal tissues, tissue homeostasis is maintained by the continuous proliferation and differentiation of endogenous stem cells. To support this need for continued proliferation throughout life, active telomerase is needed. The enzyme is activated transiently during the differentiation of these normal stem cells [25]. This activation, however, is not sufficient to prevent the attrition of telomeres or lead to cellular immortality. As in all proliferative tissues, telomeres shorten with age in these renewal tissues [26]. Cancer is a notable exception to the universal shortening of telomeres in normal human tissues. Human cancer cells have in common that they possess mechanisms that block telomere attrition to give them immortality. In more than 85% of cancers, irrespective of the tumor type, this mechanism is the upregulation of telomerase activity [9, 27, 28]. Malignancies that develop from telomerase-negative tissues are almost always positive for the activity. Even in cancer cells originating from telomerase-positive precursors, telomerase is almost always upregulated. Yet, a small percent of cancer specimens has no detectable telomerase activity. In cancer cells that lack the activity, an alternate mechanism of telomere maintenance can be activated [29]. This other mechanism, termed ALT (alternate maintenance of telomeres), uses gene conversion events that use longer telomeres as template to elongate shorter ones. This ability to maintain telomeres is a fundamental property of cancer cells, which normal somatic human cells do not possess. This lack of telomere attrition gives cancer cells their cellular immortality or capacity for unlimited number of cell divisions. This transition to immortality is needed to allow the many stages of carcinogenesis to proceed unimpeded by senescence and to give the resulting cancer cells the ability to invade without being halted by the induction of senescence or crisis [9, 30]. Because most cancer cells are immortal as a result of telomerase reactivation, targeting telomerase is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. 192 K.H. Choi and M.M. Ouellette 5 Telomerase Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy 5.1 Telomerase Inhibition and the Viability of Cancer Cells Inhibiting telomerase in telomerase-expressing cancer cells causes the telomeres to shorten, and when sufficient telomeres have become uncapped, the cancer cells will experience one of two antiproliferative barriers – either senescence or crisis [31– 34]. The two barriers are different and whether cancer cell experience one or the other is dictated by the functionality of their DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoints [2, 9]. Senescence is a viable but irreversible state of permanent cell cycle arrest. Crisis is a form of p53-independent apoptosis, which for the purpose of killing cancer cells, represents the preferred outcome. Cells that possess functional checkpoints, such as primary human cells, undergo senescence as soon as the shortest telomere has become uncapped. When uncapped, this short telomere will be recognized as a ds-DNA break by the DNA damage-sensing machinery, and this recognition will lead to the activa- tion of the ATM kinase, phosphorylation of p53, and induction of cell cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 [2, 10]. A late response involving the induction of p16INK4a and downstream activation of tumor suppressor pRB will also be observed [2, 9, 35]. The net result is an irreversible cell cycle arrest and establishment of the senescent state. Akin to terminal differentiation, senescence will be accompa- nied by changes in morphology and gene expression. In cells that lack func- tional checkpoints, senescence fails to be observed and the cells will continue to divide in spite of uncapped telomeres [9]. During this extended lifespan, how- ever, the telomeres will continue to shorten for lack of active telomerase. When sufficient numbers of terminally shortened telomeres have accumulated, a state of crisis characterized by massive cell death is induced. Terminally shortened telomeres are highly reactive and will recombine with one another to produce sister chromatid fusions and dicentric chromosomes. At anaphase, these fusions fail to segregate and resolving the anaphase bridges that result leads to more chromosome breakage. The net result is a form of mitotic failure accompanied by the induction of p53-independent apoptosis [36]. Because they lack func- tional checkpoints as a result of mutations affecting the p53 and/or p16INK4a/ pRB pathways, most cancer cells will undergo crisis rather than senescence after continuous telomerase inhibition [31– 34]. An important prediction is the expectation of a delay in the actions of telomerase inhibitors. Because sufficient telomere shortening needs to occur for senescence and crisis to be induced, the effects of telomerase inhibition will be observed only after the treated cancer cells have done sufficient number of cell divisions [2, 37]. Because of their delayed action, telomerase inhibitors are not going to be useful as a primary line of treatment. But to block the regrowth of residual disease after standard therapy, these inhibitors should be most valuable (Fig. 2). To produce recurrent tumors, surviving cancer cells need to undergo massive numbers of cell divisions. In the presence of a telomerase inhibitor, the Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics 193 several rounds of cell divisions needed for residual cancer cells to produce a recurrent tumor will almost certainly lead to the accumulation of critically short telomeres and the induction of crisis. Telomerase inhibitors are the first new class of drug especially designed to reduce the incidence of recurrence when used in combination with conventional cancer therapy. 5.2 GRN163L, a First Telomerase Inhibitor For inhibiting telomerase, the template region of the human telomerase RNA (hTR) presents an accessible target for oligonucleotide-based inhibitors [38– 41]. As shown previously, telomerase can be inhibited by oligonucleotides that hybridize to the template region of its RNA component (Fig. 1). In one study, telomerase in immortal human breast epithelial cells was inhibited with peptide nucleic acid and 20-methoxy oligomers [42]. Repeated transfection leads to progressive telomere shortening and caused cells to undergo apoptosis with increasing frequency until no cells remained. More recently, several N30-P50 thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotides complementary to the template of hTR have been used as potential telomerase inhibitors [43]. These compounds are water soluble, acid stable, resistant to nucleases, and demonstrate high thermal stability of duplexes formed with their complementary RNA strands [31, 43– 46]. One compound GRN163 caused telomerase inhibition and subsequent telomere shortening in many cancer cell lines [31, 46– 50]. As with most anionic oligonucleotides, repeated transfection of GRN163 with cationic lipophilic carriers was required for efficient intracellular uptake, as naked oligonucleo- tides are poorly internalized. A second generation of GRN163 analogues, modified by lipidation, was made to facilitate cellular uptake. One such Fig. 2 Therapeutic potential of telomerase inhibitors GRN163L to block disease recurrence. Because sufficient telomere attrition needs to occur before telomerase-inhibited cancer cells reach crisis, the effects of telomerase inhibitors will be delayed until the target cells have done sufficient numbers of cell divisions. This delay, which may preclude their use as a first line of treatment, should not reduce the ability of these compounds to block the regrowth of residual disease. After conventional therapy, telomerase inhibitors could be used to reduce the inci- dence of recurrences and promote long-term survival 194 K.H. Choi and M.M. Ouellette compound, GRN163L, is a GRN163 oligonucleotide modified to carry a 5 0- terminal palmitoyl (C16) moiety conjugated to the N3 0-P5 0thio-phosphoramidate backbone (5 0-palmitate-TAGGGTTAGACAA-NH2-3 0; Fig. 3) [49]. GRN163L is lipid soluble and does not rely on any membrane transporter for cellular uptake. When compared to GRN163, GRN163L displayed greatly improved cellular uptake, inhibition of telomerase, and rate of telomere shortening [46, 48, 49]. 5.3 Clinical and Preclinical Studies of GRN163L The short- and long-term effects of GRN163L have been studied in both cultured cancer cells and mice bearing human tumor xenografts. With IC50 in the nanomolar range, GRN163L was found to inhibit telomerase in a wide variety of cancer cell lines. Within 24 hours of its addition to the culture media, GRN163L inhibits telomerase [49]. In cancer cells chronically exposed to GRN163L, telomeres shorten with cell divisions [31]. After a delay, continuous exposure to the drug leads to crisis, as evidenced by the presence of chromoso- mal fusions, anaphase bridges, and widespread apoptosis. This capacity of GRN163L to limit lifespan was reported in cancer cell lines of diverse origins, including multiple myeloma and tumors of the bladder, breast, liver, lung, and stomach [31, 48, 51– 54]. In mice bearing human tumor xenografts, GRN163L was determined to be efficacious and well tolerated. The maximum tolerated dose was 1000 mg/kg and telomerase inhibition could already be detected with just 5 mg/kg [31]. In biodistribution studies, 35S-labeled GRN163L spread to most, if not all, mouse tissues and was still present after 72 hours [31]. A week after a single dose of GRN163L at 30 mg/kg, 60% telomerase inhibition was still observed. In a xenograft model of lung cancer metastasis, administration of a single dose of GRN163L (15 mg/kg) could reduce the growth of lung Fig. 3 Chemical structure of GRN163L. GRN163L is an N3 0-P50 thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide complementary to the template of hTR. Three of the 13 nucleotides (5 0- palmitate-TAGGGTTAGACAA-NH2-3 0) are shown. Nucleotidic bases (A, C, G, or T) are shown as B. To facilitate cellular uptake, the 50-end has been modified to carry a 5 0-terminal palmitoyl (C16) moiety Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics 195 metastases [31]. In mice carrying liver cancer xenografts, systemic administra- tion of GRN163L inhibited tumor growth and sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents [48]. On the basis of these preclinical results, GRN163L has now entered phase I and II clinical trials in patients with cancer. Phase I trials with dose escalation are underway in patients with solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00310895) and chronic lymphocytic leuke- mia (NCT00124189). Other trials in patients with multiple myeloma (NCT00594126), lung (NCT00510445) and breast (NCT00732056) cancer have just recently begun to recruit patients. These trials are designed to assess safety, determine the maximum tolerated dose, and identify dose-limiting toxi- cities. Some are combined phase I/II trials, which have been designed to evaluate the ability of GRN163L to inhibit telomerase systemically, in both tumor specimens and normal surrogate tissues. 6 Challenges in the Clinical Application of Telomerase Inhibitors Telomerase inhibitors are just beginning to find their way into human clinical trials. How efficacious and what side effects these inhibitors will have in real patients is difficult to predict. As with most new drugs, the transition from preclinical to clinical studies would be expected to come with its own set of new challenges. In the next sections, we discuss five areas that will necessitate further investigation to ensure the best possible results in patients. 6.1 Measuring the Effects on Recurrences After Conventional Therapy Unlike conventional cancer drugs, telomerase inhibitors are not expected to produce an immediate response. Because sufficient telomere shortening needs to occur before these inhibitors can induce senescence or apoptosis, these effects should be observed only after the exposed cancer cells have done sufficient number of cell divisions [2, 37]. For this reason, telomerase inhibitors are expected to have a delayed action, and as a consequence, are unlikely to be efficacious as a fist line of treatment. These inhibitors, on the other hand, should be most useful to block the growth of locally advanced disease or to inhibit the regrowth of residual disease following conventional therapy. Clinical trials to assess the value of these inhibitors should be designed to reflect this mode of action. Rather than using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria to detect an immediate tumor response, these inhibitors should be tested for their ability to extend lifespan and reduce the incidence the recurrence. An ideal cohort would be patients with minimal disease for which a measurable chance of recurrent disease is anticipated. Long-term exposure of these patients to GRN163L would be expected to extend survival and progression-free survival as well as reduce the 196 K.H. Choi and M.M. Ouellette incidence of relapses. This need to follow patients over extended period to detect differences in survival and recurrence could impede progression toward determin- ing the best dose and schedule and identifying the standard therapies that synergize with GRN163L. A second challenge will be to overcome the need to show evidence of efficacy in early clinical trials. Phase I/II trials tend to be conducted in patients with advanced disease, the worst possible cohort with which to test the value of telomerase inhibitors. Overcoming this obstacle might require the use of more sensitive methods to allow detection of weak responses in the context of short-term treatment. 6.2 Targeting the Cancer Stem Cells Telomerase inhibitors will be especially valuable to block the regrowth of residual disease after conventional cancer therapy, as a means of reducing the incidence of recurrences. But for these inhibitors to be effective, they will need to target the specific subset of cancer cells that give rise to recurrent disease. Mounting evidence suggests that, in certain forms of cancer, recurrences are the products of the survival of residual cancer cells that possess properties of stem cells. The consensus definition of a cancer stem cell is a cell within a tumor that can self-renew and regenerate all of the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise a tumor [55]. Rare cells that fall within this definition have been identified in a growing number of diseases, from hematological malignancies to brain, breast, and pancreatic cancer [56–58]. Conventional therapies have been optimized for the killing of bulk tumor cells, not necessarily for the targeting of the cancer stem cells. As the current literature suggests, cancer stem cells can express high levels of multidrug-resistant pumps, which can provide protection from the effects of certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as gemcitabine [58, 59]. Therefore, an important question is whether GRN163L can target these cells efficiently. Alas, little is known of the effects of GRN163L on cancer stem cells, as past studies have all been focused on the effects of the drug on bulk tumor cells. An important challenge will be to test the effects of telomerase inhibitors in cancer stem cells, especially those that may be present in solid tumors. As cancer stem cells are identified in growing numbers of malignancies, markers to isolate these cells are being identified (CD133, CD24, ESA1, CD44, and ALDH1). With the help of these markers, it will be possible to study the effect of GRN163L on cancer stem cells. To be able to reconstitute tumors, a critical property of these cells is their ability to self-renew. One prediction would be that if GRN163L inhibits telomerase in cancer stem cells, their telomeres will shorten and this attrition will interfere with their self-renewal. To measure the self-renewal of cancer stem cells, a serial transplantation assay is typically used [56–58]. Cancer stem cells are isolated and implanted into mice until tumor forms. For these tumors the same cancer stem cells are reisolated, which are then transferred to a second-generation mice. Cancer stem cells are often Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics 197 passaged for up to six such transplantations while maintaining their high tumorigenicity and capacity to reconstitute the histopathological complexity of the original tumor. Studies are in progress in several laboratories, including ours, that will use this assay to define the activities of GRN163L on cancer stem cells. These studies should determine whether cancer stem cells have detoxifica- tion mechanisms that may prevent the compounds from being able to target the cancer stem cells. 6.3 Impact of Telomerase Inhibitors on Normal Renewal Tissues Telomerase activity is by no means limited to cancer cells. Low levels of telomerase activity are present in a limited number of normal tissues, including the skin, blood, lung, and gastrointestinal track. These renewal tissues require low-level telomerase activity to allow for the massive number of cell divisions needed to maintain tissue homeostasis throughout the life of an individual. We know little about how these normal telomerase-positive tissues will respond to antitelomerase therapies. In preclinical studies, GRN163L was tested in mice carrying human tumors cells but because laboratory mice have much longer telomeres than humans (40–60 kb instead of 2–20 kb) [25], these studies failed to delineate the side effects of the compound on the normal mouse tissues. Studies have been done in Rhesus monkeys, which share with humans a similar biology of telomeres and telomerase, but these studies have looked only at the short- term effects of GRN163L [60]. The effects of the lack of telomerase in renewal tissues are exemplified in the symptoms of patients that carry mutations in components of the telomerase complex, alternatively affecting hTR, hTERT, or dyskerin [12, 61]. These patients have 50% of normal telomerase level, and this haploinsufficiency accelerates the shortening of telomeres in renewal tissues. Short telomeres in these patients have been implicated in a variety of disorders, which include dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, and idiopathic pulmon- ary fibrosis [61– 65]. A first key feature of these diseases is the observation that they affect tissues that normally express telomerase. Bone marrow failure leading to premature death is a common characteristic of aplastic anemia and dyskeratosis congenital, with the latter disorder also presenting with mucocu- taneous abnormalities. In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the bronchial epithelium fails to self-renew and is replaced gradually with connec- tive tissue [65]. A second key feature of these diseases is the relatively long latency observed before symptoms develop, which varies from 6 to 60 years [61]. This latency suggests that years of uninterrupted telomerase inhibition may be required before declines in renewal tissue function are noted. The wide range of clinical presentations seen in patients with mutations in telomerase complex components provides an overview of the possible side effects arising from long- term exposure to telomerase inhibitors. In future clinical trials, this knowledge 198 K.H. Choi and M.M. Ouellette should help provide a framework with which to assess the risks of antitelomer- ase therapies. To help predict the risk–benefit ratio of antitelomerase therapy, an impor- tant question is whether cancer cells will be more acutely targeted than the normal renewal tissues. Several key observations have been made that support the idea that these drugs will have the required specificity. First, telomerase in renewal tissues does not appear to be expressed by the most primitive stem cells [25]. In hair follicles and gastrointestinal crypts, for example, the activity is restricted to the transiently amplifying cells [25, 66]. These cells, which are born out of the asymmetric division of the more primitive stem cells, are lineage-restricted progenitors. It is the proliferation and differentiation of these progenitors that give rise to a functional tissue. Because they lack telomerase, the more primitive stem cells should not be affected directly by the presence of a telomerase inhibitor. If so, then renewal tissues should resist the effects of these drugs far better than most cancers would, as cancer specimens tend to be uniformly positive for the activity of telomerase. A second key observation is that cancer specimens, as a general rule, have shorter telomeres than normal tissues [67]. So why should cancer cells have short telomeres if they express telomerase? Cancer cells reactivate telomerase as a mean of escaping crisis, when their telomeres have become critically short, and it may be that once reactivated, telomerase is expressed at levels that are insufficient to re-elongate the telomeres. In cancer cells that divide rapidly, these short telomeres should first become uncapped after telomerase inhibition, much before the telomeres of normal telomerase-expressing cells. Even more promising is the recent discovery that certain cancer cells arbor T-stumps, a distinct class of extremely short telomeres with just a few telo- meric repeats [68]. During GRN163L therapy, the almost immediate uncap- ping of these T-stumps would therefore be expected to provide a more selective and rapid response toward the killing of cancer cells. However encouraging the preclinical studies may be, understanding the risks and benefits of antitelomerase therapy will need to await completion of the first clinical trials. These preclinical studies, performed in mice and with cultured human cells, did little to help predict the effects of telomerase inhibitors on renewal tissues. As a result, much remains to be learned and so many key questions are left to be answered. How will normal telomerase-expressing tissues respond to telomerase inhibition? How long will we be able to treat patients before causing irreversible damages to their renewal tissues? Could the use of these drugs lead to a premature aging of the renewal tissues, which may not be discernable until later in life? Will the adverse effects be more pro- nounced in older individuals who may have shorter telomeres? None of these problems can be modeled using laboratory mice. GRN163L is now entering clinical trials and an important challenge will be to design future trials to address all of these outstanding concerns. Future trials will need to monitor renewal tissues for signs of premature aging and provide for a long-term follow- up of cancer survivors. Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics 199 6.4 Development of Resistance to Antitelomerase Therapy There has been no report yet of acquired resistance from cultured cancer cells treatedwithGRN163L,and thedrugwas foundtobeactiveinawide rangeof cancer cell lines [49]. Yet, it is fair to predict that if the compound is efficacious, a selection process will take place that will favor the emergence of resistant cells. Several mechanisms of resistance can be envisioned, some specific to GRN163L and others applicable to all forms of antitelomerase therapy. A first possible source of resistance will be the emergence of cells that take advantage of the ALT pathway (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres). In cells that use the ALT pathway, telomeres are maintained through gene conversion events that take place between long and short telomeres [29]. A subset of human tumors has already been determined to use the ALT pathway rather than telomerase. In cultures of human cells experiencing crisis, clones of ALT cells can emerge spontaneously as a result of rare mutational events (at a frequency of less than 1/10 7 cell or division). So the possibility of ALT cells arising as a consequence of long-term GRN163L exposure is a real possibility. A second possible source of resistance could come from alterations affecting the composition of the telomerase complex. Mutations in thetemplateregionofhTR couldcause GRN163Ltofailtohybridize andcould do so without blocking telomere maintenance. Change in levels of expression of hTR and hTERT could flood cells with sufficient telomerase complexes to out- compete the effects of limited amounts of GRN163L. Changes in membrane composition could interfere with the uptake and transport of the drug. The heterogeneity in the composition of tumors might be a source of additional problems. Tumors could contain rare cells that may possess longer telomeres or that may remain dormant, or quiescent, during the course of antitelomerase therapy. After therapy is discontinued, once the bulk of the tumor cells have been killed, these cells could resume cell division to give rise to recurrent disease. Identifying and cataloguing the different mechanisms of resistance to GRN163L and other telomerase inhibitors will be challenging. It may also be that mechanisms of resistance will differ whether they have been selected for in vitro, in animal models, or in real patients. Clearly, these efforts would best be pursued with samples from patients who have relapsed following long-term therapy with inhibitors of telomerase. If sources of resistance are identified in these patients, a second challenge will be to devise strategies to overcome the specific underlying mechanisms. Thus, it may be that new compounds will need to be developed to overcome as yet unforeseen mechanisms of detoxification that may limit the activities of the current telomerase inhibitors. 6.5 Development of New Antitelomerase Compounds GRN163L is the first inhibitor of telomerase to enter clinical trials. As the first prototype to be tested, GRN163L will undoubtedly be followed by the develop- ment of new derivatives with improved potency and selectivity. Already in progress 200 K.H. Choi and M.M. Ouellette at Geron Corporation (Menlo Park, CA) are several new derivatives of GRN163L with different activity profiles. In a recent study, GRN163L was reported to have both antitelomerase and antiadhesive activities [69]. When added to trypsinized cells, the compound could block reattachment of these cells to the plastic dish. These effects were determined to be independent of telomerase activity or size of telomeres. To separate the antiadhesive and antitelomerase activities of GRN163L, Geron Corporation made several new derivatives of GRN163L. The antiadhesive effect was dependent on the molecular properties of the lipid moiety, the phos- phorothioate backbone, and the presence of triplet-G sequences within the GRN163L structure [69]. Whether the antiadhesive properties of GRN163L add to its clinical value has not been determined, but Geron identified new compounds that could inhibit telomerase without blocking cell adhesion. Room for improve- ment exists for important aspects, dictating the activities of GRN163L. The lipid moiety, for example, could further be optimized to improve cellular uptake. Modifications to the oligonucleotide moiety could also be made to improve stability or increase the affinity of the compound for telomerase. It is important to realize that the ongoing search for telomerase inhibitors is by no means limited to oligonucleotides. Several new classes of compounds have so far been identified as a result of drug screening efforts and other rational design schemes. Among these are molecules designed to stabilize the formation of G-quadruplexes and others that reduce the processivity of the enzyme. The native substrate of telomerase, the 3 0-telomeric overhang, can fold into a G-quadruplex structure and formation of this structure blocks the activity of telomerase. Devel- oped through rational design, many G-quadruplex stabilizers have been found to inhibit telomerase. A leading candidate, which should soon be entering phase I clinical trial, is the acridine compound BRACO-19 [70]. The effect of this drug on the structure of the 3 0-telomeric overhang has been determined not only to inhibit telomerase but also to block the binding of POT1, an essential component of telomeres. Therefore, a major concern has been that these compounds could perturb the structure of telomeres in normal telomerase-negative cells, thereby causing widespread telomere dysfunction. Drug screening efforts have also led to the discovery of additional candidates. Two such candidates, BIBR1532 and BIBR1591, were found to inhibit the processivity of telomerase with IC50 in the nanomolar range [71]. BIBR1532 is a noncompetitive inhibitor that binds to a site distinct from the active center. Treating cancer cells with these compounds can lead to telomere dysfunction and to the induction of senescence [72, 73]. To discover promising new compounds and identify the most valuable ones, a concerted effort on the part of the public and private sectors will undoubtedly be needed. 7 Concluding Remarks GRN163L is the first telomerase inhibitor to enter clinical trial. Being a first prototype, GRN163L will be instrumental in defining the range of activities associated with these new drugs. As a new class of drugs is aimed at reducing Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics 201 recurrence following conventional treatment, telomerase inhibitors are truly unique. If GRN163L is found to be beneficial to cancer patients, this would most certainly lead to the development of second-generation inhibitors, with improved potency and selectivity. In the clinics of the future, these inhibitors could become a ubiquitous component of the standard of care for most cancers. While much remains to be learned, the potential is there for these inhibitors to revolutionize the way we treat cancer patients. References 1. de Lange T. Protection of mammalian telomeres.

Role of Telomerase in Cancer Therapeutics 205 Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs Dongin Kim and You Han Bae 1 Introduction Chemotherapy together with debulking surgery is a major treatment for cancer. There are, however, major limitations of conventional cytotoxic drugs that result from their nonspecific toxicity (e.g., the lack of selectivity) in the body and the intrinsic or acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells. To this end, polymeric drug carriers have been developed to address this nonspecificity and MDR [1]. It is believed that these drug carriers alter the biodistribution and increase the bioavailability of incorporated anticancer agents to the target cells [2]. Polymers are the most common materials that are used as drug carriers due to their diverse chemistry and safety characteristics in the body [1]. A polymer can be used to carry drugs in different manners (or forms), such as conjugates [3], dendrimers [4], nanoparticles [5], micelles [6, 7], nanogels [7], or polymer- somes [8], using a variety of delivery mechanisms. Figure 1 shows the structures of common polymer carriers. This chapter briefly reviews polymer delivery systems for anticancer drugs and is followed by a discussion of concerns about conventional anticancer drugs such as solubility, biodistribution, cytosolic drug delivery, and MDR. 2 Polymeric Drug Carriers 2.1 Conjugates Polymer–drug conjugates comprise drug molecules that are covalently linked to a polymer backbone as side groups or end groups [3]. A representative system has at least three components: a water-soluble polymer, bioactive anticancer agents, and a biodegradable spacer between the polymer and the drug [9]. Y.H. Bae (*) Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Utah, Suite 315, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, USA e-mail: you.bae@utah.edu Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_7, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 207 The polymer chemistry makes the conjugate unique and also provides diver- sity [3]. The system can be tailored by selecting the appropriate polymer and drug molecules, by changing the polymer’s molecular weight, by altering the number of drug molecules that is conjugated per polymer chain, and by intro- ducing targeting moieties and bioresponsive elements. The conjugates are then regarded as new chemical entities (NCEs) [10]. N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) metha- crylamide (HPMA) copolymer-doxorubicin (PK1; FCE28068), involved in phase I/II clinical trials, showed a significant decrease in anthracycline-related toxicity and no cardiotoxicity despite cumulative doses of up to 1680 mg/m2 (doxorubicin equivalent) [11]. More than 10 anticancer drug polymer conju- gates are now in various phases of clinical trials. 2.2 Dendrimers and Hyperbranched Polymers A dendrimer is a hyperbranched polymer molecule that has a well-defined molecular weight. It has a globular architecture with several dendrons (dendron: a tree-like polymer molecule with a trunk) that are connected to a central core. Its distinctive features include a controlled size (15 nm in diameter), multivalency, and the surface charge of ionizable dendrimer terminal groups, which can vary in the generation number [4]. One example of a dendrimer as an anticancer drug carrier is the covalent attachment of drug molecules to the dendrimer periphery, which is in a con- jugated form. The generation number of the dendrimer determines the drug Water soluble polymer backbone Environmental sensitive cleavable spacer DrugsOptional targeting ligands Drugs Hydrophilic shell Hydrophobic core Drugs Cross linked network Drugs (a) (b) (f)(e) (d)(c) Drugs Drugs Hydrophilic part Hydrophobic part Hydrophobic drugs Hydrophilic drugs Fig. 1 Various polymeric drug carriers: (a) conjugates, (b) dendrimers, (c) nanoparticles, (d) micelles, (e) nanogels, (f) polymersomes 208 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae content. The degradable linkages between the drug and the dendrimer control the release of the drug [4]. Duncan and colleagues [12] have investigated the conjugates of a polyami- doamine (PAMAM) dendrimer with cisplatin. The dendrimer–drug conjugates showed increased drug solubility, decreased systemic toxicity of the drug, and selective accumulation in solid tumors. Their results using dendrimer–platinum conjugates showed increased efficacy when compared with free cisplatin in the treatment of subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma. In addition, Zhuo et al. [13] prepared PAMAM dendrimers from a cyclic tetraamine core and subsequently attached 5-fluorouracil to the dendrimer periph- ery. These conjugates released free 5-fluorouracil on incubation in phosphate- buffered saline. The drug molecules can also be physically entrapped with a limited loading capacity in the dendrimer core (a few drug molecules per dendrimer). 2.3 Micelles Polymeric micelles, which were first introduced by Ringsdorf in 1984 [14], are an assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers in an aqueous environment. Primary polymeric micelles have a well-defined core–shell structure – a hydrophobic inner core and a hydrophilic shell. Micelles can incorporate water-insoluble drugs into the cores through chemical, physical, or electrostatic interactions [15], such as in micelles that are composed of a block copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) and polyaspartate (Fig. 2) [16–18]. A phase II study of a paclitaxel (PTX)-incorporated micelle, NK105, that is used in the treatment of stomach cancer, has begun [19]. Fig. 2 Multifunctional polymeric micelles composed of a block copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) and polyaspartate with tumor selectivity for active drug targeting and pH sensitivity for intracellular site-specific drug transport. Folic acid with high tumor affinity due to the overexpression of its receptors was conjugated onto the surface of the micelle (adapted from Ref. [114] with permission) Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 209 2.4 Nanoparticles There has been considerable interest in developing biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) for drug delivery due to their stability and controlled release properties. The size of NPs ranges from 10 to 1000 nm. NPs can be a solid sphere or a hollow capsule, depending on the fabrication methods. Nanocapsules are vesicular systems in which a drug is enclosed in a polymer cavity, while nano- spheres are matrix systems in which the drug molecules are dissolved or dispersed. Typical degradable polymers that are used for NPs are poly(D,L- lactide), poly(D,L-glycolide), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), polyanhydride, and poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate), among others [5, 20–22]. 2.5 Nanogels A nanogel is a nanosized hydrogel made of physically or chemically cross- linked polymers that are water-soluble. A nanogel that is composed of respon- sive polymers may change volume depending on the external environment [23]. Vinogradov et al. prepared a poly(ethylene glycol)-cl-polyethyleneimine nanogel using a modified emulsification-solvent evaporation method. The size distribution of the nanogels ranged between 40 and 300 nm. The nanogels formed complexes with negatively charged oligonucleotides, which enhanced the uptake of oligonucleotides by cells in culture [24]. Bae recently reported a virus-mimetic (VM) nanogel that consisted of a hydrophobic core composed of poly(histidine-co-phenylalanine)(poly(His- co-Phe)) and two layers of hydrophilic shells [PEG and bovine serum albumin (BSA)] (Fig. 3) [25]. The PEG is linked to the core-forming block and to BSA, which forms a capsid-like outer shell through an oil-in-water emulsion method. At high pHs, the core of this nanogel is hydrophobic and becomes rigid; the core swells, however, due to hydrophilicity from the ionization of polyHis at low pHs. As a result, when the nanogels were exposed to an early endosomal pH of 6.4, the gel grew from 55 nm to 355 nm. This pH-dependent size change between pH 7.4 and 6.4 was reversible (Fig. 3) and was closely linked to the release rate of incorporated doxorubicin (DOX). The nanogels released a significant amount of DOX at endosomal pHs (\u00026.4) while reducing the DOX release rate at cytosolic or extracellular pHs (e.g., pH 6.8–7.4). Furthermore, nanogels can disrupt the endosomal membrane through the proton-buffering effect of polyHis and the observed nanogel volume expansion within cell endosomes. This allows VM nanogels and the anticancer drug (that is released from the nanogels) to transfer from the endosomes to the cytosol, where the VM nanogels rapidly shrink to their original size as a result of the more neutral local pH, and thereby reduce the drug release rate. Release of the drug as triggered by endosomal pH would be in the cytosol. The drug would then diffuse into the nucleus, which is the pharmacological target site. The 210 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae drug’s action on the cells would induce apoptosis, which in turn would release the nanogels for subsequent infection and activity in neighboring cells. This infectious cycle has been demonstrated in cultures of drug-resistant tumor cells and is thought to have a high potential for maximizing drug efficacy in treating tumors, inflamed tissues, and other diseases due to sequential cytotoxic action. 2.6 Polymersomes Polymersomes are self-assembled polymeric vesicles, analogs of liposomes, that are formed from a diverse array of synthetic amphiphilic block copolymers [26, 27]. Their advantages over liposomes are improved stability in storage [28–30] and prolonged circulation time [31]. While the hydrophilic aqueous core accom- modates water-soluble drugs, the thick hydrophobic wall membrane of the polymersome provides room for hydrophobic drugs [32]. In addition, multi- functional polymersomes can be designed from functional block copolymers [8]. Most polymersomes contain poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a hydrophilic outer shell, providing a stealth-like character to the drug, which increases circulation times and biocompatibility [28]. Polymersomes offer advantages for clinical therapeutic and diagnostic imaging applications. The ratio of the hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic volume fraction is the key in determining the mesoscopic formulations among micelles (spherical, prolate, or oblate) or vesicles (polymersomes) in aqueous solution [33–35]. In general, a proportion of hydrophilic block-to-total polymer from 25 to 45% favors polymersome formation, while block copolymers that have proportions greater than 45% favors micelle formation [36]. Fig. 3 Schematic picture of pH-sensitive, virus-mimetic (VM) nanogel and its in vitro swel- ling/deswelling property by particle size results between pH 7.4 and 6.5 (adapted from Ref. [25] with permission) Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 211 Hydrophobic blocks that are used for polymersome fabrication are inert polyethylethylene, polybutadiene, polystyrene, polydimethylsiloxane, degrad- able poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL). Hydrophilic blocks include negatively charged poly(acrylic acid) and cross-linkable poly- methyloxazoline. Neutral PEG is more common for bioapplications. Among block copolymers, PEO–PLA and PEO–PCL are becoming widely adopted [26]. 2.7 Depot Systems Depot systems are usually formulated as implants. Their application focuses on either limiting high drug concentrations to the immediate area that surrounds the pathologic site or providing patients with sustained drug release for systemic therapy [37, 38]. Clinical implant systems have been used in hormone replace- ment therapy and in the treatment of prostate cancer [39]. The implants can be formulated into highly viscous liquids or semisolids [40, 41]. Degradable poly- meric materials are used as implants, including polysaccharides, poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and nonbiodegradable methacrylates [42, 40, 37]. Biodegradable polymers are more favorable because they do not need to be surgically removed later. Implants with anticancer agents confine potentially toxic anticancer drugs within tumors with sustained drug release. A viscous gelatin solution or a galactoxyloglucan gel of mitomycin C that is administered intraperitoneally has been used [40]. A 5-fluorouracil poly(ortho ester) implant increased the benefit of the drug, although the high dose of the drug was associated with related toxicity [43]. Biodegradable copolymers of PLA, poly(mandelic acid), and poly(hydroxyphenylacetic acid) provided therapeutic anticancer drug levels for 10 weeks [44]. Low-molecular-weight biodegradable ABA- or BAB-type triblock copoly- mers have been investigated as thermogelling depots [45–47], where A is PEG and B is PLGA. Their aqueous polymer solutions have reverse gelation proper- ties, enabling them to be soluble in water at or below room temperature or allowing them to become hydrogels at the injection site. Such depots slowly degrade over 4–6 weeks [48]. The copolymers can solubilize poorly soluble paclitaxel (PTX), can stabilize liable protein drugs, and can provide a sustained release of drugs for 1–6 weeks [49]. 3 Solubility An intrinsic challenge for most anticancer drugs in clinical applications is low solubility in water [50]. This is one of the major issues in drug formulations. For intracellular delivery, a drug molecule must have a certain degree of hydro- phobicity, enabling it to cross the cell membrane [51, 52]. The binding affinity to target cells is often associated with the lipophilicity of the drug molecules. Consequently, most potent drug candidates often present poor water solubility, 212 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae which leads to poor absorption and bioavailability [53] and causes aggregation on intravenous administration and embolization in the blood vessels [50]. The aggregates can induce side effects as severe as respiratory system failure, can increase local toxicity, and can lower systemic bioavailability because of high local concentrations at the sites of deposition [54]. A large fraction (40%) of potential drug candidates fail to enter formulation development due to problems with solubility [55]. Conventional approaches to increase solubility include using excipients such as ethanol and other organic solvents, Cremophor EL (polyethoxylated castor oil), and surfactants [54]. Applying salts or adjusting pH can increase the aqueous solubility if drug molecules contain ionizable groups [56]. Reprecipitation on dilution of the solubilized drug with aqueous solutions (such as physiological fluids by par- enteral administration) should be addressed. The toxicity and side effects of cosolvents or surfactants are also problems in formulations [57]. Drug carriers, such as nanoparticles [58], conjugates [3], and micelles [6], have shown promising results with significantly improved solubi- lity. Their capacity to solubilize varies, depending on the incorporated drugs. For example, PTX can be incorporated into PEO–PLA micelles. The solubility of PTX can be up to 50 mg/mL [59], while the solubility of PTX in water has been shown to be as low as 0.5 mg/mL [60]. In addition, the aqueous solubility of PTX that was conjugated to PEG and a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendri- mer increased dramatically to 2.5 mg/mL and 3.2 mg/mL, respectively [61]. 4 Biodistribution With intravenous administration, conventional low-molecular-weight antican- cer drugs are distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream and affect both malignant and normal cells. The goal of chemotherapy is to concentrate a drug to the target site as much as possible and to minimize side effects. 4.1 Long Circulation To increase the residence time of drug carriers in the blood, the carriers are modified with hydrophilic synthetic polymers, such as PEG [62–64]. Coating nanoparticles with PEG sterically disrupts the interactions of blood compo- nents with the carrier surface and subsequently decreases the binding of plasma proteins. This minimizes opsonin adsorption onto the carrier and carrier uptake rates by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [65–67]. Repulsive interactions [68] and poor permeability of proteins through PEG coating [69] may contri- bute to this observation. The following are various appealing properties of PEG as a protecting polymer: excellent solubility in aqueous solutions, high flexibility of its polymer chain, low toxicity, low immunogenicity, low antigenicity, lack of accumulation in the RES, and minimal influence on specific biological properties of modified Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 213 pharmaceuticals [70–72]. PEG does not create any toxic metabolites because PEG is not biodegradable. PEG molecules that have a molecular weight below 40 kDa are readily excreted from the body through the kidneys [73]. Currently, there exist many chemical approaches to synthesize activated derivatives of PEG and to conjugate these derivatives to a variety of drugs and drug carriers [70–74]. Other polymers have been used as alternatives to PEG [75]. They must have biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and a highly flexible main chain. Examples are single-end, lipid-modified poly(acryl amide), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) [66, 76], poly(acryloyl morpholine), [77] phospholipid-modified poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) or poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), [78] phosphatidyl polyglycerols [79], and polyvinyl alcohol [80]. Surface modification of poly- meric carriers can be carried out by physical adsorption of a protecting polymer on the carrier surface or by chemical grafting of polymer chains onto the carriers. The concentration of DOX in plasma after injection of free DOX in animal models ranges from several micrograms per milliliter to \u000220 mg/mL after 5–10 min at a dose of 10 mg/kg [81–83]. One study reported a DOX half-life of 26 min [81]. As compared with the values of free DOX, DOX that was carried by PEG–po- ly[Asp(ADR)] micelles demonstrated a high initial concentration in the blood (and plasma), with a long half-life of 70 min. This result indicates that the PEG chains in the outer shell play a crucial role in the extended circulation of PEG–P[Asp(ADR)] micelles in the blood and promote less absorption of DOX-loaded micelles into living tissues and less metabolic activity by the tissues than free DOX [84]. 4.2 Distribution Volume The process of drug deposition depends on the distribution volume. When a drug is associated with a carrier, the rate of drug clearance is decreased (the half-life increases), and the volume of distribution is decreased. Consequently, it pro- motes tumor uptake [85]. The size of the carrier (normally 5–200 nm) minimizes penetration of the drugs into the organs and renal clearance. The volume dis- tribution of the carrier is similar to the plasma volume when the blood circulation of the drug carrier is increased and the drug release rate from the carriers is slow [2]. Therefore, this limited distribution volume increases the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as in the case of HPMA copolymer-linked doxorubicin [86]. 4.3 Toxicity Profile Ideal chemotherapeutics should target only tumor cells and should decrease tumor burden by inducing cytostatic or cytotoxic effects. Their lack of specifi- city, however, allows most chemotherapeutic drugs to have an adverse effect on normal cells and organs, leading to various side effects, including nephrotoxi- city, hematotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and impairment of other functions [87–89]. 214 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae In vitro toxicology using cell cultures has been used as an alternative method for early toxicity in in vivo tests. Alteration of cultured cell lines, however, compared with their tissues of origin, as well as the contrasting sensitivities of these cells and original normal tissues to chemical agents, has revealed a discre- pancy in toxicity profiles between in vitro cell cultures and in vivo animal studies. Several studies have reported that human primary cells are good models for toxicity analysis and provide a promising alternative to animal models [90–92]. Nephrotoxicity is a major side effect of chemotherapy. Evaluating renal toxicity from anticancer drugs uses renal slices and isolated cell suspensions of renal proximal tubules [93]. Cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (CDDP), is an inorganic platinum anticancer agent that offers broad-spectrum antitumor activity against various types of animal and human tumors [94]. CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity is the most important dose-limiting factor in chemotherapy [87, 95]. Earlier studies have reported that CDDP therapy is related to cardiotoxicity [89]. In one study, polymeric micelles that incorporated CDDP were prepared as a polymer–metal complex between CDDP and poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(glutamic acid) block copolymers. Four of 10 mice that were treated with CDDP micelles (4 mg/kg; five doses at 2-day intervals) showed complete tumor regression with no significant body weight loss, whereas free CDDP treatment at the same drug dose and regimen resulted in tumor survival and 20% body weight loss. It appears that CDDP-incorporated micelles are less toxicthanfreeCDDP, in addition to its improved therapeutic efficacy [96, 97]. 4.4 EPR Effect Recent studies have reported that polymer–drug conjugates and nanoparticulates experience prolonged circulation in the blood and more passive accumulation in tumors, even in the absence of targeting moieties [10], suggesting the existence of a passive retention mechanism. Tumor blood vessels have abnormal qualities, such as a high proportion of proliferating endothelial cells, open pores, increased tortuosity, pericyte deficiency, and aberrant basement membrane formation. This defective vascular structure is due to rapid vascularization, providing tumor cells with oxygen and nutrients for rapid growth and rendering the vessels permeable to macromolecules and nanoparticles. Decreased lymphatic drainage keeps the carriers in the tumor. This passive targeting mechanism has been called the ‘‘enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect’’ and was first identified by Maeda et al. [98, 99]. Numerous studies have shown that the EPR effect results in passive accumulation of macromole- cules and nanosized particulates (e.g., polymer conjugates, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, and liposomes) in solid tumor tissues, increasing the therapeutic index while decreasing side effects. Figure 4 describes the concept of passive tumor targeting by EPR effects. Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 215 Although the optimal size of nanoparticles that accumulate in a tumor by the EPR effect is unknown, studies that have used liposomes and nanoparticles have reported that the cutoff size of the pores in tumor vessels is 200 nm–1.2 mm [84]. A tumor-dependent pore cutoff size of 200 nm–2 mm was proven by direct observation of tumor vasculature [100, 101]. These results suggest that drug- loaded nanosized carriers accumulate in malignant tumor cells [102]. DOX-incorporating polymer-based nanoparticles circulate in the blood for more than 3 days and gradually accumulate in tumors via the EPR effect [103]. Although a wide variety of polymer-based drug carriers may be used for tumor targeting of anticancer drugs via the EPR effect, it should be noted that vessel permeability, which forms a cornerstone of the EPR effect, varies during tumor progression. In addition, extravasation of polymeric carriers depends on tumor type and anatomical location, as well as the physicochemical properties of the utilized polymer [104]. 5 Triggered Release Despite various advantages of nanosized drug carriers, such as extended circu- lation [62], passive accumulation in solid tumors [103], improved stability [104], tumor targeting via conjugation to a specific ligand [105], and biodegradability in vivo [106], the kinetics of release of an incorporated drug is another critical factor in determining the success of the design and development of carriers. If the drug releases prematurely in the blood during a lengthy circulation, it may cause systemic side effects and fail to meet the sufficient therapeutic window of drug concentration at acting sites, while the delay of drug release in tumors could contribute to the development of MDR in tumor cells [107]. Recently, there have been various attempts to develop responsive systems for release to specific signals. For example, thermoresponsive polymeric carriers that respond to hyperthermic conditions [108] and pH-sensitive systems that activate in tumor-acidic pHs [109] have been investigated.

Kim and Y.H. Bae 5.1 pH-Responsive Delivery The use of acidic pH has been a common strategy for the development of various pH-sensitive systems for modulated drug delivery. In particular, most extracellular pHs (pHe) of solid tumors are more acidic (pH, 6.5–7.2) than normal tissues [110, 111]. A major cause of acidic tumor pH is the high rate of glycolysis in tumor cells under aerobic or anaerobic conditions [99, 112]. The acidic environment may benefit tumor invasion (metastasis) by disturbing the extracellular matrix of the surrounding normal tissues [113] Thus, triggering drug release at this tumor pHe may induce localized high-dose therapy that is effective for tumor treatment. Another distinct acidic pH is found in subcellular organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes. Two major design approaches have been implemented in designing pH- responsive release systems: the use of degradable chemical bonds between drugs and carriers [114, 115] that are cleaved by acidic endolysosomal pH (<6.5) [116] and structural destabilization of self-assembled carriers [117–120]. An example of pH-induced chain cleavage in drug delivery applications is the acetal bond. 5-Fluorouridine release from 5-fluorour- idine–PEG conjugate was shown to be due to the pH-sensitive acetal bond, which is cleaved at pH 5.0 through hydrolysis with minimal release at pH 7.4 [121]. pH-sensitive micelles composed of polymer–DOX conjugates via a hydra- zone bond also have been investigated. In one study, DOX was conjugated to PEG/polyaspartate-folate, and the conjugate block copolymers formed a micelle. The micelles were assessed for endosomal pH sensitivity. They were stable during blood circulation with minimal drug leakage, successfully accu- mulated in solid tumors, and internalized into cancer cells by folate receptor- mediated endocytosis, followed by DOX release after endosomal pH (pH<6.5)- induced cleavage of the hydrazone linkage [122]. Acidic pH can also change the structure of the polymeric carrier, resulting in drug release from the destabilized carriers. One example is tumor extracellular pH (pHe)- sensitive polymeric micelles that are composed of poly(L-histidine) (polyHis) (Mw 5000)/PEG (Mw 2000) diblock copolymers [117, 118, 120]. These micelles are stable at pH 7.4 but unstable at pHe. They are associated with the ability of polyHis to switch by protonation below pKb. Unprotonated polyHis above its pKb becomes hydrophobic. Protonation below pKb renders polyHis hydrophilic due to the ioniza- tion of its imidazole ring, resulting in gradual disintegration of the micelle into monomers. In one study, polyHis/PEG micelles were prepared at pH 8.0 via dialysis. DOX-encapsulated polyHis/PEG micelles, however, showed relative instability at pH 7.4. To overcome this limitation, a mixed micelle system composed of polyHis/PEG (75 wt%) and PLLA/PEG-folate (25 wt%) was prepared. The incorporation of a nonionizable block copolymer (PLLA/PEG) in the micellar structure of polyHis/PEG endowed it with improved stability at pH 7.4 due to Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 217 increased hydrophobicity of the micelle core. The pH-sensitive mixed micelles (PHSMs) started to disintegrate below pH 7.0. The results from in vivo tests that have used DOX-loaded PHSMs (equiva- lent DOX=10 mg/kg) showed significant inhibition (P<0.05 compared with free DOX or saline solution) of the growth of subcutaneous s.c. MCF-7 xeno- grafts, as presented in Fig. 5. The tumor volume of mice that were treated with PHSMs (P<0.05 compared with free DOX) was 4.5 or 3.6 times smaller than those compared with saline solution or free DOX treatment after 6 weeks. The combination of the EPR effect and triggered release of DOX by tumor pHe may be synergistic in tumor chemotherapy, leading to higher local con- centrations of the drug at tumor sites (targeted high-dose tumor therapy) with a minimal release of the drug from the micelles during circulation in the blood (pH 7.4). The volume of tumors that were treated with PHSMs was 3.0 times smaller than that of tumors that were treated with ordinary, pH-insensitive micelles (Fig. 5A). Stable body weight in the experimental groups, except for free DOX, indicated a minimum toxicity of the micellar systems (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5 Tumor growth inhibition of s.c. human breast MCF-7 carcinoma xenografts in BALB/c nude mice. Mice were injected i.v. with 10 mg/kg DOX equivalent dose: DOX- loaded PHSM (E), PHSM/f (~), PHIM (r), PHIM/f (^), and DOX (\u0003). Two i.v. injections on days 0 and 3 were made. (a) Tumor volume change and (b) body weight change (n ¼ 5). Values are the means of the standard deviations (SD) (adapted from Ref. [120] with permission) 218 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae For PTX delivery, the micellar system of a pH-sensitive diblock copolymer was investigated. The block copolymer consisted of a hydrophilic block of 2-(metha- cryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and a pH-sensitive hydrophobic block of 2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DPA) [123]. The results showed com- plete PTX release after 20 hours at pH 5.0 and 70% of the initial PTX release after 50 hours at pH 7.4. 5.2 Temperature-Responsive Delivery The principal mechanism of temperature-sensitive polymers is the sharp transition from coil to globule in water on heating, indicating a change from a hydrophilic state (coil) below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) to a hydrophobic state (globule) above the LCST. Representative temperature-sensi- tive polymers include N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm), its copolymers (LCST: 30–508C) [108, 124–127], polyester block copolymers (20–1008C) [97, 128], and elastin-like polypeptides (27–408C) [129–131]. To achieve both spatial and tem- poral control in conjunction with local temperature increases (2–58C), the LCST of a given polymer can be tailored through its comonomer composition, hydro- philic–hydrophobic balance, stereochemistry [125–127, 132], and the addition of salts and surfactants [133]. These thermosensitive polymers with controlled LCSTs (around body temperature) can be applied to specific applications (e.g., tumor treatment). An example is the fabrication of micelles that are composed of inert hydro- phobic cores with an outer shell of polyNIPAAm, which have shown phase transitions that are slightly above 328C [125]. This change in the outer shell above the LCST from hydrophilic to hydrophobic results in micelle aggrega- tion, self-reorganization, accelerated drug release, and enhanced interactions with cells. The hydrophobic blocks that are used to form the core of PNI- PAAm-based micelles are: methacrylic acid stearoyl ester (MASE), stearoyl chloride (SC) [126], poly(N-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) [125, 126, 134], poly- styrene (PS) [124], and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) [135, 136]. Drug release from polyNIPAAm/PBMA micelles shows temperature depen- dence. The initial drug was released up to 10% below 378Cand acceleratedupto 90% at 378C [127]. This change was caused by structural deformation of PNI- PAAm/PBMA micelles on heating. Interestingly, similar behaviors have been shown in studies using poly(NIPAAm-co-N,N-dimethylacrylamide)/PLGA block copolymers (LCST 39.18C) [135, 136]. The drug-loaded micelles, with an average size below 200 nm, were stable at 378C, while the micelles became deformed and induced triggered drug release at 39.58C (above normal body temperature). In vitro cytotoxicity studies with drug-loaded micelles have also shown greater cytotoxicity above the LCST, resulting from thermally induced drug release. These results suggest that combination therapy can be implemented, using both thermosensitive systems and local hyperthermic treatment of tumors, primarily at 428C. The coupled treatment may prove to be more Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 219 effective as a result of passive drug accumulation in tumors by the EPR effect [99] and increased tumoral drug concentration by externally modulated hyperthermic conditions. Despite successful results from in vitro studies, however, the clinical applica- tions of systems that are based on polyNIPAAm may be limited, because poly- NIPAAm is nondegradable and insoluble. In addition, a major problem of polyNIPAAm-based drug delivery systems is that thermal treatment is required for controlled destabilization of the micelles and concurrent drug release, which is not always feasible in clinical situations. Therefore, to overcome the disadvan- tages of polyNIPAAm, controlled biodegradable systems that use polyester block copolymers as thermosensitive polymers have been investigated. Biodegradable and temperature-sensitive nanoparticles from alternating multiblock copolymers (PLLA/PEG/PLLA) were synthesized by coupling dicarboxylated PEG (Mw 2000) with PLLA [128]. The antitumor drug DOX was incorporated into the nanoparticles through dialysis. The results from in vitro studies that used Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells indicated that DOX- loaded micelles showed more cytotoxicity against LLC cells at 428C than at 378C. The treatment of tumors using this nanoparticle is induced from a synergistic effect, such as combined biodegradation and thermal sensitivity at 428C when coupled with local hypothermia. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) that have a pentapeptide (Val-Pro-Gly-Val- Gly) repeat have a similar LCST to PNIPAAm and also have hydrophobic folding and assembly transitions at \u0002408C [130, 137]. The hydrophobicity of ELPs can determine their LCST and is dependent on the fourth amino acid. For example, substituting Ala or Gly with Val in the fourth position of the ELP sequence increases the LCST of ELP from 278Cto408C [138]. ELP accumulates in solid tumors on heating to 428C, as compared with tumors that are heated to 348C [139]. In addition, ELPs that are conjugated with DOX using a pH- sensitive hydrazone bond [140] increase cellular DOX uptake two- to threefold in hyperthermal tumor cells over control cells [141]. Based on these results, ELP–drug conjugates are a promising carrier for tumor targeting under hyperthermic conditions [142]. Upcoming clinical trials will determine the antitumoral efficacy of thermal-sensitive systems that are based on ELP as well as systems that are based on polyesters or PNIPAAm. 5.3 Ultrasound-Responsive Drug Delivery Ultrasonography has various advantages for drug delivery because its nonin- vasive energy through the skin can be limited to specific locations and can trigger drug release at that site. Liposome formulation for anticancer drugs initially was studied using ultrasonography [143, 144]. Ultrasonography gen- erates thermal energy to cause hyperthermic conditions, as described previously. 220 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae A recent and novel application of ultrasonography in drug delivery showed the ability to produce cavitation activity, a process by which gas bubbles are created and oscillate in the membrane [145, 146]. There are two major mechan- isms in ultrasound-triggered drug release [147]. The first contribution is the disruption of drug carriers. Drug-loaded vesicles (or micelles) that are denser than the surrounding liquid will be ruptured and will release their contents if the shear stress (e.g., strength from ultrasonography) exceeds the strength of the drug carrier. The second mechanism is promoted by the low frequency of high-intensity ultrasonography, resulting in collapse cavitation. When drugs are bound to a poly- meric carrier, the backbone of the polymers can be pulled apart by viscous shear stresses that are generated from collapse cavitation, and the drug may be released from the polymer backbone. Other mechanisms have also been discussed [147]. Ultrasound-activated drug release using Pluronic (PEG/poly(propylene oxide) (PPO)/PEG) micelle solutions has been studied by Rapoport and Pitt [148–151]. Marin et al. proposed two mechanisms that control acoustic activation of drug release and uptake from Pluronic micelles [152, 153]. The first mechanism indicated that acoustically triggered micelles release the drug, leading to higher concentra- tions of free drug in the medium. The other mechanism involves uptake of micelle- encapsulated drugs into cells based on the perturbation of cell membranes by ultrasonography. Both mechanisms were noted to function cooperatively. Recently, several in vivo studies have supported acoustically activated drug delivery [148, 149]. Nelson et al. [151] showed that applying low-frequency ultrasonography (20 and 70 kHz) significantly reduced tumor size when com- pared with noninsonated controls in rats using encapsulated DOX in Pluronic micelles. Gao et al. evaluated the effects of ultrasonography on drug targeting and release using Pluronic P-105 micelles [148, 149]. They stabilized micelles using PEG–diacylphospholipid and tested DOX-loaded micelles.Micelles accumulated in the tumor effected reduced tumor growth using local ultrasonic irradiation (1 or 3 MHz for 30 seconds) at the tumor site in ovarian tumor-bearing mice. 5.4 Enzyme-Responsive Delivery Over the past few decades, enzyme-triggered drug release has been attractive because it uses linkers or bonds that are cleavable by certain enzymes. These carriers reach the target area by the EPR effect and by active targeting. The destabilization of carriers due to the enzymes at the target site induces drug release from carriers that contain enzyme-sensitive linkers. The primary advan- tage of this system is that carrier destabilization and consequent drug release can be controlled by modifying the cleavable bonds or linkers to be specific to enzymes that are present at the target sites. Various PEG–DOX conjugates have been formed micelles in aqueous solu- tion and prepared using different peptide linkers (GFLG, GLFG, GLG, GGRR, and RGLG) for covalent attachment of DOX to the carriers. Their particle sizes have ranged from 13 to 46 nm [154]. PEGs of linear or branched Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 221 architecture (MW 5000–20000) have been used. The release of DOX in vitro indicated that the micelle was destabilized by linker degradation from lysoso- mal enzymes, triggering drug release. Oishi et al. prepared polyion complex (PIC) micelles to deliver antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (asODN) to cells. They were formed by conjugating PEG with ODN using a disulfide linkage (PEG-SS-asODN) and assembling them into branched poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) [155]. Cleavage of the disulfide linkage induced release of the active asODN molecules into the cellular interior, leading to a high glutathione concentration in the cytoplasm. Recently, biodegradable and disassembled dendritic molecules have been introduced for anticancer drug delivery. Several anticancer prodrugs have been developed to be activated selectively in malignant tissues by a specific enzyme, which is targeted [156] or secreted [157] near the tumor cells. The release of the free drug occurs through cleavage of a prodrug from a protecting group. Recently, a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer–succinic acid–PXT con- jugate was prepared with a hydrolysable ester bond that is cleaved by esterase- hydrolyzing enzyme [61]. The conjugate formulation showed 10-fold higher in vitro cytotoxicity than did the unconjugated drug. Self-immolative dendrimers have been developed as a novel prodrug plat- form [158, 159]. These dendrimers have a unique structure that can release all of their tail units through self-immolative chain fragmentation, which is initiated by a single cleavage event at the dendrimer core. The drug is incorporated into the tail units, and a multiprodrug unit is released from the dendrimers by a single enzymatic cleavage. One study focused on a heterotrimeric system with the anticancer drugs camptothecin (CPT), DOX, and etoposide using retroaldol, a retro-Michael trigger that is activated by antibody 38C2 [158]. In vitro studies using cell growth inhibition assays reported that cell growth was inhibited 15-fold when using the heterotrimeric prodrug over the control group due to activation by antibody 38C2. In a recent study, a series of dendritic prodrugs with four molecules, including the anticancer agent CPT, have been studied. A drug has also been shown to be released by penicillin-G-amidase activation under phy- siological conditions [160]. Cell growth inhibition results showed increased toxicity of the dendritic prodrug on incubation with the enzyme. 6 Cytosolic Delivery 6.1 Active Targeting Research has focused on developing a drug delivery system that uses active targeting, because cancer cells often overexpress surface (glyco)proteins (tumor- associated antigens or tumor-specific antigens) that may be found at low levels on normal cells. The chemical attachment of a targeting moiety on drug carriers induces cellular uptake of the drug carriers and drug by active endocytosis. 222 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are most often used for active targeting [161]. Drug carriers are conjugated with a whole mAb or binding fragments of an mAb for active intracellular delivery of anticancer drugs. There are reviews on mAb-based active targeting [161–163], but the stability and eco- nomic issues of mAbs, however, should not be ignored. Folic acid is one member of the vitamin B family. Folate receptor targeting presents several advantages over antigen targeting. Folic acid is a simple, low- molecular-weight compound, and it is stable and economic. Folate conjugates offer flexible conjugation chemistry. As a result, its conjugates have been used to deliver a variety of drugs and imaging agents [164–166]. In addition, various tumors of colon, lung, prostate, ovaries, mammary glands, and brain over- express folate receptor (FR) [167–170]. Folate-conjugated drugs [162] or folate-conjugated nanoparticles [171] use receptor-mediated endocytosis for cellular internalization and can bypass can- cer cell drug efflux pumps and overcome MDR [172]. The receptor-mediated uptake of folate conjugates proceeds through distinct steps (Fig. 6). The folate conjugates initiate by binding to FRs on the cell surface. After invagination of Endosome Folate Folate receptor Fig. 6 The chemical structure of folic acid and the series of distinct steps of the folate receptor- mediated endocytosis (adapted from Ref. [187] with permission) Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 223 the plasma membrane, they form unique endocytic vesicles (endosomes). The acidic pH in endosomes enables FR–carrier complexes to disassemble FR from the complexes. The disassembled and membrane-bound FRs are directed back to the cell surface to mediate the delivery of additional folate conjugates. Concurrently, the folate conjugates that are released from FRs escape the endosome if there is any endosomal membrane disruption [173], resulting in drug deposition in the cytoplasm. To date, a number of conjugates (including protein toxins [174], immune stimulants, chemotherapeutic agents, liposomes, nanoparticles, and imaging agents) have been developed with folic acid and have been delivered to FR-expressing cells [175]. Transferrin, an 80-kDa glycoprotein, is also an appropriate ligand for tumor targeting because its receptors are overexpressed on cancer cells [176, 177]. In biological terms, the liver synthesizes transferrin, which is secreted into the plasma. In blood, transferrin binds to endogenous iron, forming the iron– transferrin chelate, which is an important physiological source of iron for cells in the body. Transferrin receptors on cell surfaces recognize the chelate and mediate its endocytosis into acidic compartments. Sahoo and Labhasetwar [178] prepared PXT-loaded PLGA nanoparticles, wherein transferrin was conjugated to them via epoxy linkages. There in vitro results using transfer- rin-conjugated nanoparticles showed greater cellular uptake and reduced exo- cytosis, leading to greater antiproliferative activity and more sustained effects compared with the free drug or unconjugated nanoparticles. Another example of targeting moieties includes luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). The surfaces of healthy human cells have little LHRH receptor, while it is overexpressed on ovarian and other cancer cells [179]. Recently, an LHRH–PEG–camptothecin conjugate was developed as a targeted anticancer drug delivery system [180]. The validity of LHRH receptor targeting was evidenced by higher cytotoxicity against cancer cells using the targeted conjugate compared with the nontargeted PEG–camptothecin conjugate or the free drug in vivo. Other active targeting systems include specific peptides to target cells and organs that are selected from a phase display method [181–182] and aptamers, which are short molecules of double-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA that bind to specific molecular targets [183]. 6.2 Endosomolysis Drug carriers localize to acidic endosomes (pH 5.0–6.5) after internalization into cells via an endocytic process and can reach the lysosome, where they face harsh conditions, such as extreme lower pHs and enzymatic degradation. Therefore, therapeutic agents should be released from the endosomes into the cytoplasm before reaching the lysosomes to avoid degradation and inactiva- tion. Drug carriers circumvent these challenges by facilitating drug transport into the cytoplasm, which leads to increased bioavailability in the cytosol and 224 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae nucleus [184]. Several systems have been proposed, including supplementation of fusogenic peptides [185] and the use of polymers that have intrinsic abilities to escape endosomolysis [186–188]. Another approach is the use of cell- penetrating peptides (CPPs) to facilitate uptake of various molecules. Fusogenic peptides of natural (e.g., N-terminus of hemagglutinin subunit HA-2 of influenza virus) or synthetic [e.g., WEAALAEALAEALAEHLAEA- LAEALEALAA (GALA) or WEAKLAKALAKALAKHLAKALAKALK- ACEA (KALA)] origin have been applied to the endo- and lysosomal escape of several drug delivery systems [185]. The conformational transition of peptides by pH enables them to interact with the phospholipid membranes, resulting in pore formation, membrane fusion, or lysis. As a consequence, incorporation of synthetic membrane-active peptides into delivery systems can enhance intracel- lular delivery of drugs. The efficiency and the cost, however, prevent the use of synthetic peptides to enhance cellular delivery of various compounds. Endolysosomal escape has also been demonstrated by various endosomoly- tic polymers [186–188] using the ‘‘proton sponge hypothesis,’’ which is based on osmotic swelling of the vesicle via buffering of the endosomal environment. Under these conditions, the endosomal membrane will rupture, leading to the release of drugs into the cytoplasm. pH-sensitive micelles (PHSMs) that are composed of poly(L-histidine)/PEG and PLLA/PEG are strong candidates for cytoplasmic drug delivery by active intracellular translocation of the drug carriers via specific interactions com- bined with triggered release at endosomal pH (pH<6.5). Micelles have been conjugated with folic acid (PHSM/f) for folate receptor-mediated tumor target- ing [117]. From the results of an in vitro cell experiment, DOX-loaded PHSM/f showed enhanced cytotoxicity (cell viability \u000216% at DOX 10 mg/mL) at pH 7.4 after folate receptor-mediated endocytosis, while pH-insensitive micelles composed of PLLA/PEG-folate (PHIM/f) exhibited reduced cytotoxicity (cell viability \u000280% at DOX 10 mg/mL) at the same pH. Interestingly, the confocal results using DOX-loaded PHSM/f revealed the widespread presence of drug or micelles in the cytosol and nucleus in MCF-7 cells. PHSM/f is able to deliver a drug into the cytosol efficiently. On the other hand, PLLA/PEG-folate micelles targeted drugs or micelles to endosomes instead of the cytosol [117]. This difference verifies the endosomal escape of the folate-conjugated PHSM, which is underlied by two possible mechanisms. One is the proton-sponge effect of polyHis that is caused by the protonation of imidazole groups at endosomal pH, and the other is the interaction of proto- nated polyHis with the negatively charged phospholipid membrane. Similarly, N-acetyl histidine-conjugated glycol chitosan was used to trigger cytoplasmic drug release [189]. Histidine was conjugated with poly(2-hydro- xyethyl aspartamide) (PHEA) and octadecylamine-grafted PHEA via an ester linkage to induce pH sensitivity. The results showed endosomal destabilization by histidine and endosomal pH-triggered drug release [190]. These observations clarify the role of polyHis in antitumor activity by destabilization in drug release using the pH sensitivity of polyHis and fusogenicity. Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 225 ‘‘Cell-penetrating peptides’’ (CPPs) or ‘‘protein transduction domains’’ (PTDs) were introduced as a novel approach to deliver drug carriers into intracellular compartments. One advantage is that they are able to maintain the bioactivity of the transported drug. Among the most frequently used pep- tides are TAT [191], Antennapedia (Antp) [192], poly-arginine peptides [193], Tp10 [194], a variant of transportan [195], YTA2 [196], and penetratin [197]. Although the mechanism by which they internalize is unclear, the intra- cellular access of the drug is increased. Nevertheless, the mechanism is not determined by the cell type but by the different peptides [198]. Tat-mediated delivery uses energy for macropinocytosis for subsequent escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm, eventually for transport into the nucleus. Other CPPs penetrate cells via electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding [198]. The following is an example of a novel drug-targeting system for cellular internalization using TAT. The delivery system consists of two components: (1) a polymeric micelle that has a hydrophobic core of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and a hydrophilic shell of PEG conjugated to TAT (TAT micelle); (2) an ultra-pH- sensitive diblock copolymer of poly(methacryloyl sulfadimethoxine) (PSD) and PEG (PSD/PEG) [199]. The final carrier system is formulated by complexation of the anionic PSD with the cationic TAT of the micelles. The complex formulation and TAT peptide can be systemically shielded. However, TAT is exposed to slightly acidic tumor pH levels due to disassembly of the complexed micelle. Figure 7 describes the TAT-complexed micelle. In one study, TAT micelles had particle sizes between 20 and 45 nm, and their critical micellar concentra- tions were 3.5 mg/L–5.5 mg/L. The complex formulation showed increased particle size at pH 8.0 compared with the particle size at pH 6.8, indicating complex formation. pH sensitivity of PSD–PEG induced this difference on mixing with TAT micelles. At low pHs (pH 6.6–6.0), the particle sizes showed bimodal distribution, one indicating normal TAT micelles (45 nm) and the other forming from the aggregation of hydrophobic PSD-b-PEG. Zeta poten- tial results confirmed the shielding/deshielding process. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy demonstrated higher uptake of TAT micelles at pH 6.6 compared with pH 7.4, explaining the shielding of TAT peptides at physiolo- gical pH due to complexation of the micelle and deshielding at tumoral pH due to disassembly. Interestingly, flow cytometry demonstrated that TAT peptide was detected on the surface of the nucleus, indicating that the TAT peptide facilitates micelle transport to near the nucleus. These results indicate that TAT-containing drug-loaded micelles target hydrophobic drugs to the nucleus. 7 Multidrug Resistance The resistance of tumor cells to multiple structurally unrelated chemotherapeu- tic drugs has been termed as multidrug resistance (MDR) [200]. Clinical resis- tance of certain tumors to cytotoxic agents has been observed in early 226 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae chemotherapy or after exposure to drugs. The degree of resistance depends on the type of tumor and the history of chemotherapy [201]. In the past, various mechanisms of MDR, as described in Fig. 8, have been studied, such as the expression of multidrug efflux pumps (P-glycoprotein (Pgp) Fig. 7 Schematic model for the proposed drug delivery system consists of two components, a PLLA-b-PEG micelle conjugated to TAT and a pH-sensitive diblock polymer PSD-b-PEG. (a) At normal blood pH, the sulfonamide is negatively charged, and when mixed with the TAT micelle, it shields the TAT by electrostatic interaction. Only PEG is exposed to the outside, which could make the carrier long circulating; (b) when the system experiences a decrease in pH (near tumor), sulfonamide loses charge and detaches, thus exposing TAT for interaction with tumor cells (adapted from Ref. [199] with permission) Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 227 or multidrug resistance-associated proteins) [202–204], altered glutathione metabolism [205], reduced activity of topoisomerase II [206], and various changes in cellular proteins and mechanisms [207–209]. These MDR mechan- isms recognize antitumor drugs and decrease intracellular drug concentration. In addition, acidic intracellular organelles, endosomes, and lysosomes also participate in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [210]. Because most anti- tumor drugs are in an ionizable form, weakly basic drugs accumulate to a greater extent in an acidic phase (such as endosomes and lysosomes). An ionized drug is quarantined due to the impermeability of an ionized drug through cellular or subcellular membranes. Drug extrusion into the external medium (exocytosis) after drug sequestration is another mechanism of MDR for weakly acidic drugs [211, 212]. A combination of an efflux pump, drug sequestration that is induced by a pH gradient, and exocytosis are the most influential factors in MDR. The combination of several mechanisms of drug resistance makes chemotherapy difficult. The development of novel drugs and drug formulations that are effective against drug-resistant cancers is necessary. After identifying Pgp as a major cause of MDR in in vitro cell studies and discovering that verapamil (a blocker) modulates Pgp activity, researchers have devoted a tremendous effort to discovering other Pgp modulators (inhi- bitors) that have high binding affinity to Pgp without other biological activ- ities and also have minimal pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer drugs [213].

Kim and Y.H. Bae Numerous pharmaceutical companies have created Pgp modulators by mod- ifying existing drugs such as verapamil, cyclosporine A, glibenclamide, and others from certain related chemical structures. These research efforts are in various phase I, II, and III clinical studies [214]. No single chemical structure has proven to be effective in phase III studies to date. As mentioned previously, Pgp plays a critical role in experimental MDR, and Pgp modulators block Pgp. MDR in clinical settings is multifaceted, and Pgp inhibition does not seem to be as effective as anticipated [215]. In addition, tumor-specific Pgp modulators have not been reported as yet. Thus, Pgp modulators interact with Pgp in healthy organs, such as placenta, kidney, blood–brain barrier (BBB), liver, and kidney. PK interactions (particularly slow elimination kinetics) seem intrinsic, resulting in greater toxic effects of an anticancer drug. Simply modulating Pgp appears to be an extreme challenge in overcoming MDR in a clinical setting. As an alternative to Pgp modulators alone, various nanosized drug carriers have been tested to circumvent MDR in vitro and in vivo. Carriers include liposomes [216], alkylcyanoacrylate [217], nanoparticles [218], polymeric micelles of Pluronics [219] and other amphiphilic block copo- lymers [220], and PLGA nanoparticles [221]. Pluronic formulations below their CMC with anticancer drugs have been effective in treating MDR tumors [222], whereby these positive results are linked to the functions of Pluronic (PEO/PPO/PEO) block copolymers in crossing the plasma membrane, suppressing ATP production, and to gene modulation. The formulation seems to be effective with MDR tumors but less so with sensitive tumors. This approach lacks tumor specificity, and little is known about its influence on normal cells that express Pgp. On the other hand, Pluronic micelles under ultrasound stimulation have been effective in treating MDR cells [219]. Some nanovehicles carry the drug alone and contain a targeting moiety, while some carry both an anticancer drug and a Pgp modulator [220]. Delivering agents that can silence the Pgp genes, such as siRNA and ODN, which are often carried together with an anticancer drug, have also been examined [223]. Many of these approaches have demonstrated a potential to overcome MDR under certain experimental conditions. However, they primar- ily target a single mechanism of MDR, and no approach has been proven to be effective in clinical MDR tumor treatments. With regard to MDR mechanisms that are linked to microenvironments that allow poor access to drugs, soluble factors, and cell–cell contacts, Au’s group tested a bFGF inhibitor [224] and a method of priming anticancer drugs prior to drug treatment carried by nanosized PLGA particles. This induced partial apoptosis [225] and reduction in tumor tissue size [226]. Improved nanoparticle distribution and MDR reduction were achieved. This approach seems to be promising, although only local administration was used [224–226]. Endosomal pH-sensitive micelles can be internalized into cancer cells that overexpress FR by folate receptor (FR)-mediated endocytosis, such as in Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 229 ovarian and breast tumors. After endocytosis of micelles, simultaneously trig- gered release in early endosomes (\u0002pH 6) and endosomal disruption for drug escape provide high concentrations of the drug in the cytosol and nucleus (potential drug-acting sites) and provide effective anticancer drug delivery, particularly for MDR cells. This approach has been tested by Bae’s group [227] using micelles that are a mixed micellar system that consists of poly(histidine-co-phenylalanine)/PEG and PLLA/PEG-folate. They do not distinguish between sensitive and MDR cells that use various MDR mechanisms, as shown in cytotoxicity tests in vitro. In addition, ovarian cancer MDR xenografts in mice were effectively treated and showed lower toxicity than the control groups that received free DOX treatment or pH-insensitive micelles/DOX treatment. The scheme of these endosomal pH-sensitive micelles is described in Fig. 9. This unique cancer nanotechnology, based on pH-sensitive micelles, boasts four important features for chemotherapy treatment: (1) it is equally cytotoxic to wild-type and MDR cancer cells; (2) it is cytotoxic to MDR cells, regardless of unicellular MDR mechanisms; (3) it is effective in in vivo models; and (4) it Above pH 6, minimal drug release At pH 6 (endosomal pH), destabilization of the micelle and maximal drug release Endosome recycle or exocytosis pH 7.2 pH 7.15 Golgi Bypassing MDRs Below pH 6, Triggered release followed by endosomal disruption Cancer specific receptor- mediated endocytosis MDR cells Fig. 9 The proposed design concept of endosomal pH-sensitive micelles for effective antic- ancer drug delivery to MDR cells with receptor-mediated endocytosis, switching release rate and endosomal escape activity of polymeric micelle components 230 D. Kim and Y.H. Bae causes no apparent polymer cytotoxicity and systemic toxicity in mice. Significant progress in chemotherapy is anticipated by this novel cancer nano- technology using clear mechanisms in treating MDR tumors. This application targets MDR breast and ovarian cancers because of their high expression levels of FR. The technology can be expanded to most tumors by tailoring anticancer drugs and molecular tools for active internalization into cancer cells, potentially becoming a general platform for cancer chemotherapy. 8 Challenges Most studies in this area have highlighted ‘‘cell specificity’’ by discussing short-range interactions between pairs of antigen–mAb, ligand–receptor, aptamer–counterpart, and phase display peptide–counterpart. Specific interactions imply ‘‘target cell- unique expression’’ or ‘‘overexpression’’ when compared with other organs and cells. Quantitative analyses of such specific interactions, however, have been under- reported for active endocytosis in clinical settings. There are issues in these regards, including the fraction of tumor cells from patients that express a specific antigen or receptor, the expression level in each individual cell, the binding affinity between a carrier and a target cell for effective internalization, and the rates of endocytosis and exocytosis. Tumorcells areknown fortheir diversity with regard to cell type, genomics, and proteomics [228]. They are in a dynamic developmental state. Accumulating evidence supports the side population of stem-like cells from cancer cells. They are recognized by different surface markers from the bulk of cancer cells, although cancer stem cells are quiescent under normal conditions. It has been known that the stem-like cells are the underlying cause of MDR and are primarily responsible for metastasis and recurrence. Considering these factors, the extent and the interaction of specific antigens or receptors in active endocytosis of active targeting approaches may be the primary keys in removing tumors and cancer stem cells. In breast cancer patients, less than 30% is diagnosed positive for the Her-2/neu antigen. Immunostaining can indicate the extent of antigen expression. ‘‘Positive’’ is determined by the staining level above a standard (but never 100%) and does not guarantee Herceptin therapy [229]. Recently, the use of Her-2 targeting has been investigated. The investigation of folate receptor expression by immunoas- say on clinical breast tumors has also been challenging [230]. This obstacle has raised the issue of whether results from in vitro or in vivo animal studies using active targeting approaches can be used in clinical settings. Despite various past and current studies, these challenges remain unsolved. One of the most commonly used terms to explain drug targeting is the EPR effect. The porosity and pore size of tumor blood vessels has been amenable to nanocarriers for tumor-targeting therapy, imaging, and diagnosis. The porosity facilitates the supply of adequate nutrients to the developing area in tumors. When tumor growth is inhibited or when the tumor size is decreased by any Polymeric Carriers for Anticancer Drugs 231 therapy, however, does the porosity keep its conformational structure and allow continuous EPR effects with nanocarriers? We hypothesize that the conformational structure of the blood vessel shifts from a wide pore size to a narrow pore size for a normal supply [100]. In this case, what will be the role of nanocarriers? 9 Conclusion Polymeric anticancer drug carriers are versatile drug delivery systems that have tremendous potential for treatment of cancers in humans. Studies to date offer a variety of polymeric carriers that facilitate proper design of highly efficient anticancer drugs. Incorporation of hydrophobic anticancer drugs leads to increased solubility in an aqueous environment. Polymeric carriers also enable delivery of more drugs to cancer sites by extending circulation through steric stabilization, EPR effects from leaky tumor blood vessels, active internaliza- tion, and efficient cytoplasmic drug delivery from environment-responsive properties. Using these advantages, drug efficacy to tumors can be increased, and the side effects on normal cells can be decreased by limiting biodistribution. MDR, one of the major challenges in tumor chemotherapy, may be addressed by carrier design. The heterogeneity of tumor cells and tumor physiology, metastasis of tumor, and cancer stem-like cells restricts research on polymeric carriers. These hurdles still remain as challenges for the development of multifunctional and custom- made polymeric carriers. Nonetheless, the combined findings from polymer chemistry and tumor biology provide researchers with the potential tools to overcome such barriers in the future. References 1.

Jain 1 Introduction Nanotechnology is the creation and utilization of materials, devices, and sys- tems through the control of matter on the nanometer-length scale, i.e., at the level of atoms, molecules, and supramolecular structures. Nanotechnology, as defined by the National Nanotechnology Initiative (http://www.nano.gov/), is the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1–100 nm, where unique phenomena enable novel applications. During the past few years, considerable progress has been made in the application of nanobiotechnology in cancer, i.e. nanooncology, which is currently the most important chapter of nanomedicine [1,2]. Other publications have covered applications of nanobio- technology in diagnostics [3], drug discovery [4], and drug delivery [5]. Several drugs in development for cancer are based on nanotechnology and a few of these are already approved. Nanotechnology-based devices are in development as aids to cancer surgery. Some of the recent development in nanotechnologies and their applications in diagnosing and developing cancer therapies are reviewed in this chapter. The impact of nanobiotechnology on oncology is shown schematically in Fig. 1. 2 Nanotechnology for Detection of Cancer Biomarkers 2.1 Basics of Cancer Biomarkers Any measurable specific molecular alteration of a cancer cell either on DNA, RNA, protein, or metabolite level can be referred to as a cancer biomarker [6]. The expression of a distinct gene can enable its identification in a tissue with none of the surrounding cells expressing the specific biomarker. Cancer cells themselves may be difficult to detect at an early stage but they leave a K.K. Jain (*) Jain PharmaBiotech, Blaesiring 7, CH-4057 Basel, Switzerland e-mail: jain@pharmabiotech.ch Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_8, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 245 fingerprint, i.e., a pattern of change in biomarker proteins that circulate in the blood. There may be 20–25 biomarkers, which may require as many as 500 measurements, all of which should be made from a drop of blood obtained by pinprick. Miniaturized techniques such as nanotechnology are useful for the discovery of cancer biomarkers. Silicon nanowires incorporated into arrays provide label-free, multiplexed electrical detection of cancer protein biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen at femtomolar concentrations with high sensitivity in clinically relevant serum samples [7]. Real-time assays of the binding, activity, and small-molecule inhibi- tion of telomerase could be performed with this technique using unamplified extracts from as few as 10 tumor cells. This opens up substantial possibilities for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. 2.2 Nucleoprotein Nanodevices for Detection of Cancer Biomarkers DNA Y-junctions have been used as fluorescent scaffolds for EcoRII methyltransferase–thioredoxin (M\u0002EcoRII–Trx) fusion proteins and covalent links were formed between the DNA scaffold and the methyltransferase at preselected sites on the scaffold containing 5FdC [8]. The resulting NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT OF CANCER Molecular diagnostics/ imaging Genomics Proteomics Drug discovery Nanochips Monitoring therapy Diagnostics + therapeutics Pharmaco -genetics Personalized medicine Early detection Targeted drug delivery Biomarkers Fig. 1 Role of nanobiotechnology in the management of cancer. Various nanobiotechnologies have a direct as well as indirect effect on the diagnosis and management of cancer. Many of these technologies interact with each other 246 K.K. Jain thioredoxin-targeted nanodevice was found to bind selectively to certain cell lines but not to others. The fusion protein was constructed so as to permit proteolytic cleavage of the thioredoxin peptide from the nanodevice. Proteoly- sis with thrombin or enterokinase effectively removed the thioredoxin peptide from the nanodevice and extinguished cell line-specific binding measured by fluorescence. Potential applications for devices of this type include the ability of the fused protein to selectively target the nanodevice to certain tumor cell lines and not others, suggesting that this approach can be used to probe cell surface receptors as biomarkers of cancer and may serve as an adjunct to immunohistochemical methods in tumor classification. 3 Nanoparticles for Combined Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy Nanoparticles have refined molecular diagnostics and enabled early detection of tumors and discovery of biomarkers of cancer. Nanoparticles are also therapeutic agents as well as carriers for targeted drug delivery. Main advantage of using nanoparticles in cancer is combining diagnosis with therapy. Important among the several nanoparticles used for this purpose are quantum dots (QDs), dendrimers, nanotubes, and gold or silver nanoparticles. Details of the basic characteristics and comparative advantages as well as drawbacks are discussed elsewhere [9]. 3.1 Gold Nanoparticles Photoacoustic flow cytometry has been used for real-time detection of circulating cells labeled with gold nanorods and the threshold sensitivity is estimated as one cancer cell in the background of 107 normal blood cells. An additional application of this technique is selective nanophotothermolysis of metastatic squamous cells [10]. Gold nanoparticles could play an important role in efficient drug delivery and biomarking of drug-resistant leukemia cells [11]. This could be explored as a novel strategy to inhibit multidrug resistance in targeted tumor cells and as a sensitive method for the early diagnosis of certain cancers. Interaction between the functionalized gold nanoparticles and biologically active molecules on the surface of leukemia cells may also contribute to the observed enhancement in cellular drug uptake. The strong plasmon resonance absorption and photothermal conversion of gold nanoparticles has been exploited in cancer therapy through the selective localized photothermal heating of cancer cells [12]. 3.2 Silver Nanoparticles Silver nanoparticles are bright enough to be seen by eye using optical micro- scopy but unlike fluorophores, fluorescent proteins, or quantum dots, silver Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 247 nanoparticles do not photodecompose during extended illumination. There- fore, they can be used as a probe to continuously monitor dynamic events in living cells during studies that last for weeks or even months and detect early changes in malignancy. Further development of silver nanoparticle-based probes and assays may enable detection and diagnosis of cancer using only a single cell from the patient. Size-tunable and water-soluble silver nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized with the assistance of glutathione. The optical properties of surface-modifiable silver nanoparticles depend on their size and the surface modification. Silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 6 nm effec- tively suppress the proliferation of human leukemia cells in the dose- and time-dependent manners, suggesting their promising application in cancer therapy [13]. 3.3 Quantum Dots Quantum dots (QDs) are crystalline semiconductors composed of a few hundred or a few thousand atoms that emit different colors of light when illuminated by a laser. Stable QDs are made from cadmium selenide and zinc sulfide. Because these probes are stable, they have the ability to remain in a cell’s cytoplasm and nucleus without fading out much longer than conventional fluorescent labels. Their longevity has also made QDs a mole- cular label, allowing scientists to study the earliest signs of cancer and track the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals that target the cellular underpinnings of disease. Conjugation of QDs with biomolecules, including peptides and antibodies, could be used to target tumors in vivo. The specificity and sensitivity of a QD–aptamer–doxorubicin (QD–Apt– DOX) conjugate as a targeted cancer imaging, therapy, and sensing system has been demonstrated in vitro [14]. By functionalizing the surface of fluorescent QD with an RNA aptamer, which recognizes the extracellular domain of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), the system is capable of differential uptake and imaging of prostate cancer cells that express the PSMA. The intercalation of DOX, an anticancer drug with fluorescent properties, in the double-stranded stem of the aptamer results in a targeted conjugate with reversible self-quenching properties based on a Bi-FRET mechanism. A donor–acceptor model FRET between QD and DOX and a donor–quencher model FRET between DOX and aptamer result when DOX is intercalated within the aptamer. This simple multi- functional nanoparticle system can deliver DOX to the targeted prostate cancer cells and sense the delivery of DOX by activating the fluorescence of QD, which concurrently images the cancer cells. 248 K.K. Jain 3.4 Nanotubes Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are highly sensitive to single protein- binding events and can be massively multiplexed with millions of tubes per chip for proteomic profiling. The tubes have extraordinary strength, unique electronic properties, and the ability to tag cancer-specific proteins to their surface. With diameter of 1 nm and length of 1 mm, these tubes are smaller than a single strand of DNA. In other words, each tube is an atomic arrangement of one layer of carbon atoms, which are on the surface. Protein-binding events occurring on the surface of these nanotubes produce a measurable change in the mechanical and electrical properties. By coating the surfaces of nanotubes with MAbs, it is possible to detect cancer cells circulating in the blood. Combination of electrochemical immunosensors using SWCNT and multilabel secondary antibody–nanotube bioconjugates can be used for highly sensitive detection of a cancer biomarker in serum and other body fluids [15]. SWCNT immunosensors are promising for clinical screening of cancer biomarkers and point-of-care diagnostics. Two main strategies are used for using carbon nanotubes with anticancer molecules: they can be either covalently or noncovalently modified to facilitate their manipulation and render them biocompatible [16]. Such soluble/dispersible nano-objects in physiological conditions are then able to penetrate into the cells or they can be administered in vivo to deliver their cargo molecules. Nanotubes are feasible carriers for carboplatin, a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. The drug has been introduced into nanotubes to demonstrate that they are suited as nanocontainers and nanocarriers and can release the drug for therapeutic effect [17]. 3.5 Multifunctional Nanoparticles Two promising approaches for diagnosing and treating cancer have been combined in a targeted multifunctional polymer nanoparticle that successfully images and kills brain tumors in laboratory animals [18]. A 40-nm-diameter polyacrylamide nanoparticle was loaded with Photofrin, a photosensitizing agent, and iron oxide. When irradiated with laser light, Photofrin triggers the production of reactive oxygen species that destroy a wide variety of molecules within a cell. The iron oxide nanoparticles function as an MRI contrast agent and a 31-amino-acid-long peptide targets an unknown receptor found on the surface of new blood vessels growing around tumors as well as triggers cell uptake of nanoparticles attached to it. Because of the targeted delivery of nanoparticles to the tumor, there is enhanced Photofrin exposure within the tumor but less exposure throughout the rest of the body. This allows a larger window for activating the drug with light, which is accomplished by threading a fiber optic laser into the brain. In humans, this approach could reduce or Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 249 eliminate a common side effect of photodynamic therapy, in which healthy skin becomes sensitive to light. Nanoparticle-based diagnostics and therapeutics hold great promise because multiple functions can be built into the particles. One such function is an ability to home to specific sites in the body. Biomimetic particles that not only home to tumors but also amplify their own homing have been described [19]. The system is based on a peptide that recognizes clotted plasma proteins and selectively homes to tumors, where it binds to vessel walls and tumor stroma. Iron oxide nanopar- ticles and liposomes coated with this tumor-homing peptide accumulate in tumor vessels, where they induce additional local clotting, thereby producing new binding sites for more particles. The system mimics platelets, which also circulate freely but accumulate at a diseased site and amplify their own accumulation at that site. The self-amplifying homing is a novel function of nanoparticles. The clotting-based amplification greatly enhances tumor imaging, and the addition of a drug carrier function to the particles is envisioned. 4 Nanotechnology-Based Imaging for Management of Cancer Nanobiotechnology plays an important role in diagnostic molecular imaging of cancer, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomo- graphy (CT). Nanotechnology-based cancer imaging will lead to early detection of cancer and also help accurate delivery of cancer therapy. Newer generations of nanoparticles have been targeted to specific cell types and molecular targets via affinity ligands. 4.1 Nanoparticle CT Scan Current computer tomography (CT) contrast agents are based on small iodinated molecules. They are effective in absorbing X-rays, but nonspecific distribution and rapid pharmacokinetics have rather limited their microvascu- lar and targeting performance. While most of the nanoparticles are designed to be used in conjunction with MRI, bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) nanoparticles naturally accumulate in lymph nodes containing metastases and show up as bright white spots in CT images [20]. A polymer-coated Bi2S3 nanoparticle preparation has been proposed as an injectable CT imaging agent. This pre- paration demonstrates excellent stability at high concentrations, high X-ray absorption (fivefold better than iodine), very long circulation times (>2h)in vivo, and an efficacy/safety profile comparable to or better than iodinated imaging agents. The utility of these polymer-coated Bi2S3 nanoparticles for enhanced in vivo imaging of the vasculature, the liver, and lymph nodes has been demonstrated in mice. These nanoparticles and their bioconjugates are expected to become an important adjunct to in vivo imaging of molecular 250 K.K. Jain targets and pathological conditions. Tumor-targeting agents are now being added to the surfaces of these polymer-coated Bi2S3 nanoparticles. 4.2 Nanoparticles Designed for Dual-Mode Imaging of Cancer The unique optical and electronic properties of QDs such as size-tunable light emission, improved signal brightness, resistance against photobleaching, and simultaneous excitation of multiple fluorescence colors are promising for improving the sensitivity of molecular imaging and quantitative cellular analy- sis by 1–2 orders of magnitude [21]. The best characteristics of QDs and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been combined to create a single nanoparticle probe that can yield clinically useful images of both tumors and the molecules involved in cancer [22]. On average, 10 magnetic iron oxide particles link to a single dye- containing silica nanoparticle, and the resulting construct is approximately 45 nm in diameter. The combination nanoparticle performed better in both MRI and fluorescent imaging tests than did the individual components. In MRI experi- ments, the combination nanoparticle generated an MRI signal that was over threefold more intense than did the same number of iron oxide nanoparticles. Similarly, the fluorescent signal from the dual-mode nanoparticle was almost twice as bright as that produced by dye molecules linked directly to iron oxide nanoparticles. The dual-mode nanoparticles have been labeled with an antibody that binds to molecules known as polysialic acids, which are found on the surface of certain nerve cell and lung tumors. These targeted nanoparticles are quickly taken up by cultured tumor cells and are readily visible using fluorescence microscopy. A novel PAMAM dendrimer-based nanoprobe, G6-(Cy5.5)(1.25)(1B4M- Gd)(145), has been synthesized for dual magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging modalities [23]. The potential of this nanoprobe was demonstrated in vivo by the efficient visualization of sentinel lymph nodes in mice by both MRI and fluorescence imaging modalities. 5 Nanobiotechnology-Based Anticancer Drug Development Nanoparticles have unique properties for potential use in drug discovery and have been used to study the mechanism of anticancer drug action. Some nano- particles are anticancer agents by themselves. Several nanoparticles described in the section on drug delivery in cancer are conjugates of nanoparticles with known anticancer agents. Nanotechnology has also helped to elucidate the mechanism of action of some anticancer drugs. Using single-molecule nanomanipulation by magnetic tweezers has revealed that anticancer drug topotecan, a camptothecin, kills cancer cells by preventing the enzyme DNA topoisomerase I from uncoiling double-stranded DNA in those cells [24]. The DNA becomes locked in tight Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 251 twists, called supercoils, which bulge out from the side of the overwound DNA molecule. If these supercoils accumulate and persist while the cell is trying to separate the two strands of DNA to make exact copies of the chromosomes during cell division, the cells will die. In vivo experiments in the budding yeast verified the resulting prediction that positive supercoils would accumulate during transcription and replication as a consequence of camptothecin poisoning of topoisomerase I. Based on the results of these studies, the supercoil theory was developed to explain camptothecins’ cytotoxic effect, which could help in the clinical development of these agents. Examples of nanoscale drug candidates include nanobodies, which are vari- able domains of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies. These have advantages compared with classical antibodies in that they are small, very stable, easy to produce in large quantities, and easy to reformat into multivalent or multi- specific proteins. In vivo studies have demonstrated that nanobody conjugates have an excellent biodistribution profile and induced regression and cure of established tumor xenografts. The easy generation and manufacturing yield of nanobody-based conjugates together with their potent antitumor activity makes nanobodies promising vehicles for new generation cancer therapeutics. Nanobodies can be specifically selected for a desired function by phage anti- body display. Nanobodies selected by this method were found to efficiently inhibit EGF binding to the EGFR without acting as receptor agonists themselves [25]. In addition, they blocked EGF-mediated signaling and EGF-induced cell proliferation. 6 Nanobiotechnology-Based Drug Delivery in Cancer Drug delivery in cancer is important for optimizing the effect of drugs and reducing toxic side effects. Several nanobiotechnologies, mostly based on nanoparticles, have been described to facilitate drug delivery in cancer. Some innovative nanoparticle formulations for drug delivery include encap- sulating drugs in nanoparticles (Table 1). The main advantage of various nanotechnology-based formulation is to overcome poor solubility of most anticancer drugs. Polymer micelles are becoming a powerful nanotherapeutic platform that affords several advantages for targeted drug delivery in cancer, including increased drug solubility, pro- longed circulation half-life, selective accumulation at tumor sites, and a decrease in toxicity. However, the technology still lacks tumor specificity and controlled release of the entrapped agents. Therefore, the focus has gradually shifted from passive targeting micelles to active targeting and responsive sys- tems that carry additional mechanisms for site-specific release. Ligand-tar- geted, pH-sensitive formulations are examples of how versatility of micelles can lead to a fusion of chemical customization with biological insight to achieve targeted drug delivery. 252 K.K. Jain Table 1 Examples of nanobiotechnology-based formulations for drug delivery in cancer Technology Description Application References Encapsulating drugs in hydrogel nanoparticles 2-nm-diameter polyacrylamide nanoparticles lacking charge on their surfaces, which prevents blood proteins from sticking to their surfaces For delivery of photosensitizer meta- tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin for head and neck cancer 26 Block copolymer micelles The core is a loading space for hydrophobic drugs, and the shell is a hydrophilic corona that makes the micelle water soluble, thereby allowing delivery of the poorly soluble contents For delivery of camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that is effective against cancer but insoluble 27 Filomicelles: polymer micelle Persisted in the circulation up to 1 W after intravenous injection – 10 times longer than their spherical counterparts.

This is achieved by the incorporation of molecular sensors that are able to respond to physical or biological stimuli, including changes in pH, redox potential, or enzymes. Tumor-targeting principles include systemic passive targeting and active recep- tor targeting. Physical forces (e.g., electric or magnetic fields, ultrasound, hyperthermia or light) may contribute to focusing and triggered activation of nanosystems. Biological drugs delivered with programmed nanosystems also include plasmid DNA, siRNA, and other therapeutic nucleic acids. A drug delivery system has been developed to destroy tumors more effec- tively by using synthesized smart nanoparticles that target and kill cancer cells while sparing healthy cells [33]. The system is intended to improve the efficiency of cancer treatment. These particles are injected intravenously into the blood circulation. Each of the particles can recognize the cancer cell, anchor itself to it, and diffuse inside the cell. Once inside, the particle disintegrates causing a nearly instantaneous release of the drug precisely where it is needed. Nano- particles are chemically programmed to have an affinity for the cell wall of tumors. To be effective, the particles must evade being recognized by the body’s reticuloendothelial system, penetrate into the cancer cells, and discharge the drugs before being recognized by the cancer cells. Advantages of this system are the following: \u0002 This system can fool cancer cells, which are very good at detecting and rejecting drugs. \u0002 It provides very rapid drug delivery at sufficiently high concentration that can overwhelm the cancer cell’s resistance mechanisms. \u0002 It should reduce side effects because it targets only the cancer cells. 7.1 Innovations in Dendrimers for Anticancer Drug Delivery Earlier studies of dendrimers in drug delivery systems focused on their use for encapsulating drug molecules. However, it was difficult to control the release of the drug. New developments in polymer and dendrimer chemistry have provided a new class of molecules called ‘‘dendronized polymer,’’ i.e., linear polymer that bears dendrons at each repeat unit. Their behavior differs from that of linear polymers and provides drug delivery advantages because of their longer circulation time. Another approach is to attach the drug to the periphery of the dendrimer so that the release of the drug can be controlled by incorporating a degradable linkage between the drug and the dendrimer. 254 K.K. Jain Doxorubicin (DOX) has been conjugated to a biodegradable dendrimer with optimized blood circulation time through size and molecular architecture, drug loading through multiple attachment sites, solubility through PEGylation, and drug release through the use of pH-sensitive hydrazone linkages [34]. In culture, dendrimer–DOX was >10 times less toxic than free DOX toward colon carci- noma cells. Upon intravenous administration to tumor-bearing mice, tumor uptake of dendrimer–DOX was ninefold higher than intravenous free DOX. In efficacy studies it caused complete tumor regression and 100% survival of the mice over the 60-day experiment. No cures were achieved in tumor-implanted mice treated with free DOX, drug-free dendrimer, or dendrimer–DOX in which the DOX was attached by means of a stable carbamate bond. The antitumor effect of dendrimer–DOX was similar to that of an equimolar dose of liposomal DOX (Doxil). The remarkable antitumor activity of dendrimer–DOX results from the ability of the dendrimer to favorably modulate the pharmacokinetics of attached DOX. 7.2 Nanoparticles for Enhancing Tumor Targeting by Antibodies Although it was previously possible to attach drug molecules directly to antibodies, attaching more than a handful of drug molecules to an antibody significantly limits its targeting ability because the chemical bonds that are used to attach the drugs tend to block the targeting centers on the antibody’s surface. A number of nanoparticles have been investigated to overcome this limitation. Tumor-targeting SWCNT constructs have been synthesized by covalently attaching multiple copies of tumor-specific MAbs, radiometal–ion chelates, and fluorescent probes [35]. A new class of anticancer compounds have been created that contain both tumor-targeting antibodies and nanoparticles called fullerenes (C60), which can be loaded with several molecules of anticancer drugs like Taxol1 [36]. It is possible to load as many as 40 fullerenes into a single skin cancer antibody called ZME-018, which can be used to deliver drugs directly into melanoma tumors. Certain binding sites on the antibody are hydrophobic (water repelling) and attract the hydrophobic fullerenes in large numbers, so multiple drugs can be loaded into a single antibody in a spontaneous manner. No covalent bonds are required, so the increased payload does not significantly change the targeting ability of the antibody. The real advantage of fullerene immunotherapy over other targeted therapeutic agents is likely the fullerene’s potential to carry multiple drug payloads, such as Taxol plus other chemother- apeutic drugs. Cancer cells can become drug resistant, and one can cut down on the possibility of their escaping treatment by attacking them with more than one kind of drug at a time. The first fullerene immunoconjugates have been pre- pared and characterized as an initial step toward the development of fullerene immunotherapy. Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 255 7.3 Nanocarriers to Improve Cancer-Targeting Therapy Various nanomaterials have been used to deliver anticancer drugs and are simply referred to as nanocarriers. This can be passive delivery but other strategies can be combined to use nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery in cancer. One example of this is transforming growth factor (TGF)-b, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of progression of cancer through effects on tumor microenvironment as well as on cancer cells. TGF-b inhibitors have recently been shown to prevent the growth and metastasis of certain cancers. However, there may be adverse effects caused by TGF-b signaling inhibition, including the induction of cancers by the repression of TGF-b-mediated growth inhibition. A short-acting, small-molecule TGF-b type I receptor (TR-I) inhibi- tor has been used at a low dose in treating several experimental intractable solid tumors, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and diffuse-type gastric cancer, characterized by hypovascularity and thick fibrosis in tumor microenvironments [37]. Low-dose TR-I inhibitor altered neither TGF-b signaling in cancer cells nor the amount of fibrotic components. However, it decreased pericyte coverage of the endothelium without reducing endothelial area specifically in tumor neovas- culature and promoted accumulation of macromolecules, including anticancer nanocarriers, in the tumors. Compared with the absence of TGF-b-I inhibitor, anticancer nanocarriers exhibited potent growth-inhibitory effects on these cancers in the presence of TR-I inhibitor. The use of TR-I inhibitor combined with nanocarriers may thus be of significant clinical and practical importance in treating intractable solid cancers. 7.4 Gold Nanoparticles for Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer The unique chemical properties of colloidal gold make it a promising targeted delivery approach for drugs or genes to specific cells. The physical and chemical properties of colloidal gold permit more than one protein molecule to bind to a single particle of colloidal gold. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a can be bound to gold nanocrystals and targeted effectively to tumors in experimental animals following intravenous delivery. The cytotoxicity of TNF-a is confined to the tumor and normal tissues are spared. Anticancer drugs based on this technol- ogy are in preclinical development. Biocompatible and nontoxic pegylated gold nanoparticles with surface- enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) have been used for in vivo tumor targeting and detection [38]. These pegylated SERS nanoparticles are considerably brighter than semiconductor QDs with light emission in the near-infrared window. When conjugated to tumor-targeting ligands such as single-chain variable fragment antibodies, the conjugated nanoparticles are able to target tumor biomarkers such as epithelial growth factor receptors (EGFRs) on human cancer cells and in xenograft tumor models. 256 K.K. Jain 7.5 Carbon Nanotubes for Targeted Drug Delivery to Cancer Cells An improved delivery scheme for intracellular tracking and anticancer ther- apy uses a novel double functionalization of a carbon nanotube delivery system containing antisense oligodeoxynucleotides as a therapeutic gene and CdTe QDs as fluorescent labeling probes via electrostatically layer-by-layer assembling [39]. Chemically functionalized single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have shown promise in tumor-targeted accumulation in mice and exhibit biocompat- ibility, excretion, and little toxicity. The anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) has been conjugated to branched PEG chains on SWCNTs via a cleavable ester bond to obtain a water-soluble SWCNT–PTX conjugate [40]. SWCNT–PTX is more efficient than Taxol in suppressing tumor growth in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model, owing to prolonged blood circulation and 10-fold higher tumor PTX uptake by SWCNT delivery, likely through enhanced permeability and retention. Drug molecules carried into the reticuloendothelial system are released from SWCNTs and excreted via biliary pathway without toxic effects on normal organs. Thus, nanotube drug delivery is promising for enhancing treatment efficacy and minimizing side effects of cancer therapy with low drug doses. Water-dispersed carbon nanohorns (similar to nanotubes), prepared by adsorption of polyethylene glycol–doxorubicin conjugate (PEG–DOX) onto oxidized single-wall carbon nanohorns, have been shown to be effective antic- ancer drug delivery carriers when administered intratumorally to human non- small cell lung cancer-bearing mice [41]. There was significant retardation of tumor growth associated with prolonged DOX retention in the tumor. Although considerable further work is required before any new drugs based on carbon nanotubes are developed, it is hoped that it will eventually lead to more effective treatments for cancer. However, it is too early to claim whether carbon-based nanomaterials will become clinically viable tools to combat cancer, although there is definitely room for them to complement existing technologies. 7.6 Polymersomes for Targeted Cancer Drug Delivery Polymersomes, hollow-shell nanoparticles, have unique properties that allow them to deliver two distinct drugs, paclitaxel and doxorubicin, directly to tumors implanted in mice [42]. Loading, delivery, and cytosolic uptake of drug mixtures from degradable polymersomes are shown to exploit both the thick membrane of these block copolymer vesicles and their aqueous lumen as well as pH-triggered release within endolysosomes. Drug-delivering polymersomes break down in the acidic environment of the cancer cells resulting in targeted release of these drugs within tumor cells. While cell membranes and liposomes (vesicles often used for drug delivery) are created from a double layer of fatty molecules called phospholipids, a polymersome is composed of two layers of synthetic polymers. Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 257 The individual polymers are degradable and considerably larger than individual phospholipids but have many of the same chemical features. The large polymers making up the shell allow paclitaxel, which is water insoluble, to embed within the shell. Doxorubicin, which is water soluble, stays within the interior of the polymersome until it degrades. The polymersome and drug combination is self- assembling as the structure spontaneously forms when all of the components are suitably mixed together. Recent studies have shown that cocktails of paclitaxel and doxorubicin lead to better tumor regression than either drug alone, but previously there was no carrier system that could carry both drugs efficiently to a tumor. Polymersomes get around those limitations. Another approach is by assembling diverse bioactive agents, such as DNA, proteins, and drug molecules, into core–shell multifunctional polymeric nano- particles (PNPs) that can be internalized in human breast cancer cells [43]. Using ring-opening metathesis polymerization, block copolymers containing small-molecule drug segments and tosylated hexaethylene glycol segments were prepared and assembled into PNPs that allowed for the surface conjugation of single-stranded DNA sequences and/or tumor-targeting antibodies. The result- ing antibody-functionalized particles were readily uptaken by breast cancer cells that overexpressed the corresponding antigens. 7.7 Polymer Nanoparticles for Targeted Drug Delivery in Prostate Cancer A prostate-specific, locally delivered gene therapy has been developed for the targeted killing of prostate cells using C32/DT-A, a degradable polymer nano- particulate system, to deliver a diphtheria toxin suicide gene (DT-A) driven by a prostate-specific promoter to cells [44]. These nanoparticles were directly injected to the normal prostate and to prostate tumors in mice. Nearly 50% of normal prostates showed a significant reduction in size, attributable to cellular apopto- sis, whereas injection with naked DT-A-encoding DNA had little effect. A single injection of C32/DT-A nanoparticles triggered apoptosis in 80% of tumor cells present in the tissue. It is expected that multiple nanoparticle injections would trigger a greater percentage of prostate tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. These results suggest that local delivery of polymer/DT-A nanoparticles may have application in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate can- cer. Nonviral gene delivery using nanoparticles avoids the undesirable effects of viral vectors and has a higher transfection rate of tumor cells. 7.8 Use of Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery in Glioblastoma Multiforme Treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a primary malignant tumor of the brain, is one of the most challenging problems as no currently available 258 K.K. Jain treatment is curative. The currently available anticancer therapeutics have less than optimal usefulness for GBM mainly because of delivery problems to the tumor. Nanotechnology-based methods have been shown to enhance the delivery of therapeutic substances to GBM by improving targeting, passage across BBB, controlled release, and by reducing the amount of anticancer drugs required for effectiveness with resulting reduction in toxic adverse effects [45]. Several types of nanoparticles have been used to enhance drug delivery to GBM but liposome-based methods are considered to be among the promising meth- ods. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles can be used in conjunction with MRI to localize the tumor as well as for subsequent thermoablation. Further research in nanobiotechnology-based delivery methods will be required as innovative methods for treatment of GBM are in development. 7.9 Nanoparticle-Based Anticancer Drug Delivery to Overcome MDR Although multidrug resistance (MDR) is known to develop through a variety of molecular mechanisms within the tumor cell, many tend to converge toward the alteration of apoptotic signaling. The enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), responsible for bioactivation of the proapoptotic mediator ceramide to a nonfunctional moiety glucosylceramide, is overexpressed in many MDR tumor types and has been implicated in cell survival in the presence of chemotherapy. A study has investigated the therapeutic strategy of coadministering ceramide with paclitaxel in an attempt to restore apoptotic signaling and overcome MDR in the human ovarian cancer cell line using modified poly(E-caprolactone) (PEO–PCL) nanoparticles to encapsulate and deliver the therapeutic agents for enhanced efficacy [46]. Results show that indeed the complete population of MDR cancer cells can be eradicated by this approach. Moreover, with nanopar- ticle drug delivery, the MDR cells can be resensitized to a dose of paclitaxel near the IC50 of non-MDR (drug sensitive) cells, indicating a 100-fold increase in chemosensitization via this approach. Molecular analysis of activity verified the hypothesis that the efficacy of this therapeutic approach is due to a restoration in apoptotic signaling, although the beneficial properties of PEO–PCL nanoparticle delivery enhanced the therapeutic success even further, showing the promising potential for the clinical use of this therapeutic strategy to overcome MDR. 8 Nanoparticles Adjuncts to Physical Methods of Cancer Therapy Several physical methods of therapy are used in cancer besides radiotherapy. These include photodynamic therapy, lasers, ultrasound, and thermotherapy. Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 259 8.1 Nanoparticles as Adjuncts to Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses light-activated drugs called photosensitizers to treat a range of diseases characterized by rapidly growing tissues, including the formation of abnormal blood vessels, such as cancer, and age-related macular degeneration. Some new developments in the use of nanoparticles in PDT are described in this section. A nanocarrier consisting of polymeric micelles of diacylphospholipid– poly(ethylene glycol) (PE–PEG) coloaded with the photosensitizer drug 2- [1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH) and magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles has been used for guided drug delivery together with light- activated photodynamic therapy for cancer [47]. The nanocarrier shows excel- lent stability and activity over several weeks. The loading efficiency of HPPH is practically unaffected upon coloading with the magnetic nanoparticles, and its phototoxicity is retained. The magnetic response of the nanocarriers was demonstrated by their magnetically directed delivery to tumor cells in vitro. The magnetophoretic control on the cellular uptake provides enhanced imaging and phototoxicity. These multifunctional nanocarriers demonstrate the exciting prospect offered by nanochemistry for targeting photodynamic therapy. In a novel nanoformulation for PDT of cancer, the photosensitizer molecules are covalently incorporated into organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) nanoparticles [48]. The incorporated photosensitizer molecules retain their spectroscopic and functional properties and can robustly generate cytotoxic singlet oxygen molecules upon photoirradiation. The synthesized nanoparticles are of ultralow size (approximately 20 nm) and are highly monodispersed and stable in aqueous suspension. The advantage offered by this covalently linked nanofabrication is that the drug is not released during systemic circulation, which is often a problem with physical encapsulation. These nanoparticles are also avidly taken up by tumor cells in vitro and demonstrate phototoxic action, thereby improving the diagnosis as well as PDT of cancer. 8.2 Ultrasonic Tumor Imaging and Targeted Chemotherapy by Nanobubbles Drug delivery in polymeric micelles combined with tumor irradiation by ultra- sound results in effective drug targeting, but this technique requires prior tumor imaging. A new targeted drug delivery method uses ultrasound to image tumors, while also releasing the drug from nanobubbles into the tumor [49]. Mixtures of drug-loaded polymeric micelles and perfluoropentane (PFP) nano- bubbles stabilized by the same biodegradable block copolymer were prepared. Size distribution of nanoparticles was measured by dynamic light scattering. Cavitation activity (oscillation, growth, and collapse of microbubbles) under ultrasound was assessed based on the changes in micelle/nanobubble volume 260 K.K. Jain ratios. The effect of the nanobubbles on the ultrasound-mediated cellular uptake of doxorubicin (DOX) in MDA MB231 breast tumors in vitro and in vivo (in mice bearing xenograft tumors) was determined by flow cytometry. Phase state and nanoparticle sizes were sensitive to the copolymer/perfluoro- carbon volume ratio. At physiological temperatures, nanodroplets converted into nanobubbles. Doxorubicin was localized in the nanobubble walls formed by the block copolymer. Upon intravenous injection into mice, DOX-loaded micelles and nanobubbles extravasated selectively into the tumor interstitium, where the nanobubbles coalesced to produce microbubbles. When exposed to ultrasound, the bubbles generated echoes, which made it possible to image the tumor. The sound energy from the ultrasound popped the bubbles, releasing DOX, which enhanced intracellular uptake by tumor cells in vitro to a statisti- cally significant extent relative to that observed with unsonicated nanobubbles and unsonicated micelles and resulted in tumor regression in the mouse model. In conclusion, multifunctional nanoparticles that are tumor-targeted drug carriers, long-lasting ultrasound contrast agents, and enhancers of ultrasound-mediated drug delivery have been developed and deserve further exploration as cancer therapeutics. 8.3 Nanobomb for Cancer Nanobombs are tiny bombs on nanoscale, which are selective, localized, and minimally invasive. Like cluster bombs, they start exploding one after another once they are exposed to light and the resulting heat. The nanobomb holds great promise as a therapeutic agent for killing cancer cells, particularly breast cancer cells, because its shock wave kills the cancerous cells as well as the biological pathways that carry instructions to generate additional cancerous cells and the small blood vessels that nourish the tumor. Its effect can be spread over a wide area to create structural damage to the surrounding cancer cells. In another approach, Nanoclusters (gold nanobombs) can be activated in cancer cells only by confining near-infrared laser pulse energy within the critical mass of the nanoparticles in the nanocluster [10]. Once the nanobombs are exploded and kill cancer cells, macrophages can effectively clear the cell debris and the exploded nanotube along with it. 8.4 Thermotherapy of Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Nanoparticles Thermotherapy using biocompatible superparamagnetic nanoparticles has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer [50]. The magnetic fluid was injected transperineally into the prostates and hyperthermic to thermoablative temperatures were achieved in the prostates Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 261 at 25% of the available magnetic field strength, indicating a significant potential for higher temperatures. Another study has used monoclonal anti- body-linked iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles to evaluate nanoparticle thermotherapy of human prostate cancer cell line by heating the magnetic component of the probes through an externally applied alternating magnetic field [51]. The study also explored the potential enhancement of the anticancer effect through added external beam radiation therapy because both forms of treatment have a different, and potentially complementary, mechanism of causing cell death. Results showed that nanoparticle thermotherapy applied as a single modality caused cell death that correlated with total heat dose estimation. Because complete cell death occurred with this approach alone, enhancement of the effect through the addition of external beam radiation therapy could not be addressed. In vitro studies have demonstrated that gold nanorods are novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy [52]. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibo- dies (MAbs) and incubated in cancer cell cultures. The anti-EGFR antibody- conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malig- nant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time. To ensure accumulation of nanoparticles in neoplastic tissue, targeting ligands such as antibodies and targeted gene therapy vectors are being incorporated into the nanoparticles, which act as thermal scalpels upon laser irradiation and destroy tumor tissue [53]. 8.5 Application of Nanoparticles in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) offers a potential method for localized destruction of tumor cells. The technology is based on the nuclear reaction between thermal neutrons and boron-10 (10B) to yield alpha particles and lithium-7 nuclei. The destructive effect of this reaction is limited to a range of about the diameter of a single cell. In order for BNCT to be effective in cancer therapy, there must be selective delivery of an adequate concentration of 10B to tumors. Various types of antibodies as well as epidermal growth factor have been utilized to investigate receptor-mediated boron delivery; however, in vivo studies have demonstrated that only a small percentage of the total 262 K.K. Jain administered dose actually accumulates in tumors, while high concentrations end up in the liver. Interest in classical BCNT faded because of the lack of efficacy but new strategies have been employed to enhance the effect of BNCT including the use of nanoparticles. The use of dendrimers as boron carriers for antibody conjugation is based on their well-defined structure and multivalency. Boronated PAMAM dendrimers have been designed to target the epidermal growth factor receptor, a cell surface receptor that is frequently overexpressed in brain tumor cells. Preclinical evaluation has been described of a multipurpose STARBURST PAMAM (polyamidoamine) dendrimer prototype (Dendritic Nanotechnologies Inc.) that exhibits properties suitable (i) for use as targeted, diagnostic MRI/near-infrared contrast agents and/or (ii) for controlled delivery of cancer therapies [54]. The lead candidate is 1,4-diaminobutane, a dendritic nanostructure \u00035 nm in diameter, which was selected on the basis of a very favorable biocompatibility profile on in vitro studies, i.e., benign and nonimmunogenic. 9 Nanobiotechnology-Based Aids to Cancer Surgery Several applications of nanobiotechnology in cancer surgery include the use of nanoparticles to visualize tumor during surgery as aid to proper removal. 9.1 Lymph Node Mapping in Cancer Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is a common procedure used to identify the presence of cancer in a single, ‘‘sentinel’’ lymph node, thus avoiding the removal of a patient’s entire lymph system. Effective and rapid (few minutes) detection of SLN using fluorescent imaging of QDs has been demonstrated in experimental animals and is relevant to axillary lymph node dissection during surgery of breast cancer [55]. The use of QD imaging is a significant improvement over the dye/radioactivity method currently used to perform SLN mapping, enabling the surgeon to see not only the lymph nodes but also the underlying anatomy. The imaging system and QDs allow the pathologist to focus on specific parts of the SLN that would be most likely to contain malignant cells, if cancer were present. The imaging system and QDs minimize inaccuracies and permit real-time confirmation of the total removal of the target lymph nodes, drastically reducing the potential for repeated procedures. SLN mapping has already revolutionized cancer surgery. Near-infrared QDs have the potential to improve this important technique even further. Because the QDs in the study are composed of heavy metals, which can be toxic, they have not yet been approved for use in humans. The next step is to develop QDs that can be used safely in human trials. Application of Nanobiotechnology in Cancer Therapeutics 263 9.2 Nanotechnology-Based Devices as Aids to the Detection of Cancer During Surgery Cancer surgeons are faced with the difficult task of knowing where to stop cutting when removing cancer cells in the body. Sensor nanodevices for detec- tion can attain resolution of \u000320 mm or even less. As this dimension is compar- able to single cell dimension, it may be possible to see a single cancer cell in a tissue. High-resolution thermal imaging devices and ultrasound detector might provide a much better image resolution to enable detection of malignant tumors at early stages. 10 Nanobiotechnology for the Management of Metastatic Cancer Early detection of metastases plays an important role in the management of metastatic cancer. In patients with prostate cancer who undergo surgical lymph node resection or biopsy, MRI with lymphotropic superparamagnetic nanoparticles can correctly identify all patients with nodal metastases. This diagnosis is not possible with conventional MRI alone and has implications for the management of men with metastatic prostate cancer, in whom adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy with radiation is the mainstay of management. Nanoparticle formulations of anticancer drugs may be more effective against cancer metastases. Oral administration of a-TEA formulated in liposome or biodegradable poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticle has been shown to significantly reduce tumor burden in a mammary cancer mouse model [56]. Both formulations reduced lymph node and lung micrometastatic tumor foci, but nanoparticle formulation was more effective in reducing metastases. Tumor targeting with nanoparticles facilitates systemic delivery of immunomodulatory cytokine genes to remote sites of cancer metastasis. Targeted delivery and localized expression of the intravenously administered nanoparticles bearing the gene encoding granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor was con- firmed in a patient with metastatic cancer, as was the recruitment of significant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [57]. 11 Role of Nanobiotechnology in Personalized Cancer Therapy Personalized medicine simply means the prescription of specific therapeutics best suited for an individual. It is usually based on pharmacogenetic, pharmacoge- nomic, and pharmacoproteomic information but other individual variations in patients are also taken into consideration. In case of cancer, the variation in behavior of cancer of the same histological type from one patient to another is also taken into consideration. Nanodiagnostics have also improved diagnosis of cancer, which is an important basis of personalized treatment. 264 K.K. Jain Nanobiotechnology is facilitating the discovery of molecular biomarkers that are used to predict disease development, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment in individual patients. Personalized oncology is based on a better understanding of the cancer at the molecular level and nanotechnology will play an important role in this area [58]. An example is QDs conjugated with monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody (Trastuzumab), which can be used for single molecular in vivo imaging of breast cancer cells in a 3D microscopic system [59]. Cancer cells expressing HER2 protein can be visualized by the nanoparticles in vivo at subcellular resolution, enabling personalized decision on chemotherapy based on HER2-positive or HER2-negative status of the tumor. Nanoparticle-based diagnosis combined with targeted delivery of appropri- ate anticancer therapy enables personalized treatment of a tumor sparing the patient of systemic toxicity and obviating the need for pharmacogenetic testing. With numerous nanotechnologies available for drug delivery, computational mathematical tools are recommended for selection of nanovectors, surface modifications, therapeutic agents, and penetration enhancers for optimal use in a multistage-targeted drug delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to a tumor leading to significant improvements in therapy efficacy and reduced systemic toxicity [60]. Such an approach can be optimized for personalized oncology. 12 Concluding Remarks and Future Prospects The basic rationale for using nanobiotechnology in oncology is that nanopar- ticles have optical, magnetic, or structural properties that are not available from larger molecules or bulk solids. When linked with tumor-targeting ligands such as MAbs, peptides, or small molecules, these nanoparticles can be used to target tumor antigens (biomarkers) as well as tumor vasculatures with high affinity and specificity [61]. In the size range of 5–100 nm diameter, nanoparticles have large surface areas and functional groups for conjugating to multiple diagnostic and therapeutic anticancer agents. Recent advances have led to bioaffinity nanoparticle probes for molecular and cellular imaging, targeted nanoparticle drugs for cancer therapy, and integrated nanodevices for early cancer detection and screening. Another important role of nanoparticles is in integrating diagnosis and treatment of cancer. These developments have provided opportunities for personalized oncology in which biomarkers are used to diagnose and treat cancer based on the molecular profiles of individual patients. Nanobiotechnology has also provided refinements in aids to surgery of cancer and for guidance of thorough extirpation of cancer. Further improvements in QD technology will refine identification of meta- static cancer cells, enable quantification of the level of specific molecular targets, and guide targeted cancer therapy by providing biodynamic biomarkers for target inhibition [62].

Jain Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors Christian Dohmen and Manfred Ogris 1 Introduction In the last decades, many approaches have been tried for the treatment of cancers. The most common therapies so far are surgery, radiation and che- motherapy or combination thereof. Despite significant improvements, these therapies still lack tumor specificity and can cause severe side effects. Therefore, developing new therapies and methods for cancer treatment is a demanding issue in medical science. A promising approach is the delivery of proteins and peptides to tumor cells with the aim of reprogramming or their destruction. This method has the advantage of being a well-controllable system: proteins can be modulated to be more stable, less toxic, more specific, and resistant against proteases or in case of enzymes optimized in terms of activity. Due to the controllable half-life of a protein inside a cell, the therapeutic effect can be regulated. State-of-the-art protein chemistry and analysis allows molecular modeling to optimize the protein structure prior to delivery. Due to the advantages of direct protein delivery to tumors, this field gained significant importance as a new approach in tumor therapy. Here, we will discuss all aspects of targeted protein delivery to tumors, including protein/peptide design, general delivery strategies, targeting aspects, and intracellular hurdles for protein delivery. An overview is given for proteins and peptides currently used in preclinical studies; ongoing clinical studies and applications in the clinics are discussed. 2 Protein Expression and Chemical Modifications, Cleavability To develop a targeted protein delivery system, a functional domain (the ther- apeutically active protein) has to be connected to a targeting domain, which directs the therapeutic protein to the site of desired action, i.e., tumor tissue. In M. Ogris (*) Pharmaceutical Biology-Biotechnology, Ludwig-Maximilians Universita¨ t, Mu¨ nchen, Germany e-mail: manfred.ogris@cup.uni-muenchen.de Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_9, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 269 principle, these protein systems can be produced in two ways: either by produc- tion and subsequent isolation of recombinant fusion proteins or by covalent coupling of targeting and function domain by means of chemical protein conjugation techniques. 2.1 Recombinant Fusion Proteins Target proteins can be generated by expressing fusion protein containing the targeting and the effector domain. Depending on the protein expressed and the necessary posttranslational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), this can be accomplished either in bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells [1]. Potential pro- blems due to protein insolubility and formation of inclusion bodies have to be kept in mind. Attaching a polypeptide fusion partner, termed affinity tag, allows specific purification by affinity chromatography [2]. To minimize the influence of protein fusion on the structure of the two domains and to enable a possible cleavage (see below), a peptidic spacer can be engineered to separate the two fusion partners. A disadvantage of producing fusion proteins is the limited alternative to modulate the system: the two domains can be intercon- nected only via their N- or C-terminus. 2.2 Chemical Conjugates An alternative to the molecular biological approach is the chemical conjugation of functional domains. The major advantage is the high flexibility of the system: in principle, any molecule can be attached to a therapeutic protein (for an excellent overview on coupling chemistry, see [3]). The only features required are functional groups suitable for coupling, for example, free N- or C-terminus containing primary amine or carboxy function, respectively. Within the mole- cule, the epsilon amino group of lysine, free sulfhydryl from cysteine, or specific glycosylation sites can be used for site-specific modification. A plethora of linker molecules exist (reviewed in [4]). Cross-linking can be achieved either via homo- or heterobifunctional cross- linking. With a symmetric, bifunctional cross-linker, two similar reactive groups present on targeting and effector molecule are linked, e.g., two amines or two sulfhydryl groups. The advantage of this approach is having only one reaction step being necessary for synthesis. The main disadvantage is the occurrence of a mixture of homodimeric (e.g., two targeting molecules) and the desired heterodimeric (targeting and effector function) conjugates. With a heterobifunctional asymmetric linker, two different functional moieties can be linked. For example, 1-ethyl-3- [3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydro- chloride (EDC) is a coupling reagent frequently used for coupling effector domains to antibodies forming a stable amide bond between a carboxy group 270 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris and a primary amine. The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of an activating agent, such as N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) [5]. N- Succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP) is a heterobifunctional cross-linker bearing an amine-reactive succinimidyl ester on one end and a protected and activated thiol group (thiopyridyl) on the distal end [6]. With the help of SPDP, free thiol groups (e.g., cysteine residues) can be directly coupled to primary amines via a reducible disulfide bond. A related heterobifunctional linker is sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclo- hexane-1-carboxylate (Sulfo-SMCC) containing an amine-reactive sulfosuccinimidyl- and a sulfhydryl-reactive maleimide group, which forms a stable thioether bond. When utilizing glycosylated proteins like antibodies or the serum protein transferrin, sugar residues can be oxidized by adding period- ate and the resulting aldehyde function reacts with primary amines forming a Schiff base. This bond can be reduced to a more stable amine bond by adding sodium cyanoborohydride. The selectivity of this coupling procedure is insofar of advantage as proteins are specifically coupled via glycosylation sites. Many more coupling strategies have been developed in the recent years and the cross- linking molecules are commercially available [4]. 2.3 Designing the Bond When targeting therapeutic proteins to tumors, bifunctional molecules contain- ing a targeting and a functional domain are generated. Depending on the intracellular function of the protein, cleavability between these two domains is often necessary to enable full functionality of the effector domain. Intracel- lular cleavage can be achieved in different ways. After receptor-mediated endo- cytosis, endosomes become acidified to pH below 6. In this case, pH-labile bonds, for example, based on acetals can be utilized [7]. Another approach is harnessing the intracellular redox potential leading to the cleavage of disulfide bonds. Several linker molecules exist, which can be specifically cleaved by ubiquitously present enzymes [8]. Furin, an intracellular peptidase, recognizes the cleavage-site sequence Arg-Xaa-Lys/Arg-Arg [9]. Targeting Pseudomonas exotoxin A domain via a Her2 antibody to Her2/neu-overexpressing tumors led to specific cell killing when antibody and toxin were interconnected via a furin- cleavable peptide sequence [10]. Alternative to intracellular cleavage, the toxin can also be released within the tumor matrix to gain full activity: matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are often overexpressed by tumor cells and respon- sible for their invasiveness [11]. Generating protein conjugates containing an MMP-cleavable peptide sequence can now lead to tumor site-specific activation of such a conjugate, as it has been shown for PEG-modified liposomes [12]. In any case it has to be kept in mind that, for example, diester and disulfide bonds can also be cleaved in the bloodstream in case of systemic application. This is especially of importance when using long circulating formulation. Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 271 3 Delivery Strategies Reaching tumor tissue can in principle be achieved by two routes of administra- tion: either direct application (intratumoral or topical) or systemic application via the bloodstream. Local application is an issue in case of localized, accessible tumors, like superficial skin melanoma. Delivery of therapeutic proteins in case of metastasized disease or inaccessible tumors can be only achieved via the systemic route. In principle, every solid tumor can be reached via the blood- stream, as above a size of several millimeters, support by the bloodstream with nutrients and oxygen is inevitable and diffusion processes become the limiting factor for further growth. The so-called angiogenic switch induces the formation of blood vessels connecting the tumor tissue to the blood circulation [13]. The main problems are to achieve a certain circulation of proteins in the bloodstream and the necessity of targeting while reducing the nonspecific delivery to other cell types to prevent negative side effects. Within the harsh environment in the bloodstream, proteins and peptides have to be protected against premature degradation. Several delivery concepts have been developed for this purpose. Making the proteins more stable against proteolytic degradation by selectively changing the peptide sequence is one strategy. Alternatively or additionally, proteins and peptides can be covalently modified with hydrophilic polymers to prevent opsonization and subsequent clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). The third option is to generate particulate delivery systems, i.e., where proteins or peptides are encapsulated in micro- or nanometer-sized structures. 3.1 Direct Delivery The most common way for targeted protein delivery to tumors remains systemic application via the bloodstream. For this purpose, the protein has to withstand the harsh environment in the bloodstream, i.e., attacks by proteases. Approaches to increase the conformational stability of proteins can be applied [14]. Changing the physiological L-amino acids to D-amino acids can prevent proteolytic degra- dation and hence improve plasma half-life: octreotide, a 14-amino-acid peptide derived from somatostatin, inhibits pancreatic secretion and is used in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. Due to rapid degradation in the blood- stream, systemic application was limited and required continuous infusion. When shortening the peptide and changing the amino acid conformation from L-to D- enantiomers, a plasma half-life of 1.5 hours was achieved [15]. 3.2 PEGylation Main reasons for a short blood circulation of proteins are renal filtration and excretion by liver and kidney, aggregation with blood components, enzymatic degradation, and opsonization with subsequent RES clearance. Renal filtration and excretion is size dependent: molecules with a molecular weight of less then 272 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris 60 kDa are cleared via kidney [16]. To prevent small proteins from filtration and clearance, the simplest way is to increase the molecular weight of the protein/ peptide. For this purpose, polymers are covalently coupled to the protein sur- face. The most frequently used polymer is polyethylene glycol (PEG) [17], a highly water-soluble polymer available within a broad range of molecular weight and different distal reactive groups allowing convenient coupling to proteins and peptides [18]. Conjugation of PEG (also termed PEGylation) strongly improves the pharmacokinetic of attached proteins [16, 19]. Beside the advantages of preventing clearance, PEG also improves the water solubility of the drug to be delivered and protects from proteolytic degradation and aggregation (for review: [20, 21]). Besides N- and C-terminal modification, disulfide bridges can also be used as specific site of PEGylation [22]. When coupling PEG via amine-reactive or thiol-reactive linker, primary amines within the polypeptide chain (e-amino group in lysine) resp. the terminal sulfhydryl group in cysteine can be modified. This in turn can lead to loss of function due to impaired ligand binding or enzymatic function. To prevent such effects, PEG is attached at a specific site or via a bioreversible cleavable linker. Recombinant interferon-a has been successfully used for treating viral infection and also shows promising antitumoral properties [23, 24]. After systemic appli- cation, interferon is rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, whereas the PEGy- lated version shows significantly improved pharmacokinetic and improved bioactivity in patients [25]. PEG–interferon is now commercialized for hepatitis treatment (Pegasys1 from Roche). In the latter case, PEGylation is carried out with an amine-reactive PEG molecule also potentially modifying lysine in the peptide chain. Bell and coworkers generated a PEGylated interferon where the PEG chain was specifically attached via a maleinimide group to a genetically modified interferon carrying a cysteine with a free thiol group [26]. Experiments on nude mice xenografted with a subcutaneous human tumor clearly showed that site-specific PEGylated interferon exhibited elevated circulation times in blood (Fig. 1) and stronger antitumoral activity compared to randomly PEGy- lated interferon. 3.3 Polymers, Scaffolds, Nanoparticles Therapeutic proteins can be coupled to scaffolds bearing several functional groups. Molecules that can be used as scaffold are, for example, polyamines like polyethylenimine or polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers, which bear several primary amino groups. This allows coupling of several functional molecules in addition to the therapeutically active protein including shielding, targeting, and endosomal release functions. Alternatively, polymers can be attached to a protein with a negative surface charge by simply mixing in water. Due to its positive surface charge, this leads to cationic particles contain- ing both protein and polycation, which in turn promotes cellular internalization Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 273 via heparan sulfates (see below). It was recently shown that glutathione S- transferase (GST)-fused proteins could be coupled to polyethylenimine (PEI) carrying several glutathione molecules, which in turn led to efficient transfer of the payload into cells in vitro [27]. Covalent attachment of PEI via 1-ethyl-3-(3- dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) linker to avidin, streptavidin, and protein G enhanced cellular protein internalization in vitro [28]; in a similar way, PEI-modified fluorescent proteins and antibodies were efficiently internalized [29]. Binding proteins to nondegradable polyamines like PEI also bears the advantage of protecting the protein from degradation. 4 Targeting Strategies Tumor targeting is based on the principle to distinguish between healthy tissue and malignant tumor tissue. In case of systemic delivery, protein formulations exhibiting a certain blood circulation can efficiently reach tumor tissue and extravasate through the leaky tumor vasculature: Maeda et al. first described this passive accumulation as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [30]. Molecules with a molecular weight exceeding the threshold for renal excretion and exhibiting a certain circulation time in blood will passively accumulate in tumor tissue over time. This first phase of tumor targeting is independent of tumor-specific expression of certain tumor markers, and rather due to the tumor architecture. When a solid tumor exceeds a size of 1\u00022 mm, Fig. 1 Plasma concentrations of recombinant IFN-a after subcutaneous injection in rats. Each animal received 100 mg/kg unmodified (full rectangle) or PEGylated (20-kDa PEG, open triangles, 40-kDa PEG, open circles) recombinant IFN-a. Plasma levels of proteins were measured by ELISA (mean\u0003std dev shown for three rats per group). With permission from Ref. [25] 274 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris supply with oxygen and nutrients cannot be accomplished by simple diffusion. At this stage, the so-called angiogenic switch occurs, i.e., tumor cells start to express angiogenic factors resulting in the recruiting of new blood vessels and capillaries to satisfy the increasing demand for nutrients and oxygen [13]. In contrast to normal vasculature, these blood vessels exhibit a leaky architecture and are mosaic like, with endothelial cells and tumor cells forming vessel-like structures [31]. Addition- ally, solid tumors lack a network of functional lymphatic drainage. For this reason, compounds exceeding a certain molecular weight can enter the tumor through the leaky vasculature but cannot be removed by lymphatic drainage or diffuse out of the tumor like low molecular drugs. This implicates that, if a macromolecular drug is delivered systemically, the concentration inside the tumor rises as long as the blood concentration of the drug is high. When the drug is cleared from circulation, high-molecular-weight particles remain in the tumor [32]. After their accumulation in tumor tissue the macromolecular drugs delivered have to be internalized by the target cells. Besides endothelial and stroma cells, tumor cells are the major target for delivery of therapeutically active proteins and peptides. Targeting internalizing receptors does not always increase the total amount of macromolecular drugs accumulated in the tumor but rather potentiates their biological activity due to internalization into the desired target cells. Internalization can appear by direct transduction or by receptor-mediated endocytosis as shown in Fig. 2. 4.1 Proteoglycans and Cationic Ligands Proteoglycans are abundantly expressed on adherent cells and are natural recep- tors for viruses like adeno-associated virus [33] or pathogenic bacteria [34]. Formulations with a net positive charge based on either polycations or cationic lipids have been mostly used for nucleic acid delivery but are in principle also (1) (2) (3) (5) (4) (a) (b) Fig. 2 Steps in cellular protein delivery.(a) Receptor-mediated endocytosis; binding of the cell surface receptor (1) is followed by invagination of the plasma membrane (2) and subsequent inclusion into endsomes (3); specific mechanism leading to rupture of the endosome (4) and access to the cytoplasm (5). (b) Protein transduction can also occur in a receptor-independent fashion Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 275 suitable for protein delivery. It was shown that tumor endothelium has a high preference for binding cationic liposomes [35], whereas with neutral or anionic liposomes, no differences were found between normal and tumor endothelium [36]. It is speculated that a higher density of negative charge on tumor endothelial cells is responsible for such a targeting effect. Proteins can be cationized also by direct chemical modification of their surface: Futami and coworkers cationized negatively charged carboxy groups on the surface of a ribonuclease, which led to subsequent adsorptive endocytosis into target cells [37]. Cationizing the cargo allows to efficiently deliver proteins into a broad range of different adherent cells but can lack specificity in vivo, as systemic application of cationized proteins or particles leads to their opsonization and/or aggregation with blood components and entrapment in the first vascular bed encountered in the lung [38]. 4.2 Integrins and Other Targets on Tumor Endothelium Integrins are a group of transmembrane adhesion proteins expressed in all cell types (except erythrocytes) and act as important mediators of intercellular communication. Exhibiting a heterodimeric structure (usually one alpha sub- unit and one beta subunit) they also play an important role in tumor angiogen- esis also [39]. avb3 integrin is the natural ligand for vitronectin and upregulated in tumor endothelium. By phage display technique (see below) a short peptide structure, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD), was found to be highly selec- tive for tumor vasculature [40]. Zavorni and colleagues expressed the highly potent cytokine TNF-a as a fusion protein containing the RGD sequence after intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA into tumor bearing mice [41]. RGD–TNF-a was released into the bloodstream and efficiently targeted to tumor endothelium. In combination with chemotherapy a clear antitumoral effect was observed (Fig. 3). Similarly, NGR–TNF-a was generated to target aminopeptidase-N that is also upregulated in tumor endothelium and certain tumors. Kessler and colleagues generated RGD- or NGR-containing fusion proteins with tissue factor (tF) [42]. Tissue factor, naturally being present on subendothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets, is a key protein in the initiation of coagulation. When applying recombinant tF as fusion protein with NGR or RGD peptide, thrombotic occlusion of tumor blood vessels was achieved. Only the targeted versions of tF led a therapeutically relevant reduction of tumor growth in nude mice bearing subcutaneous human xenografts. 4.3 Transferrin Receptor The transferrin receptor (TfR) is ubiquitously expressed in tissues like liver and brain but also upregulated in many solid cancers that have high metabolic 276 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris activity and hence the need for iron [43]. Its natural ligand, the plasma protein transferrin (Tf) with a molecular weight of \u000479 kDa, belongs to a superfamily of iron-binding glycoproteins and is located in blood, lymph, and cerebrospinal fluid and mainly responsible for iron transport within the organism [44]. The tertiary structure of the peptide chains consists of two homologues subdomains, each one having binding sites for Fe3+. The iron-free apo-Tf forms a large opening, easy to be reached by Fe3+. Binding of two Fe3+ ions to the binding pockets leads to a conformational change and strongly increases affinity for Fe3+. The release of Fe3+ inside the cell is due to the fast pH drop during endocytosis. Protonation of the amino acids leads to conformational changes and the release of the iron molecule [45]. Following the release of iron, receptor- bound apotransferrin recycles to the cell surface rather than being degraded in lysosomes. The transferrin receptor has been extensively used for targeted drug delivery to tumors, including chemotherapeutics, genes, and proteins [43]. As Tf is a well-soluble plasma protein, drugs coupling to Tf can be advantageous in terms of circulation properties (endogenous Tf has a plasma half-life of 7–10 days) and lack of immune responses against this targeting moiety. In contrast to Tf conjugates, aTfR antibody conjugate does not compete with free Tf for receptor binding and internalization [46]. Applying Tf conjugates containing Tf from the same species will prevent a humoral immune response by the formation of antibodies against Tf, whereas when using aTfR antibodies or Tf from different species, immunogenicity can occur after multiple applications as shown, for example, in a nonhuman primate model using human Tf for targeting [47].Tumor volume at day 14 (mm3) 300 200 100 0NoneMelphpTNF+Melph pRGD–TNF+Melph p = 0.03 p = 0.002pRGD-TNF Fig. 3 Effect of melphalan alone or in combination with pTNF or pRGD–TNF on tumor growth in a subcutaneous RMA-T lymphoma model. Tumor- bearing animals were treated with 240 mg of plasmid DNA (intramuscularly) 3 days after tumor implantation. Two days later, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 50 mg of melphalan. Results are presented as means of five animals per group \u0003 std dev. Modified from Ref. [41] Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 277 4.4 EGF Receptor Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a globular protein of 6.2 kDa consisting of 53 amino acids that binds specifically and with high affinity to the EGF receptor (EGFR) [48]. EGFR, also known as HER1 or ErbB1, belongs to the four members of the ErbB receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases consisting of an N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic trans- membrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain that carries tyrosine kinase activ- ity [49]. Proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival of a wide range of cell types are regulated via EGFR. EGF binding induces dimerization of EGFR [50] and the trans-autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of EGFRs, which in turn leads to subsequent internalization of the activated EGFR complex via clathrin-dependent endocytosis [51]. After inter- nalization, receptors can be sorted to recycling endosomes from which they travel back to the cell surface. Alternatively, they can be directed to lysosomes where they are degraded [52]. EGFR is highly upregulated in many solid tumors including glioblastoma, hepatoma, colon and breast carcinoma [53] and is hence a promising target for tumor-directed therapies. Monoclonal antibodies that bind to EGFR and inhibit EGF-EGFR signaling have been developed and are already in clinical use (see below). Targeting of immunostimulatory- and apoptosis-inducing RNA to EGFR-overexpressing glioblastoma cells led to complete tumor eradication in an orthotopic mouse model [54]. Treatment of EGFR-overexpressing tumors in mice with a systemically applied fusion pro- tein consisting of EGF and the plant-derived toxin saporin led specific anti- tumoral activity [55]; in contrast, when applying toxin without EGF domain or fusion toxin in EGFR-nonoverexpressing tumors, the effect was only moderate. 4.5 Folate Receptor Folate (vitamin B9) is a low-molecular-weight (441 Da) compound essential in cell proliferation and for the biosynthesis of methionine, serine, deoxythymine acid, and purine. Folate is internalized via two independent pathways: either by trans- port of folate by the folate receptor or as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate by the reduced folate carrier. The expression of folate receptor (FR) in healthy tissue is limited to activated macrophages, placental cells, and the apical surface of polarized epithelia, where it is present in different isoforms [56]. The overexpression of FR on a broad range of solid tumors (ovary, lung, breast, kidney, brain, endometrium, and colon) makes it a suitable target for selective tumor drug delivery (for review, see [57]). 4.6 Other Targeting Strategies Tumor targeting can be achieved via known, overexpressed surface receptors being more or less specific for tumor tissue or tumor endothelium. Nevertheless, there is still a plethora of potential targets in different tumor types, which could 278 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris be utilized for drug and protein targeting. A powerful method to discover such potential targets is the phage display technique (for a comprehensive descrip- tion, see [58]). Phage display libraries consist of 109 or more bacteriophages displaying permutated short peptide structures on their surface. Proteins or cells are immobilized to a plastic surface and incubated with the phage library. After removing unbound phages, bound phages are extracted and amplified in host bacteria, hereafter enriched and amplified phages are again incubated with the target and further selected. High-affinity phages are identified after several rounds of selection and their expressed cell-binding peptide sequences identified within the separate phage clones. One of the best known examples is the RGD peptide (see above) being identified by this method, which allows to target drugs to inflamed and tumor endothelium by interacting with integrin avb3. Aptamers are single-stranded nucleotides, which bind with high affinity and specificity to molecular targets. The technology for aptamer selection is termed SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), where combinatorial libraries of synthetic nucleic acids are exponentially enriched in an iterative process in vitro [59]. A nucleic acid library obtained via combinatorial chemistry contains at least 10 14\u000210 15 different DNA or RNA molecules with a random region flanked on both sides with fixed primer sequences for amplifica- tion. As for phage display library, the nucleic acid library is incubated with the target, unbound nucleic acids are removed, bound ones are reisolated, and the selection process is repeated for at least 10 times. After enrichment the library is cloned and sequenced, and individual sequences are investigated for their ability to bind to the target to confirm their specificity. Most recently it was shown that a lysosomal enzyme conjugated to a TfR-specific aptamer was selectively interna- lized via the TfR [60], pointing out the great potential of this technology for protein targeting to tumors [61]. In addition to nucleotide-based aptamers, pep- tide aptamers have been developed to target extracellular and intracellular targets in cancer cells (for review, see [62]). Peptide aptamers consist of up to 20 amino acids and are selected from a random peptide library based on phage display technique (see above). Most peptide aptamers are developed against intracellular targets but can in principle also be designed to target surface molecules expressed on tumor cells. For example, designing a peptide aptamer against matrix metal- loproteinase 9 (MMP-9) led to specific binding and inactivation of MMP-9, which in turn blocked tumor cell migration and invasion [63]. Nakamura and colleagues developed a 9-amino-acid peptide binding to the EGFR and at the same time inhibiting EGFR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation [64]. 5 Intracellular Fate Except for direct membrane passage by protein transduction domains (see section below), payload internalized via endocytic pathways still remains entrapped within intracellular vesicle. However, most therapeutically active Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 279 proteins and peptides have to be released into the cytoplasm and/or have access to the nucleus to gain full functional activity. Viruses and bacteria have devel- oped different peptide-based strategies to evade from endosomes with the help of membrane-active peptide sequences [65] and other ‘‘biomimetical’’ processes. 5.1 Direct Membrane Passage (Protein Transduction) A natural structure showing direct protein transduction is found in a class of peptides called protein transduction domains (PTD). PTDs are subunits of proteins that naturally transduce cells, i.e., the TAT protein of human immu- nodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) [66], the PTD of VP22, a structural protein of the herpes simplex virus [67], or the antennapedia domain of a Drosophila protein [68]. The transport of peptides and proteins bearing such peptides was reportedtobeanenergy- andtemperature-independent process, which led to the theory that such PTDs enable delivery directly into the cell by mem- brane penetration. Schwarze et al. showed that a protein linked to the TAT domain resulted in cellular delivery in almost all tissues in vivo [69]. Proposing a direct membrane passage of such proteins led to discussions within the scientific community concerning the possibility of artifacts, especially in the case of TAT [70]. It is now a mostly accepted view that cationic PTDs bind the cell surface by electrostatic interaction and are subsequently internalized by lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis in a temperature- and energy- dependent manner [71]. However, when utilizing cationic amphipathic sequences noncovalently attached to cargo proteins, a direct membrane tran- sition is still discussed [72]. 5.2 Endosomal Release After endocytosis and acidification of endosomes by ATP-dependent proton pumps and fusion with lysosomes, proteins are prone to proteolytic degrada- tion. Hence, release from the endosome into the cytoplasm is still a major bottleneck in the delivery of macromolecular drugs including proteins. Viruses have developed mechanisms to escape the endosome utilizing microenviron- mental changes, for example, influenza virus: the N-terminus of hemagglutinin exhibits a random coil structure at physiological pH, whereas after acidification to pH 5, acidic amino acid residues become protonated and form a membrane- lytic helical structure [65]. Different approaches have been made in the field of macromolecular drug delivery mimicking such processes: cointernalizing mem- brane-active peptides with cationized ribonucleases efficiently assisted in endo- somal release of the protein delivered [37]. Another approach is to chemically modify the peptide side chain with pH-sensing molecules; such peptide deriva- tives are not membrane lytic at neutral pH but regain full lytic activity after 280 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris endosomal acidification and cleavage of the pH-sensing modification [73, 74]. Several polymers suitable for delivery of proteins bear intrinsic endosomolytic properties. Polyethylenimine (PEI), an organic molecule with the highest den- sity of protonable amines, has so far mostly been used for delivery of nucleic acids into cells [75]. Branched PEI bears a mixture of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines with only a fraction of them being protonated at neutral pH. When PEI is internalized into endosomes, protons pumped into the endosome by ATP-dependent proton pumps are absorbed by PEI, leading to swelling of the polymer and further protonation of amino groups. This proton-buffering effect in turn leads to influx of chloride counter ions, the osmotic imbalance leads to diffusion of water into the endosome, leading to osmotic pressure and subsequent lysis of the endosome [76]. This makes PEI and other polyamines suitable candidates for efficient protein delivery. 6 Protein/Peptide Therapeutics A broad range of biologically active peptides and proteins exist being poten- tially suitable for targeted tumor therapies. In the following section a selection of peptides and proteins are described, including their natural biological func- tion, antitumoral activity, and application in tumor targeting. 6.1 Membrane-Lytic Peptides Membrane-lytic peptides are natural defense molecules expressed in different species including insects, invertebrates, and vertebrates. In humans they are part of the innate immune system (for review, see [77, 78]). Due to their membrane-lytic activity they have been initially utilized as antimicrobial agents, but they also have the potential to act as cytotoxic agents in tumor therapy [79]. The mechanism of their action is often based on their cationic and amphipathic nature, which allows efficient cell binding and/or membrane lysis (see also Sections 4.1 and 5.1). After charge-mediated membrane binding, the amphi- pathic part of the peptide interacts with the cell membrane, which leads to insertion into the bilayer and subsequent membrane lysis. Targeting them to tumor tissue is vital to prevent side effects on healthy tissue. Being macromolecular drugs they are less prone to become inactive due to resistance mechanisms based on the upregulation of efflux pumps [80], a major resistance mechanism in tumor cells against low molecular drugs [81, 82]. The luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LH/CR) is expressed in ovaries, testis, and the uterus but also upregulated in different tumors, making it a suitable candidate for targeted tumor therapies [83]. Melittin is a cationic, 25-amino- acid peptide found in bee venom that causes membrane lysis [84]. To achieve targeting of a melittin derivative to cancer cells, a peptide sequence targeting the Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 281 luteinizing hormone receptor was attached [85]. After multiple administrations of the construct via the bloodstream, even tumor metastases could be selectively destroyed. Similar approaches targeting LH/CR that is overexpressed in hepa- tocellular carcinoma [86], prostate [87], and gastric carcinoma [88] led to clear antitumoral activity on murine xenograft models. Rege and colleagues attached a monoclonal antibody targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) to a cationic peptide sequence and achieved two orders of magnitude higher cell killing in vitro compared to the nontargeted peptide [89]. 6.2 Peptides Influencing Intracellular Functions of Tumor Cells Tumor cells are also characterized by deregulated cellular pathways in signal transduction and growth regulation leading to proliferation, metastasis, and invasion. Peptide sequences can be utilized to specifically interfere with these pathways by binding to proteins, thus leading to their selective inactivation and subsequent induction of apoptosis or redifferentiation (for review, see [90]). The de novo designed basic peptide sequence KLAKLAK has been initially described for its antimicrobial function but exhibiting low toxicity toward mammalian cells [91]. When attaching a protein transduction domain to the peptide in order to promote its uptake into mammalian cells, apoptosis was observed after intratumoral injection of the conjugate into murine sarcoma tumors [92]. In another case, intratumoral application of KLAKLAK peptide attached to an integrin-targeted RGD sequence led to reduced tumor growth in a murine melanoma tumor model [93]. 6.3 Ribosome-Inactivating Proteins (RIP) Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) belong to the superfamily of N- glycosidases and are mainly found in plants, fungi, and bacteria (for review, see [94]). RIPs are able to irreversibly damage ribosomes [95]: the N-glycosidic activity leads to removal of a highly conserved adenine residue from 28S rRNA. This alteration blocks its GTPase activities involved in the binding of elonga- tion factor-2 (EF-2); due to loss of EF-2, binding translation is inhibited. RIPs can be separated into three main classes: Type 1 RIPs consist of a single, basic peptide chain of approximately 30 kDa having in common that they share highly conserved residues as well as the secondary structure within their active side [96]. Type 2 RIPs consist of two chains: the enzymatically active A chain (comparable to type 1 RIPs) and a B chain (\u000435 kDa), which exhibits a lectin structure. The latter binds to galactosyl moieties like glycoproteins or glycoli- pids that can be found on the surface of most eukaryotic cells [97]. Binding to the cell surface triggers endocytosis and transport into the cytoplasm, where the A chain can unfold its enzymatic activity. Type 3 RIPs represent the smallest group, which are translated as precursor molecules and have to be processed by proteases to gain full activity [98, 99]. 282 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris Gelonin, a single-chain type I RIP, is virtually nontoxic toward mammalian cells, as it lacks an internalization function [100]. When chemically coupling gelonin to transferrin or an anti-TfR antibody, Yazdi and colleagues observed potent cell killing or TfR overexpressing tumor cells [101]. Hsu and colleagues applied a fusion toxin consisting of gelonin and a VEGF isoform binding to the VEGF receptor [102]. Tumor proliferation was significantly decreased and histological studies revealed that the tumor endothelium was damaged due to the targeted treatment with gelonin. The type I RIP saporin (first isolated from the plant Saponaria officinalis) expressed as a fusion protein with EGF led to specific antitumoral activity on EGF receptor-overexpressing tumors [55]. Coupling folate to saporin via carbohydrate residues allowed targeted delivery into FR-overexpressing tumor cells [103]. The high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) is expressed on most melanoma tissues, whereas it cannot be found in normal tissues or other tumors. Coupling of an HMW-MAA-specific antibody to gelonin specifically inhibited protein synthesis in melanoma cells [104]. Ricin, a type II RIP found in the bean of the castor plant, has been exten- sively used for targeted tumor therapies: replacing the lectin B chain, which binds to almost all mammalian cells, with peptides, antibodies, or proteins targeting cancer cells leads to selective target toxicity [105]. Several clinical trials by this approach have been conducted (see Section 7). 6.4 Ribonucleases Ribonucleases are regulating the RNA half-life in the cytoplasm and hence leading to posttranscriptional control of gene expression. Several toxins found in plants and animals show ribonuclease activity and are evaluated for tumor- targeted therapies [106]. Ranpirnase (Onconase) is a secreted ribonuclease iso- lated from Rana pipiens and belongs to the pancreatic RNAse A superfamily of ribonucleases [107]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown its cytotoxic and antiproliferative anticancer activity: due to degradation of tRNA, which in turn interferes with protein production, apoptotic cell death occurs. Meanwhile ranpirnase is already applied in several clinical trials including a phase III trial for unresectable mesothelioma [108]. Ranpirnase covalently linked to an anti- CD22 antibody showed promising activity against Daudi Burkitt lymphoma both in vitro and in a xenograft model in SCID mice [109]. To achieve targeted delivery, Rybak and colleagues coupled bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A to a TfR-directed, single-chain antibody (scFv) [110]. The rationale of utilizing a mammalian ribonuclease was to reduce the immunogenicity of the conjugate. In humans the ribonuclease eosinophil-derived neurotoxin is found in cytotoxic granules of eosinophils but also in liver tissue and plays an important role in the defense against viral infections [111]. When expressing eosinophil-derived neu- rotoxin as a fusion protein with a TfR-directed scFv, specific cell killing was Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 283 observed in leukemia cells, whereas TfR-negative cells were not affected [112]. In a similar way, Menzel and colleagues used an scFv directed against CD30- positive lymphoma cells [113]. 6.5 Bacterial Toxins Bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin (DT), Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE), and Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) are potential candidates for selective tumor cell killing [114]. Both DT from Corynebacterium diphtheriae and PE from Pseudomonas aeruginosa irreversibly inhibit protein synthesis by catalyzing the ADP ribosylation of EF-2 leading to cell lysis or apoptosis; CPE is a pore forming toxin, leading directly to rapid cell lysis [115]. DT is a single-chain protein consisting of three domains: the B domain binds to heparin-binding epidermal growth factor receptor, which leads to endocytosis. After internalization into clathrin-coated vesicles, DT is cleaved by the endo- somal enzyme furin, and the lowered endosomal pH induces conformational changes, which lead to insertion of the translocation domain into the endo- somal membrane. After reductive cleavage of an intramolecular disulfide bridge, the catalytic domain A is unfolded and translates the toxin to the cytoplasm. By replacing the cell-binding B domain with tumor-specific ligands, DT can be specifically directed to tumor tissue. Replacing the B domain with human EGF, specific toxicity was observed in EGFR-overex- pressing tumors [116]. Covalent attachment of transferrin to DT containing a mutated, inactive B domain redirected the conjugate to TfR-overexpressing cells and showed effective killing of glioblastoma tumors after intratumoral injection of the conjugate in an orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice [117]. The conjugate, termed Tf-CRM 107, was also tested later in clinical trials (see Section 7). Similar to DT, Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is a single- chain peptide with three domains for binding the cellular PE receptor (domain 1), the translocation across membranes (domain 2), and the ADP ribosylating activity (domain 3). When PE with truncated domain 1 fused to a TfR- binding antibody, the fusion protein showed selective killing of TfR-over- expressing tumor cells after systemic injection in a metastatic colon carcinoma tumor model, whereas no effect was found with the nontargeted truncated PE [118]. More recently, PE fusion proteins with the cytokine IL-13 as targeting moiety were used for treating IL-13 receptor-positive xenografted human tumors in nude mice, leading to eradication of head and neck cancer [119], renal cell carcinoma, and glioma [120]. The PE–IL-13 fusion protein is cur- rently evaluated in clinical trials (Section 7). 6.6 Therapeutic Antibodies Besides being used for site-specific delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, pep- tides, proteins, or radionuclides in cancer therapy, monoclonal antibodies have 284 C. Dohmen and M. Ogris been generated to interfere with the tumor cells’ metabolism, leading to growth arrest, apoptosis, or inhibition of invasion and metastasis. Several therapeutic antibodies have been developed to interfere with the signaling involved in the overexpression of members of the EGFR family. Cetuximab (C225) binds to EGFR (Her 1), blocks activation of receptor tyrosine kinase, and finally leads to cell cycle arrest [121]. A fully humanized version of an EGFR-binding anti- body has been shown to be effective in the treatment of metastasized colon carcinoma [122]. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a fully humanized antibody bind- ing to the extracellular domain of the tyrosine kinase receptor Her 2 and is already applied clinically for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma (for review, see [123]). A proposed mechanism of action is the reduction of Her 2 signaling, leading to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, but also the downregulation of Her 2/neu, and reduction in neoangiogenesis is discussed. Besides Her 1 and Her 2, also aberrant Her 3 signaling is thought to be involved in malignant growth of tumors. For this purpose, Robinson and colleagues developed a bispecific single-chain Fv antibody, which targets both ErbB2 and ErbB3 [124]. The antibody selectively homed to subcutaneously implanted ErbB2- and ErbB3-expressing tumors and led to concomitant cell cycle arrest and reduced tumor growth. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3) are the key regulators leading to the development of a functional circulation system (vasculogenesis) during embryonic development and to the formation of tumor blood vessels from existing blood vessels (angio- genesis) [125]. VEGFR activities are regulated by their natural ligands (VEGF (VEGF-A), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D), which leads to angiogenesis. Inter- fering with this pathway offers the possibility to cut off the blood supply of solid tumors by downregulation of tumor angiogenesis [126]. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a clinically approved, fully humanized monoclonal antibody binding and neutralizing VEGF [127]. The antibody is approved for a broad range of solid cancers and often used in conjunction with classical chemotherapeutic agents like paclitaxel in breast cancer [128]. Monoclonal antibodies have also been developed for the treatment of leukemia: the leukocyte marker CD20 is expressed during B-cell development and its expression disappears during terminal differentiation [129]. In non- Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, CD20 is upregulated and thus a valid tumor marker [130]. The monoclonal antibody rituximab, which binds to CD20, has been approved by FDA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and rheuma- toid arthritis. After binding to CD20-positive cells, the exposed distal Fc part of the antibody leads to subsequent complement activation, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, activation of natural killer cells, and finally cell lysis [131]. Recently, multivalent CD20 antibodies have been developed that com- prise six binding sites for the antigen and one Fc part [132]. Such multivalent antibodies will cause clustering of several CD20 molecules on the cell surface, thus leading to inhibition of cell growth. Receptor-Mediated Delivery of Proteins and Peptides to Tumors 285 7 Clinical Applications and Challenges of Protein and Peptide Therapeutics Several targeted peptide- and protein-based therapies have been in clinical trials or approved in the clinic (for a summary of targeted toxins, see Table 1). Targeted toxins (diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin) have been mostly applied locally in recurrent glioblastoma. As glioblastoma does not metastasize to other organs except within the brain, localized therapies for glioblastomas are promising. Therapy using DT targeting to the TfR (Tf-CRM107, Trans- MID) has been successfully applied in clinical phase II trial and is now in a phase III trial [133]. TP-38 is a fusion protein consisting of PE with a truncated cell-binding domain and transforming growth factor-a (TGF-a), which is related to EGF and also binds to EGFR [134]. No adverse systemic side effects were observed after intracranial application, and a partial response was observed in 2 out of 15 patients. Efficiency was limited due to inefficient distribution of the toxin within the brain [135]. Gliomas overexpressing inter- leukin-13 receptor were treated with a PE–IL-13 fusion protein by intracranial infusion in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation [136]. The treatment was well tolerated and further clinical testing is planned. NBI-3001 (PE coupled to IL-4) was systemically applied in patients with IL-4 receptor-positive renal cell and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma [137]. Among 14 patients who received a total of 36 cycles of treatment, dose limiting toxicity and high levels of neutra- lizing antibodies were observed, whereas tumor growth was not significantly affected. ONTAK (denileukin diftitox), a DT fusion protein with IL-2 approved by FDA in 1999 for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma, was success- fully applied in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [138]. Like for all anticancer agents, the major limitations in their use are toxicity, or unwanted side effects, and the development of resistance mechanism. Pro- teins and peptides are potential immunogens, especially when derived from different species. Hence, repeated systemic application can lead to the induction of humoral immune response, which leads to either inactivation of the drug or even severe side effects. Strategies to overcome these limitations include: (1) simple localized application: in the case of glioblastoma, which does not metastasize outside the brain, this strategy can lead to a positive clinical out- come. In case systemic application is necessary, the protein or the peptide can be modified to be less immunogenic. (2) Covalent attachment of PEG decreases immunogenicity, and in case of synthetic peptides replacing L-amino acids with their D-enantiomers, antigen processing and immunogenic responses can be prevented. (3) Also decreasing the peptide length has been shown to reduce immunogenicity at least in a murine model [145]. Patients receiving toxins have developed antibodies with epitopes directed against the toxin [146]. Vascular leak syndrome (VLS) leads to decreased albumin blood levels, accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space, endema, and in severe cases to fluid accumulation in lung. Therefore, the appearance of VLS limits the dose being applied for most 286 C. Dohmen and M.

Pretreatment with immunosuppressive drugs showed success in rodent models, but failed in primates [148]. The use of humanized peptide sequences, i.e., utilizing human versions of toxins or huma- nized antibodies, has been shown to be successful in preventing the induction of neutralizing antibodies [149]. Nevertheless, immunogenicity of targeted toxins can also be beneficial for tumor therapy, as they can act as potent inducers of antitumor immunity [150]. Therapeutic antibodies face similar problems, i.e., the induction of so-called idiotype–anti-idiotype interactions [151]. Even when having a fully humanized sequence, antibodies can be induced binding to the paratope of the therapeutic antibody applied. When applying therapeutic anti- body blocking, e.g., certain signaling pathways, a resistance mechanism also observed with other chemotherapeutic utilizing alternative signaling pathways can occur [152]. Combination therapies or simultaneous targeting of more than one pathway has the potential to overcome these shortcomings. 8 Conclusions and Future Directions Targeted delivery of proteins and peptides to tumors is a very promising field for the treatment of cancer and several formulations have already been approved as drugs in cancer therapy. Their high molecular weight, which circumvents the appearance of resistance mechanisms based on elevated efflux of low molecular drugs, also limits antitumoral activity due to limited diffu- sion within tumor tissue. Novel technologies enabling the screening of short peptide sequences for receptor binding or intracellular target interaction (for example, peptide aptamers) will help to overcome such shortcomings and lead to the development of peptide drugs with elevated levels of specificity and efficiency. Delivery technologies based on chemical modification or formula- tion of peptides will further help to overcome current shortcomings. A major drawback of systemically applied therapeutic proteins is their potential immu- nogenicity, especially in the case of repeated systemic dosing, and such immu- nogenic responses were often dose-limiting side effects in several clinical trials (see Section 7). Increasing the specificity will allow to decrease the dose applied to achieve a clinically relevant effect and direct modification of the protein, e.g., by PEGylation or changes in the protein structure, will further help to reduce immunogenic reactions. Direct modification of the protein/ peptide drug is the development of fully humanized antibodies and stability- optimized proteins and peptides containing nonproteogenic amino acids. Novel techniques, such as specific knockdown of protein expression by small interfering RNA or different protein–protein interaction techniques, will help to gain more knowledge about tumor development and lead to new approaches for cancer treatment. 288 C.

Both genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations have been associated with cancer [1]. The former include deletions, point mutations, or amplification of genes, chromo- somal translocations, and gain or loss of entire chromosomes. The latter are modifications of genomic DNA, such as methylation and acetylation. All of these alterations lead to a gain of function of oncogenes or loss of function of tumor suppressor genes and have been recognized as effective targets for cancer therapy. Not only small chemicals but also various high-molecular weight biomacromolecules, such as oligonucleotides, antisense nucleotides, antisense peptide nucleic acids, small interference RNA, DNA (cDNA), peptides, pro- teins, and antibodies, have proven useful for regulating the function of these target genes. However, the plasma membrane of the cell surface forms an effective barrier and limits the internalization of such macromolecules into cells; therefore, the application of these information-rich macromolecules to cancer therapy has long been restricted. Although various methods to inter- nalize macromolecules into living cells in vivo have been proposed, most of them resulted in inefficient delivery. Additionally, other problems such as complex manipulation, toxicity, and immunogenicity have prevented the rou- tine therapeutic use of macromolecules. Over the past decade, the unique activity of oligopeptides, known as protein transduction domains (PTDs) or cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), has made it possible to transduce biologically active macromolecules into living cells [2, 3]. It was accomplished by conjugating a PTD to the desired macromolecule. Various kinds of macromolecules have been successfully internalized into living H.

Moreover, several groups have already applied this strategy in vivo and confirmed anticancer activity in preclinical experiments using tumor-bearing animals [4–17]. In this chapter, we focus on recent progress in PTD-mediated anticancer strategies. In addition, we review the characteristics of PTD polypeptides, mechanism of PTD-mediated internalization, problems and perspectives of PTD-mediated anticancer strategies, and history of this research field. 2 PTD as a Transducer of Macromolecules into Living Cells In 1988, two groups, Green and Loewenstein, and Frankel and Pabo, indepen- dently reported that the transcriptional activator of transcription (Tat) protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has the unique potential to enter cultured cells (Table 1) [18, 19]. Green and Loewenstein found that a chemically synthesized partial Tat protein (first 86 amino acids of the protein) entered HeLa cells when added to the culture medium and transactivated the expression of a Tat-responsive reporter gene pretransfected in the cells. Frankel and Pabo also demonstrated that the addition of a recombinant Tat protein to the culture medium was sufficient to induce the expression of a HIV-1 LTR-dependent reporter gene which was pretransfected in HeLa cells. Although the physiolo- gical importance of this internalization still remains to be elucidated, the reports marked an important first milestone in the development of a PTD-mediated anticancer strategy. In 1994, Fawell et al. marked a second milestone, that the Tat protein can mediate the internalization of a heterologous protein into cells by chemical conjugation (Table 1) [20]. They chemically cross-linked Tat peptides (residues 1–72 or 37–72) to b-galactosidase, horseradish peroxidase, RNase A, and domain III of pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and monitored their uptake. Interestingly, all the cells in the culture dish were transduced with the Tat protein. In addition, the internalization was achieved in all cell types tested, such as HeLa, COS-1, CHO, H9, NIH3T3, primary human keratinocytes, and Table 1 Milestones for the development of PTD-mediated delivery of bioactive protein in vivo Year Finding References 1988 Internalization of chemically synthesized partial Tat protein (first 86 a.a.) into living cells and its bioactivity 18 Internalization of recombinant Tat protein into living cells and its bioactivity 19 1994 Tat-mediated internalization of heterologous protein into living cells 20 Identification of the ‘‘tat protein transduction domain’’ 1999 Tat-mediated delivery of biologically active protein in vivo 39 298 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka umbilical endothelial cells. The domain responsible for this translocation was identified in the short basic region (47–57 of the Tat protein) and termed the ‘‘Tat protein transduction domain (PTD)’’ [21–23]. Subsequent studies have further demonstrated that Tat-PTD facilitates the internalization of conjugated proteins into living cells in vitro [24]. Likewise, a number of other cationic peptides, e.g., a peptide from the third a–helix of the antennapedia home- odomain [25–28], and a peptide from the VP22 protein from the herpes simplex virus [29] have been reported as PTDs showing the same attractive activity as Tat-PTD [30]. Using these PTDs, various physiologically and therapeutically active macromolecules, such as peptides, proteins [20], antisense peptide nucleic acid [31, 32], DNA [33], super magnet beads [34], liposomes [35], l phages [36], and antibodies [37] have been successfully transduced into living cells. The intracellular delivery of these macromolecules modulates the functions of var- ious genes [30] related to the cell cycle [22] and apoptosis [38] in vitro. Moreover, in 1999, Schwarze et al. demonstrated that the intraperitoneal injection of a Tat- PTD-fused 120 kDa b-galactosidase (b-Gal) protein resulted in the delivery of the biologically active fusion protein to all tissues in mice, including the brain (Table 1) [39]. Their results revealed new possibilities for the direct delivery of macromolecules into patients. 3 Characteristics and Categories of PTD Peptides capable of delivering macromolecules into living cells can be categorized as either ‘‘protein derived’’ or ‘‘designed’’ (Table 2) [40, 41]. Protein-derived peptides are short polypeptides encoded in natural proteins of various organisms and responsible for the penetration of proteins into cells. Tat-PTD derived from the HIV-1 Tat protein [23], penetratin from the homeodomain of Drosophila Antennapedia [28], pVEC from murine vascular endothelial cadherin [42], and signal sequence-based peptides from various cytokines [43] are categorized in this group. All the protein-derived PTDs share a ‘‘positive charge’’ caused by basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine residues. Such information has helped to the development of several potent synthetic peptides such as polyarginine and polylysine, which show potential for penetration [44].

It is widely accepted that electro- static interaction of positively charged PTD with negatively charged cellular membrane is followed by three energy- and temperature-dependent processes, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, lipid raft-mediated caveolae endocytosis, or macropinocytosis (Fig. 1). Clathrin- mediated endocytosis Clathrin- mediated endocytosis Caveolae- mediated endocytosis Caveolae- mediated endocytosis MacropinocytosisMacropinocytosis Clathrin-coated vesicle Clathrin-coated vesicle CaveosomeCaveosome MacropinosomeMacropinosome Sorting EndosomeSorting Endosome Nucleus Late Endosome Recycling Endosome proteoglycansproteoglycans clathrin caveolin PTD-Macromolecule proteoglycans Actin Rearrangement Actin Rearrangement Fig. 1 Proposed model for the internalization of PTD-conjugated macromolecules into cells. Interaction of positively charged PTDs with negatively charged proteoglycans and glycosa- minoglycans plays an important role in the internalization. The electrostatic interaction is followed by energy- and temperature-dependent endocytotic pathways. This involves phago- cytotic and pinocytotic pathways: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocy- tosis, and macropinocytosis 300 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka Early on, it was reported that the internalization of Tat protein occurred even at 48C [23], and similar observations were reported for the basic amino acid-rich peptide derived from the antennapedia homeodomain [47]. Therefore, it had been widely assumed that the PTD-mediated internalization occurs in an energy- and receptor-independent manner and is alternatively based on direct transport through the lipid bilayer. However, it has been reported that the energy independence and receptor independence resulted from experimental artifacts in the process of cell fixation prior to microscopic observation and also were due to the inadequate removal of PTD conjugates bound to the cell surface [48, 49]. Moreover, it has been reported that the internalization is almost completely suppressed at 48C in unfixed conditions [49, 50]. All of these recent results, together with the observation that heparan sulfate and an inhibitor of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein precluded the cellular uptake of PTD peptides and PTD-fused macromolecules [50, 51], suggest that the interaction of positively charged PTDs with negatively charged cell surface constituents, such as proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans (heparan sulfate, heparin), plays an important role in the internalization (Fig. 1) [51–54]. Also, the electrostatic interaction is followed by the three energy- and temperature- dependent processes [48]. A characteristic of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the formation of clathrin- coated membrane pits that pinch off the cellular membrane to generate vesicles [49]. The involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the internalization of PTDs was suggested by the finding that an FITC-labeled avidin–Tat-PTD com- plex colocalized with transferrin, a classical endocytic marker [55]. The impor- tance of the classical endocytotic pathway and the temperature sensitivity of PTD internalization was confirmed further [48]. A typical feature of caveola-mediated endocytosis is the formation of non- coated invaginations composed of detergent-resistant membrane components rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, known as lipid rafts [56]. The importance of the caveola-mediated mechanism in the PTD-mediated internalization was confirmed in an experiment where the cellular uptake of Tat peptide was affected by drugs that either disrupt lipid rafts or alter caveolar trafficking [57]. Moreover, Tat-PTD-fused protein showed colocalization with a marker of caveolar uptake, caveolin, further strengthening the importance of the mechan- ism in the PTD-mediated internalization [57]. The importance of macropinocytosis in the PTD-mediated internalization of macromolecules was reported recently [58, 59]. Macropinocytosis defines a series of sequential events: (1) a dramatic reorganization and ruffling of the plasma membrane by actin filaments, (2) the formation of an external macro- pinocytic structure, and (3) the inclusion and internalization of large vesicles, known as macropinosomes, into the cytoplasm [60]. Using a permeable Tat-Cre recombinase reporter and living cells, Wadia et al. demonstrated that Tat- fusion proteins are rapidly internalized by the macropinocytic pathway after the initial ionic cell–surface interaction, confirming the importance of macro- pinocytosis for the internalization of macromolecules [58]. PTD-Mediated Delivery of Anticancer Proteins 301 It is generally accepted that the mechanism responsible for the internaliza- tion depends on the size of the PTD conjugate. Namely, the macropinocytic pathway seems to be responsible for the internalization of macromolecules. In addition, caveolae-mediated pathway has also been reported to play an impor- tant role in it [57]. On the other hand, the caveolae-mediated or clathrin- mediated endocytic pathways seem to function in the internalization of PTD itself or PTD-conjugated small molecules. 5 Kinetics and Tissue Distribution of PTD-Fused Protein in Living Animals Kinetics and tissue distribution of PTD-fused protein drugs in vivo are impor- tant information for the development of novel PTD-mediated anticancer ther- apeutics and for the optimization of therapeutic regimens. Schwarze et al. demonstrated that biologically active proteins could be delivered to many tissues including the liver, kidney, heart, muscle, lung, spleen, and brain of mice after intraperitoneal injection of 200–500 mg of Tat–b-Gal fusion protein [39]. Polyakov et al. reported a preliminary but important information that intravenous injection of Tat-PTD labeled with Technetium-99m ( 99mTc) showed a rapid distribution to whole body [61]. The level of Tat-99mTc in organs reached peak within 5 min after injection and showed modestly rapid blood clearance. The Tat-99mTc was rapidly cleared by both renal and hepatobiliary excretion over the subsequent 2 h with activity appearing in the urinary and bladder and bowel. In addition, Cai et al. analyzed in detail when Tat–b-Gal fusion protein is distributed in different organs, such as liver, kidney, spleen, lung, bowel, and brain, through four different routes, such as portal vein, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and oral administration [62]. Tissues were har- vested 15 min, 1 h, 6 h, 10 h, and 24 h after the administration and subjected to enzymatic activity assay. b-Gal activity peaked at 15 min in most tissues after portal vein, intravenous, and intraperitoneal administration and at 1 h after oral dosing in all tissues (Fig. 2). b-Gal activity in the liver at 15 min after portal vein injection was higher than after intravenous, intraperitoneal, and oral dosing. The median initial half-life for activity was 2.2 h, ranging from 1.2 h to 3.4 h (Table 3). All of these pharmacokinetic data allow rational optimiza- tion of delivery route and schedules for therapeutic PTD-fused proteins. 6 Development of PTD-Mediated Anticancer Protein Drugs Research on protein transduction has dramatically expanded from in vitro to in vivo in the last decade. The advantage of this application is that one can accomplish the rapid and equal distribution of PTD-conjugated macromole- cules to all tissues and cells in vivo [39]. However, as medications, PTD-fused 302 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka anticancer macromolecules should have target specificity and act locally; other- wise damage to normal tissues and side effects may occur. In the following sections, we focus on the use of PTDs to develop anticancer macromolecules and introduce several representative strategies to distinguish between tumors and normal tissues to increase specificity but decrease side effects (Table 4).

These phenomena conse- quently cause hypoxic areas in solid tumors, to which the supply of oxygen from tumor capillaries is inadequate [63, 64]. Hypoxia has been recognized as a tumor-specific microenvironment; in other words, healthy adults probably have few hypoxic tissues. Under hypoxic conditions, a transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), induces the expression of various genes Table 4 PTD-mediated anticancer strategies Cargo Effect PTD References ODD-procaspase3 Tumor growth delay, radiosensitization Tat 4–6, 78 p53 C-terminal region (p53C) p53-dependent apoptosis pAntp 7 p53C 0 (modified p53C) Tumor growth delay, 6 times extension in lifespan Tat 8 p53 N-terminal region (p53N) Activation of apoptotic genes, cytotoxicity for cancer cells, regression of human retinoblastoma cells in a rabbit eye Tat 9 SmacN7 Enhancement of TRAIL in a tumor xenograft Tat 10 SmacN7 Reversion of apoptosis resistance, synergistic effect with a chemotherapy R8 11 Surv–T34A (Survivin T34A) DNA fragmentation, aberrant nuclei formation, tumor cell apoptosis, tumor growth delay, 40–50% reduction in tumor mass Tat 12 BH3 domain of Bak Apoptosis of cancer cells pAntp 13 BH3 domain of Bim Apoptosis of cancer cells, tumor growth delay Tat 14 VHL104-123 Inhibition of thymidine incorporation into RCC cells, inhibition of MAP kinase pathway, inhibition of RCC proliferation in vitro, growth delay of RCC xenografts, regression of tumor volume, inhibition of invasion of RCC tumor Tat 15 ESX Reduction in ErbB2 protein level, induction of apoptosis retardation of growth of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, Tat 16 Tumor-associated antigen: OVA Antigen presentation to CD4 T-cells, tumor regression in mice Tat 17 304 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka related to angiogenesis [65] and glycolysis [66] and leads to invasive and meta- static properties of tumor cells [67]. Moreover, HIF-1 activity is associated with the resistance of tumor cells to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy [68, 69] and with patient mortality in clinical studies [70–72]. Therefore, exten- sive efforts have been devoted to the development of novel therapies, which specifically damage hypoxic/HIF-1-activating tumor cells [69, 73]. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of an alpha subunit (HIF-1a) and a constitutively expressed beta subunit (HIF-1b) [74]. HIF-1 activity is mainly dependent on the level of HIF-1a protein [74, 75]. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1a interacts with HIF-1b and functions as a transcrip- tion factor. Under normoxic conditions, the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1a is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and ubiquitinated by the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein- containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in rapid degradation of the HIF-1a protein [76, 77]. We took advantage of this unique property of the ODD domain to develop a novel hypoxia-targeting protein drug [4–6, 78]. First of all, we identified the minimum region of the ODD domain responsible for the oxygen-dependent degradation of arbitrary proteins fused to it [4]. We confirmed the hypoxia- dependent b-Gal and luciferase activity of ODD–b-Gal fusion protein [4] and ODD–luciferase fusion protein [79], respectively, in cultured cells. To apply the ODD-fusion protein to an in vivo study, we fused Tat-PTD to the N-terminal of the ODD–b-Gal protein and created a Tat–ODD–b-Gal triple-fusion pro- tein [4]. After i.p. injection with the Tat–ODD–b-Gal fusion protein into subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice, b-Gal activity was detected only in the hypoxic regions of the solid tumor, not in normal tissue [4]. These results demonstrate that biologically active proteins can be exogenously delivered to hypoxic tumor cells by the Tat–ODD peptide in vivo. This was the first example of the target specificity of Tat-mediated protein delivery. To examine whether the Tat–ODD fusion protein with cytotoxicity shows a hypoxia- targeting effect, the Tat–ODD peptide was fused to a proapoptotic protein [4–6, 78]. We intentionally chose a precursor of caspase-3, procaspase-3, because it is activated in response to hypoxic stress, which was thought to reduce the possibility of side effects in the well-oxygenated normal tissues (Fig. 3A) [4, 78]. Systemic administration with the resultant fusion protein, Tat–ODD–procaspase-3 (TOP3), dramatically induced apoptosis of tumor cells in the border area between well-oxygenated viable cells and necrotic cells (Fig. 3B) [5]. TOP3 reduced volume of hypoxic tumor cells and entire tumor itself, as well as suppressed tumor growth without any obvious side effects (Fig. 3C) [4–6]. The hypoxia-targeting effect of TOP3 was proven using a rat ascites model, in which the intraperitoneal injection of MM1 cells results in highly hypoxic ascetic fluid [80]. Inoue et al. demonstrated that the intraper- itoneal injection of TOP3 resulted in a significant increase in the lifespan of rats with malignant ascites, and furthermore, 60% of the treated animals were cured without the recurrence of ascites. PTD-Mediated Delivery of Anticancer Proteins 305 6.2 Restoration and Activation of p53 Function Genetic alterations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes cause deregu- lated proliferation and the evasion of apoptosis and consequently make cells more malignant [1]. In the development of novel cancer therapy strategies, extensive efforts have been devoted to restoring the lesions preventing the implementation of the apoptotic response and leading to the death of malignant Relative Hypoxia(Relative HIF-1 Activity) CB A Fig. 3 TOP3 specifically targets HIF-1-active (hypoxic) tumor cells. (A) PTD facilitates internalization of TOP3 into tumor cells. In normoxic tumor cells, TOP3 is hydroxylated and ubiquitinated through the same regulation as HIF-1a protein, and resultantly degraded by 26S proteasome. Meanwhile, in hypoxic tumor cells, TOP3 is activated and induces apoptosis. See Ref. [78] for details. (B) TOP3 increased TUNNEL-positive apoptotic cells in border area between normoxic and necrotic areas. See Ref. [5] for details. (C) TOP3 significantly reduces HIF-1-positive (hypoxic) tumor cells. See Ref. [6] for details. This figure was modified from Ref. [5, 6, 78] 306 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka cells. Such treatments are expected to be much less toxic to normal tissue than the conventional genotoxic agents currently in clinical use. The gene encoding the tumor suppressor p53 is the most common antiapop- totic lesion in cancer cells [81], and more than 50% of human cancers have been reported to harbor p53 gene mutations. In most remaining cases, p53 activity is impaired by alternative molecular mechanisms, such as an elevated level of a p53 inhibitor, Mdm2 [82], and the E6 protein of HPV [83], or silencing of a p53 coactivator, ARF [84, 85]. One of the most important functions of p53 is ‘‘cell cycle arrest,’’ in which p53 disturbs the replication of damaged genomic DNA and the fixation of mutations, allowing for DNA repair. Another important function is the ‘‘induction of apoptosis,’’ which occurs when the damage to the genomic DNA is too severe to be repaired. Both of these functions are essential for the regulation of cell proliferation in multicellular organisms [85], and their loss frequently leads to cellular neoplastic transformation and increases the resistance of cancer cells to anticancer therapies [86]. Therefore, restoring p53 function in tumor cells has been recognized as an effective way to induce cancer cell death in a large population of cancer patients. Gene therapy strategies with viral or nonviral vectors have been used to introduce a functional p53 gene into experimental tumor xenografts; however, the transfer efficacy did not meet our demands [87]. Additionally, a problem associated with immunogenicity was inevitable with this drug delivery system [88]. To overcome these difficulties, Tat-mediated approaches were carried out as follows. Selivanova et al. fused the Antennapedia transduction domain to a p53 C-terminal peptide (p53C), which was previously reported to activate the func- tion of both wt p53 and several mutant forms of p53, and it confirmed that the fusion protein induced p53-dependent apoptosis in several tumor cell lines [7]. On the other hand, the fusion protein had no apparent apoptosis-inducing effect on normal cells with a functional p53 gene. Snyder et al. then introduced a structural modification into the C-terminal to increase the stability of the protein, fused the resultant p53C’ to Tat-PTD, and introduced the fusion protein (Tat-p53C’) into tumor-bearing mice [8]. After an efficient delivery of Tat-p53C’ to all the cells in mice, the protein was activated in the tumor xenograft but not in normal tissue. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of the protein for 12 consecutive days caused a significant reduction in tumor growth and a 6-fold extension of lifespan. Harbour et al. reported another strategy targeting p53 lesion. They also aimed to restore endogenous p53 activitybyusing apermeable peptide [9]. HDM2 is known to decrease the ability of p53 to function as a positive transcription factor and facilitate proteolytic degradation of the protein through direct interaction with its N-terminal region [89]. Indeed, the over- expression of HDM2 has been reported in many clinically recognized tumors, which contain the wild-type p53 gene andis associatedwiththe functional inactivation of the p53 protein [90–92]. Therefore, the disruption of the inhibitory effect of HDM2 on p53 activity would be expected to yield therapeutic benefits in tumor cells that overexpress the HDM2 protein. Consequently, the N-terminal region of the p53 protein was fused to PTD-Mediated Delivery of Anticancer Proteins 307 Tat-PTD. The resultant Tat-p53N peptide induced the rapid accumulation of p53 and the activation of apoptotic genes, and it resulted in the prefer- ential killing of tumor cells and the regression of human retinoblastoma cells in rabbit eyes [9]. Minimal retinal damage was observed after intravitreal injection [9]. 6.3 Modification of Apoptotic Pathway A major obstacle in cancer therapy is the resistance of cancer cells to current anticancer treatments: chemotherapy and radiation therapy [93]. Defects in apop- totic programs, which are caused by deregulated expression and function of the components of the apoptotic pathway, contribute to such resistance [94, 95]. Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which inhibit caspase activity by directly binding to activated caspase-3 and -7, are frequently overexpresssed in malignant tumors [96]. The second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) is an important factor that is released from the mitochondria to the cytosol, antagonizes IAPs, and release caspases to promote apoptosis [97, 98]. Based on these mechanisms, one can expect the upregulation of Smac activity in tumor cells to improve resistance to anticancer therapies. Fulda et al. examined this hypothesis using a cell-permeable synthetic peptide composed of Tat-PTD and seven N-terminal amino acids of the Smac protein (AVPIAQK) [10]. The cell-permeable Smac polypeptide was expected to inactivate X-linked IAP (XIAP), disrupt the interaction of XIAP and caspase-9, and consequently induce apoptosis. The peptide enhanced the therapeutic effect of Apo2L/ tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in an intra- cranial malignant glioma xenograft model [10]. Moreover, the complete eradi- cation of established tumors was achieved only upon combined treatment with the Smac peptide and Apo2L/TRAIL. In these experiments, no detectable toxicity to normal brain tissue was observed. Yang et al. examined whether the inhibition of IAPs combined with chemotherapy produced synergistic effects [11]. First of all, they confirmed that the defect in apoptosome activity was dramatically restored by the same seven amino residues of Smac protein through the disruption of XIAP– caspase-9 interaction. On the other hand, SmacN7 peptide did not have any striking effect on the apoptosome activity of normal lung fibroblast cells. They further demonstrated that newly synthesized SmacN7 peptide fused to the cell membrane-permeable polyarginine (SmacN7R8) strongly reversed the resistance to apoptosis, and it displayed a synergistic effect with chemother- apyinvivo(Fig. 4). Because Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, is highly expressed in most tumors, it has been recognized as a promising therapeutic target in cancer [99]. A variety of Survivin antagonists have been reported to rescue the apoptotic pathway and induce apoptosis in 308 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka malignant cells; however, the utility of these agents has been limited by the inadequate delivery and permeability into tumor cells. To overcome these problems, Yan et al. generated a recombinant fusion protein composed of Tat-PTD and a dominant-negative mutant of Survivin, T34A mutant [12]. Tat–Surv–T34A induced cell detachment, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor in vitro. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of the fusion protein into subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice increased aberrant nuclei formation and tumor cell apoptosis, resulting in a 40–50% reduction in growth and mass of the tumor xenografts. A characteristic of the Bcl-2 family is the presence of one or more conserved Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-4) corresponding to four a-helical segments of Bcl-2 [100]. The Bcl-2 family is categorized into three groups: antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1), BH3-only proteins (Bim, Bid, Bad, PUMA), and BH1-3 multidomain proteins (Bax, Bak, Bok). The BH3-only proteins bind to the BH-4 domain of the antiapoptotic proteins, antagonize the function of these proteins, and consequently induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Applying this molecular mechanism, Holinger et al. fused the antennapedia PTD to the BH3 domain and successfully induced the apoptosis of HeLa cells [13]. Similarly, Kashiwagi et al. synthesized a polypeptide composed of Tat-PTD and the BH3 domain of Bim and confirmed that Tat–Bim induced apoptosis of T cell lymphoma (EL4), pancreatic cancer (Panc-2), and melanoma (B16) cells in a dose-dependent fashion [14]. Moreover, local injections of Tat–Bim twice a day for 7 days significantly delayed growth in murine models of pancreatic cancer and melanoma.

[11]; therefore, see Ref. [11] for details PTD-Mediated Delivery of Anticancer Proteins 309 6.4 Modification of IGF-I Signaling Pathway The growth of various kinds of cancer cells depends on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-mediated signaling; therefore, inhibiting this pathway has been recognized as a promising strategy. Indeed, direct inhibition of this pathway using a truncated form (dominant-negative form) of the IGF-I receptor (IGF- IR) [101], a specific IGF-IR antibody [102], or a specific IGF-IR antisense oligonucleotide [103] showed a significant therapeutic effect on various experi- mental tumor xenografts. In addition to such direct inhibition, an indirect method by transducing the functional VHL protein into cancer cells seems to be effective for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This idea is attributed to the fact that VHL is functionally inactivated in many RCCs [104], and the dysfunction accelerates the growth of RCC cells through the activation of the IGF-I- mediated signaling pathway [15, 105]. Datta et al. fused Tat-PTD to a specific amino acid sequence of the VHL b domain (VHL104-123), which binds to the cytoplasmic region of IGF-IR and inhibits IGF-I signaling, and examined the therapeutic effects on RCC [15]. The fusion protein, Tat–FLAG–VHL peptide, inhibited thymidine incorporation into RCC cells by nearly 80% compared with a counterpart protein (Tat–FLAG). Furthermore, the Tat–FLAG–VHL peptide inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase, an essential downstream molecule that leads to cell proliferation. Thus, these results suggest that Tat– FLAG–VHL peptide blocks IGF-I-induced proliferation of RCC cells in vitro. Furthermore, i.p. injections of Tat–FLAG–VHL peptide retarded the growth of subcutaneous RCC tumors, and in some cases, reduced the tumor volume, and dramatically inhibited invasiveness into the muscle layer. 6.5 Modification of ErbB2 (HER-2/neu) Expression The ErbB2 (HER-2/neu) gene is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family and is overexpressed in \u000230% of breast cancers [106, 107]. Deregulated expression of this gene is associated with lymph node metastasis and a poor prognosis [108, 109]. Therefore, the ErbB2 would serve as an excellent target for the development of novel cancer treatments. One of the critical transcription factors that activate the ErbB2 expression in breast cancer is ESX (ESE-1//ELF3/ERT/Jen) [110]. ESX interacts with DRIP130/ CRSP130/Sur-2, a Ras-linked metazoan-specific subunit of human mediator complexes, binds to the ESX-binding site in the ErbB2 promoter, and acti- vates the transcription of the ErbB2 gene [16]. Disruption of ESX–DRIP130 interactionis reportedtoimpair ErbB2 gene expression and reduce the pro- liferation and viability of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells [16]. Asada et al. identified the region essential for ESX–DRIP130 interaction and designed a cell-permeable form of ESX peptide using Tat-PTD [16]. The Tat–ESX peptide reduced the ErbB2 protein level, retarded cell growth, and 310 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka induced apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. The important point of their report is that cells with low ErbB2 protein levels were insensitive to the Tat–ESX peptide. 6.6 Application to Dendritic Cell (DC) Vaccines Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines are being developed to treat cancer, and clinical trials are ongoing [111, 112]. A primary goal of the strategy is to elicit responses from cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) that can kill tumor cells. In most cases, tumor antigen-derived peptides are loaded into DCs in vitro, and the cells are administered into patients. Expression of the defined tumor antigen in DCs can be achieved by transfecting the cells with cDNA encoding the tumor antigen or by infecting the cells with virus expressing the antigen; however, there are two problems with these methods. First, the transfection of DCs is inefficient, and second, there are practical and theoretical concerns that relate to the use of viral vectors in patients. As an alternative to these genetic modifications, Shibagaki et al. explored PTD-mediated antigen transduction into DCs to elicit CTLs that can lead to tumor rejection in vivo [17]. They demonstrated that a bacterial recombinant model tumor-associated antigen that was fused to Tat-PTD was efficiently transduced into murine lymphocytes and DCs and was processed by proteasomes. The resultant peptides were displayed on the cell surface bound to MHC class I. The transduced DCs were able to elicit CTLs in vivo, and the CTL activity was sufficient to both prevent engraftment with antigen-expressing tumors into mice and lead to a partial regression of the established tumor mass. 6.7 PTD-Mediated Modulation of Deregulated Cell Cycle of Cancer Cells In nonmalignant cells, the product of the Rb gene (pRb) binds to transcription factors belonging to the E2F family and represses their function as transcrip- tional activators [113]. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) inactivate pRb, release E2F from the pRb–E2F complex, and consequently upregulate the transcrip- tion of late G1 phase-specific genes responsible for S-phase entry. The Cdks are known to be activated through the formation of a complex with cyclins (A–D) and inactivated by p16INK4a, p21, and p27 [114, 115]. This well-organized regulation of the cell cycle is disrupted in malignant cells through genetic alterations, such as inactivation of p16INK4a, amplification of cyclin D1 or Cdk4, or loss or mutation of Rb gene [116, 117]. Therefore, reconstitution of the tumor suppressor function of p16INK4, p21, and p27 has been an aim for cancer therapy. As for p16INK4, it has been reported that a 20-amino acid poly peptide in the third ankyrin-like repeat of p16 is sufficient to inhibit cyclin D-Cdk4/6-dependent inactivation of pRb [118]. Based on this knowledge, Guis et al. demonstrated that this p16 polypeptide fused to Tat-PTD (Tat-p16 PTD-Mediated Delivery of Anticancer Proteins 311 peptide) was internalized into cultured cells and subsequently induced G1 arrest [119]. As for p21, Ball et al. demonstrated that a 20-amino acid peptide of the C-terminal Cdk-binding domain of p21 conjugated with antennapedia PTD suppressed pRb phosphorylation (inactivation) and consequently induced G1/S cell cycle arrest (Fig. 5) [120]. As for p27, in order to reconstitute its tumor suppressor function, it was fused to Tat-PTD and applied to human Jurkat A C B Fig. 5 C-terminal Cdk-binding domain of p21 conjugated with antennapedia PTD suppresses pRb phosphorylation and induces G1/S cell cycle arrest.

(B)pRb became hyperphosphorylated between 12 and 15 h after serum was added to starved HaCat cells, but in the presence of peptide I or II remained hypophosphorylated. pRb = hypophosphorylated, pRb* ¼ hyperphosphorylated. (C) Cell cycle distribution of HaCat cells after culture in D-MEM medium containing 10% FCS alone or 10% FCS with peptide I or II. Note: Peptide I and II inhibited the phosphorylation of pRb and induced G1/S cell cycle arrest. This figure was modified from Ref. [120]; therefore, see Ref. [120] for details 312 H. Harada and M. Hiraoka T cells in vitro [121]. The Tat-p27 protein dose-dependently induced cell cycle arrest at G1. Snyder et al. demonstrated that the Tat-p27 tumor suppressor protein actually inhibited tumor growth in two mouse models, such as a H1299 subcutaneous solid tumor xenograft model and a more clinical-relevant perito- neal tumor model [122]. 6.8 Specific Delivery of PTD-Conjugated Macromolecules to Cancer Cells Several in vitro studies have reported other possibilities which may enable the delivery of the PTD-conjugated macromolecule specifically to the desired tumor in vivo. First, because tumor cells are reported to have unique glycosa- minoglycan on their surface, PTDs, which selectively interact with it, may enables us to selectively target tumor cells [55]. Second, by inserting a tissue- and organelle-specific cleavage recognition site between it and the macromole- cule, PTD may be cleaved off, resulting in the accumulation of the PTD-free macromolecules in the desired tissue and organelle [123]. Third, it is also possible to generate a PTD-linked protein drug that specifically acts on tumor cells without affecting normal cells, by applying transformed cell-specific pro- tein activity. Finally, by using a peptide that can be recognized by the tumor- specific membrane proteins, it may be possible to design a variety of proteins that are specifically internalized into desired tissues. 7 Conclusions and Perspectives Recent advances in molecular and cellular biological techniques have helped to reveal the mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis. Based on this knowledge, several ways of discriminating nonmalignant and malignant cells have been proposed, in order to develop PTD-mediated anticancer strate- gies. Good examples are the exploitation of tumor-specific phenomena, such as dysfunction of p53, suppression of the apoptotic pathway, accelerated IGF-I or ErbB2 (HER-2/neu) signaling pathway, or tumor hypoxia. Each strategy actu- ally showed expected anticancer effects; however, all of them have been achieved only in animal experiments. We are now confronted with the task of applying these strategies to the clinical setting. For that purpose, we cannot ignore the following problems: how to decrease the immunogenicity of PTD- conjugated macromolecules, and how to prepare enough high-quality PTD- conjugated macromolecule. Overcoming these problems should lead to the development of a new generation of anticancer strategies. In addition, the continuation of efforts to explore novel molecular mechanisms responsible for cancer-specific phenomena will pave the way to the development of an innovative PTD-mediated cancer therapy.

PTD-Mediated Delivery of Anticancer Proteins 319 Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics: Current Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies Michael D. Axelson and David E. Gerber 1 Introduction Few cancer therapies have attracted the level of interest given to monoclonal antibodies. These drugs, first approved for cancer treatment in the late 1990s, provide unprecedented target specificity. In so doing, they have begun to fulfill the concept put forth by Paul Ehrlich over 100 years earlier—a ‘‘magic bullet’’ that kills cancer, but does not harm normal tissues [1]. The production of monoclonal antibodies has captured the public’s awe and appreciation. The hybridoma techni- que, which entails the fusion of mouse and human cells into antibody ‘‘factories,’’ exemplifies the clinical benefits of biologic research. Perhaps most importantly, monoclonal antibodies offer the promise of effective cancer treatment, without the toxicities associated with conventional chemotherapy. In a number of instances, monoclonal antibodies have met expectations. The addition of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to standard CHOP chemotherapy increases 2-year overall survival for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) from 57% to 70%, without increasing toxicity [2]. Trastuzumab, a mono- clonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has markedly changed the clinical course of HER2-positive breast cancer. While the 25% of patients with tumors harboring this receptor tyrosine kinase have tradi- tionally had a more aggressive disease and worse clinical outcomes than patients with HER2-negative breast cancers, the availability of trastuzumab has, in essence, reversed this relationship. For patients with early stage HER2-postive breast cancer receiving adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy increases disease-free survival 18% and, in a population already experiencing 85% overall survival, increases overall survival an additional 5% [3]. Despite these successes, monoclonal antibodies have not received universal fanfare. While monoclonal antibodies generally do not cause the adverse effects D.E. Gerber (*) Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75390, USA e-mail: david.gerber@utsouthwestern.edu Y.

Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_11, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 321 characteristic of conventional chemotherapy—alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and myelosuppression—they are not without toxicities. Class-wide adverse events are related to antibody structure. The presence of mouse proteins in murine, chimeric, and humanized monoclonal antibodies may elicit acute, anaphylactic infusion reactions. Additionally, specific monoclonal antibodies have toxicities related to their individual molecular functions. Antibodies directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may cause significant dermatologic and gastrointestinal toxicities. Antibodies directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may cause bleeding, clotting, wound healing complications, hypertension, and—through effects on glomerular capillaries—proteinuria. Perhaps the greatest toxicities have occurred with anti- bodies designed to modify patients’ immune responses against cancer and other diseases. Experimental antibodies targeting and neutralizing the molecule cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), which downregulates T cell function, have caused autoimmune colitis that, in some instances, has required colectomy [4]. The monoclonal antibody TGN1412 alters immune responses through binding CD28, a T cell coreceptor. The elicited response is designed to dampen the immune response in autoimmune diseases and augment the immune response in patients with cancer. In a recent phase I clinical trial, 13 healthy volunteers were treated with TGN1412 [5]. Six of these individuals developed a severe cytokine-release syn- drome and multiorgan failure. In an era when the economics of health care have returned to the spotlight, concerns have also been raised about the high costs of monoclonal antibody development and use. One of the earliest hints at the enormous investment and opportunity monoclonal antibodies offer pharmaceutical companies occurred in 2004, when accusations of insider trading, related to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux), led to the indictment of ImClone executives and a well- known investor, Martha Stewart. In July 2008, the complex relationship between monoclonal antibody efficacy and cost was highlighted on the front page of The New York Times [6]. Largely because of the costs associated with monoclonal antibodies, economic considerations are now being included in oncology practice guidelines and expert recommendations for the first time. Monoclonal antibodies offer some of the greatest promise and pitfalls in med- icine. To provide researchers and clinicians with a greater understanding of this class of therapeutics, this chapter will review the history, production, structure, function, toxicities, and clinical applications of monoclonal antibodies in oncology. 2 History Paul Ehrlich’s concepts of targeting cellular receptors and optimizing the therapeu- tic index laid the foundation for modern cancer therapy [1]. Ehrlich shared the 1908 Nobel Peace Prize with Ilya Mechnikov, who observed that antibodies alone are not sufficient to kill targeted cells. It is the binding of antibodies, he recognized, that 322 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber subsequently allows white blood cells to effect cellular destruction. Today, these concepts remain relevant to our understanding of antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. It was not until the establishment of the hybridoma techniques of Georges Kohler and Ce´ sar Milstein [7] in the 1970s, however, that the design of therapeutic mono- clonal antibodies became possible. The hybridoma technique involved the fusion of mouse lymphoid cells with immortalized human myeloma cells. The antibodies produced by hybridoma cells were associated with a range of clinical toxicities, including fever, chills, flushing, rash, urticaria, nausea, bronchospasm, dyspnea, hypotension, renal dysfunction, and headache [8, 9], all of which were attributed to antibody interactions with target antigens [10]. In the first monoclonal antibody clinical trial in humans, a patient with lymphoma received Ab 89, which targeted a ‘‘human lymphoma antigen.’’ Following infusion, the patient experienced a decrease in the number of viable tumor cells, with no apparent toxicity [11]. Despite such initial reports suggest- ing few adverse effects, it became clear that with increasing quantities of infused antibody, patients were more likely to have systemic reactions. Ultimately, these reactions were recognized as patient immune responses to these early antibodies, which were composed entirely of murine (mouse) proteins [12, 13]. Human anti-mouse antibodies were recognized early on [14], but only later were they linked to diminished in half-life and efficacy of the therapeutic antibody. As with Ab 89, most early antibody clinical trials focused predominantly on lymphoma. Solid tumors such as melanoma [15] and gastrointestinal malig- nancies [8] were also studied, although with relatively little success. Further developments in antibody engineering led to the incorporation of human protein sequences into antibody structures. Chimeric antibodies (approxi- mately 2/3 human protein, 1/3 mouse protein) featured human m and k constant regions and murine variable regions [16]. Subsequently designed humanized anti- bodies (approximately 95% human protein, 5% mouse protein) contained even greater proportions of human proteins. In contrast with the chimeric technique, this process originated with a human antibody framework, to which murine antigen-binding hypervariable domains were added [17]. Chimeric and humanized antibodies provided distinct advantages over their entirely murine predecessors. Decreased murine components led to decreased immunogenicity. Increased human components promoted antibody interaction with patient immune functions— including complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) and antibody-dependent cel- lular cytotoxicity (ADCC)—thereby enhancing tumor cell kill. The first two monoclonal antibodies approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer treatment emerged from these techniques. Rituximab, approved in 1997 for the treatment of NHL, is an anti-CD20 chimeric antibody. It contains a human IgG1-k constant domain and variable regions from the murine monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody IDEC- 2B8 [18]. Trastuzumab, approved in 1998 for the treatment of a subset of breast cancer cases, is a humanized antibody directed against HER2. It contains the complementarity-determining region (CDR) of MAb4D5, a murine anti-HER2 antibody, in a human IgG1 backbone [19]. Subsequently approved antibodies Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 323 for cancer treatment, capitalizing on further advances in bioengineering, have been conjugated to toxins [20] and radioisotopes [21, 22]. Gemtuzumab ozoga- micin (Mylotarg) is an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated to the calicheamicin toxin that is approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leuke- mia (AML). Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) and Tositumomab (Bexxar) are anti-CD20 antibodies conjugated to the radioisotopes Yttrium-90 and Iodine- 131, respectively. In such instances, the antibody’s primary function is to target tumor cells and deliver the lethal payload. 3 Antibody Structure and Function 3.1 Antibody Structure Antibodies are composed of four polypeptide chains, two light chains and two heavy chains, connected by a disulfide bond (see Fig. 1). Together, these make up a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 150,000 Da. Thus, antibodies dwarf other classes of cancer therapies, such as small molecule inhibitors (mole- cular weight typically 400–500 Da) and conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs (molecular weight typically 100–200 Da). The heavy chain consists of three constant regions and one variable region; the light chain consists of one constant region and one variable region. There are two different light-chain constant regions, kappa (k) and lambda (l), which differ in amino acid sequence. k light chains make up 60% of light chains in endogenous human antibodies and are also the primary light chain in engineered, therapeutic antibodies [23]. Fig. 1 Antibody structure and fragments 324 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber In humans, the genes encoding heavy-chain proteins are located on chromosome 14; light-chain genes are located on chromosomes 2 and 22. Differentiating B cells undergo gene rearrangement of the variable, diversity, and junctional (VDJ) segments, resulting in a wide range of antigen recogni- tion. The variable region is located at the amino terminus of each heavy and light chain. Within the variable region, the complementarity-determining region (CDR) gives an individual antibody its specificity to a single antigen. Heavy-chain constant regions are classified as a, E, g, d, and m, which correspond to immunoglobulin isotypes A (IgA), E (IgE), G (IgG), D (IgD), and M (IgM), respectively. The four isotypes of g heavy chains correspond to IgG subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, which differ in ability to mediate host-effector responses (i.e., ADCC and CMC) [24]. They also differ pharmacokinetically; the half-life of IgG3 is only 7 days, in contrast to 21 days for other IgG subclasses [25]. Based on these properties, the development of monoclonal antibodies for cancer therapy has centered on IgG1 and IgG2 immunoglobulins [26]. Presently available therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in oncology are intact IgG molecules. However, antibody fragments are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. These smaller molecules (molecular weight 26,000–120,000 Da) offer the potential benefits of reduced immunogenicity, improved tumor pene- tration [27], and more homogeneous tissue distribution [28]. In some cases, monomeric or single-arm antibodies may overcome the tendency of traditional, bivalent antibodies to activate rather than suppress certain cell targets [29]. However, compared with intact monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments undergo more rapid systemic clearance [30], have lower antigen-binding affinity, and lack effector functions. To produce antibody fragments, enzymatic degradation with papain yields the Fc (fragment crystallizable) and fragment antigen-binding Fab (fragment antigen binding) regions (Fig. 1). The Fab region recognizes and binds to antigen. The Fc region may be involved in the recruitment of host effector functions by binding Fc receptors (FcR) on host immune cells. Alternatively, the Fc region may be conjugated to radioisotopes or toxins. Following enzy- matic degradation, antibodies may be reformulated into single chain variable fragment (scFv), (scFv)2 [31], Fab’ or F(ab’)2, diabody, or scFv-CH3 (mini- body) (see Fig. 1). The scFv and (scFv)2 consist of heavy- and light-chain variable regions connected by a peptide linker or disulfide bond. The Fab’ or F(ab’)2 is constructed of heavy- and light-chain variable regions, the light-chain constant region, and the CH1 heavy-chain constant region. Diabodies are similar to (scFv)2 but joined end to end rather than side to side. This structure promotes the assembly of a dimeric molecule with two functional antigen- binding sites. Minibodies are similar to (scFv)2 but also contain a CH3 heavy-chain constant domain, which gives them a longer half-life. These frag- ments may be modified further to impact circulating half-lives, antigen-binding properties, and suitability as a platform for conjugates [27]. Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 325 3.2 Antibody Production In the hybridoma technique (see Fig. 2), mice are inoculated with a specific protein, the desired antigenic target, over several months. The mouse is then sacrificed, and splenic lymphocytes are harvested. The murine splenic cells are coincubated and fused with immortalized human myeloma cells in vitro [32]. The fused cells grow into colonies that effectively serve as antibody-producing biologic factories. Each colony produces molecularly identical antibodies aris- ing from the same original mouse lymphocyte—hence the term monoclonal. Antibodies are then tested for specificity or desired immune effect. Spleen Mouse FusionMyeloma Cells Hybridoma Cell Purified Protein Purified protein consisting of the antigenic target is inoculated in the mice which then develop an immune response. After animal sacrifice, splenic lymphocytes are isolated and co-incubated with immortalized human myeloma cells in vitro. The cells fuse resulting in hybridoma cells and form colonies in cell culture. Selection of the colonies is based on antibody specificity or desired immune effect. Fig. 2 Monoclonal antibody production: hybridoma 326 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber Whereas antibodies produced via the hybridoma technique are composed entirely of murine proteins, it is possible to synthesize antibodies with increasing proportions of human protein via recombinant techniques. Antibody species (i.e., murine, chimeric, humanized, fully human) reflects the proportions of murine and human protein and can be inferred from the suffix of a specific antibody name (see Fig. 3). The production of recombinant antibodies is based on phage display libraries [33]. These antibody libraries come from immunized or nonimmunized donors, synthetic libraries, or a ‘‘single pot’’ library, containing only the antigens against which the immune response is directed. A library of phages (bacterial viruses) contains millions of ligands fused to the gene responsible for the phage coat protein. Expression of the fusion protein and its inclusion into new phage particles take place in bacteria and result in ligand expression on the phage surface while the gene encoding the ligand resides in the phage particle. The phage particles are then passed over a surface that binds and enriches for the desired phage surface ligand. Antibody variable domains encoding binding regions are fused on the surface of phages as minor coat proteins resulting in the expression of a scFv [34]. Further screening of the antibody–phage construct against immobilized antigen allows for selec- tion of higher binding affinities. The antibody gene fragments are then isolated and cloned into an expression vector, usually with a lac-promoter, and the phage protein coat is removed. This phagemid is then expressed in transformed cells allowing for the isolation of single colonies producing a monoclonal antibody [35]. Fully human antibodies may also be developed in mice. This requires inacti- vation of the murine immunoglobulin gene loci and replacement by human genes encoding the desired heavy and light chains, a process carried out through the use of yeast artificial chromosomes fused into murine embryonic stem cells. The genetically engineered mice are then bred with each other to select for the human genes [36].

In some instances, a single antibody may possess multiple antitumor properties. 3.3.1 Targeting Ligands and Receptors The discovery and characterization of tumor cell survival and growth signal pathways have improved the understanding of cancer. Capitalizing on this knowledge, monoclonal antibodies targeting specific molecules required for cancer cell survival have been developed. To provide a therapeutic ratio, these molecular targets are ideally unique to, over-expressed in, or mutated in cancer cells as compared to normal tissues. Monoclonal antibody targets may be circulating ligands, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or (a) Interference with receptor or ligand function EGFR VEGF TK Domain (b) Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) NK Cell Macrophage FcvRIIIa FcγRIIb FcγRIIa Phagocytosis Cell Lysis (c) Complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) C1q Complex C2a & C4b C3 C5 C5-9 Membrane Attack Complex (d) Toxin/radioimmunotherapy Radioisotope Toxin (e) Antibody-dependent enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) Activated Drug Prodrug Enzyme Fig. 4 Mechanism of killing 328 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber cell surface receptors, such as members of the HER family. After antibody binding, signal disruption can occur through neutralizing circulating ligand, steric hindrance of ligand binding to receptor, prevention of receptor subunit dimerization, or receptor downregulation. The anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab (Erbitux) binds EFGR, resulting in steric hindrance of receptor dimerization and partial occlusion of the ligand-binding region [37, 38]. The anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) prevents receptor homo- and heterodimerization [39]. 3.3.2 Recruitment of Host Immune Functions FcgR and Fc Interactions In some instances, the mechanism of action for therapeutic antibodies involves not only the binding of antibody to antigen but also the recruitment of immune effects through binding of the Fc region of the antibody to Fc gamma receptors (FcgR) on immune cells. There are six members of the FcgR family, each with distinct binding properties and immune effects. These include FcgRI (CD64), FcgRIIa/b/c (CD32), and FcgRIII a/b (CD16). These receptors are differentially expressed on neutrophils and macrophages (CD64, CD32, and CD16) and natural killer (NK) cells (CD16 only) [40, 41]. The binding of FcgR effects an equilibrium between activation and inhibition of the immune response [41]. FcgRIIb is an inhibitory receptor expressed on macrophages that prevents phagocytosis [42]. FcgRIII is an activating receptor on macrophages and NK cells. The recruitment of immune cells leads to phagocytosis, cytokine release, and tumor cell lysis. Phagocytosis occurs when FcgRIIa on neutrophils or macrophages bind to the Fc regions of antibodies attached to target cells. Macrophages then present antigens from tumor cells that have undergone phagocytosis to activated T cells. The subsequent release of cytokines amplifies immune cell recruitment and increases major histocompat- ibility complex (MHC) expression. Ultimately, these events result in antibody- dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC). ADCC Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), occurs when FcgR on effector cells bind to Fc regions of antibodies (Fig. 4b) [43]. The process involves binding of antibody to the target antigen, recognition of the Fc portion by immune effector cells, cross linking of Fc receptors, activation of effector cells, and release of cytotoxic granules containing granzymes, perforin, and granulysin [42]. While many cell types contribute to cytotoxicity, NK cells are considered the principal mediators of ADCC. In preclinical models, depletion of NK cells significantly decreases tumor cell kill in the presence of antibodies [44]. For ADCC, the most relevant Fcg receptors are FcgRIIb, the inhibitory FcgR, and FcgRIII. Mice deficient in FcgRIIb show increased tumor killing when treated with antibody, while mice deficient in FcgRIII are unable to arrest tumor growth [45]. Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 329 Polymorphisms in the human FcgRIII, which impact binding of immune cells to Fc, impact antitumor effects [46]. Among lymphoma patients treated with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, those patients homozygous for the FcgRIIIa 158 V polymorphism have significantly higher response rates than those with the FcgRIIIa 158F polymorphism in vivo [47] and in vitro [48, 49]. Engineering of IgG antibodies toward increased affinity for FcgRIIIa demonstrates enhanced NK cell activity [50]. The impact of host immune function on tumor cell killing has also been demonstrated by observations that the type, density, and location of immune cell infiltrates in pretreatment colorectal cancer specimens can predict clinical outcomes [51]. CMC Certain monoclonal antibodies also promote tumor cell killing through complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) (Fig 4c). IgM is the most effec- tive antibody for this mechanism, followed by IgG3 and IgG1 [23]. After binding to antigen, antibody C1q binding sites become available on CH2 domains, activating the complement cascade, releasing C3a and C5a, and ultimately generating the C5\u0002C9 membrane attack complex [40]. Comple- ment activation has been shown to be an in vivo mechanism of action by rituximab in mouse models, even in mice depleted of NK cells or neutro- phils [52]. 3.3.3 Prior to Delivery of Lethal Payload Monoclonal antibodies may be conjugated to radioisotopes, toxins, cytokines, enzymes, and drugs (Fig. 4d and e). In these instances, antibodies serve primarily a targeting role, delivering the lethal payload specifically to cancer cells. Despite the promise of these methods, the use of conjugated monoclonal antibodies remains limited. To date, the FDA has approved only three therapeutic con- jugated antibodies, two of which incorporate radioisotopes [ 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar) and 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin)] and one that incorporates the calicheamicin toxin [gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg)]. 90Y is a pure beta- particle (electron) emitter which has a path length of 5 mm and a half-life of 2.7 days. Because beta particles are not readily visualized, an additional radioisotope is required for imaging. 131I emits both beta particles and gamma rays, thereby providing diagnostic as well as therapeutic radiation. Compared to beta parti- cles, gamma rays have a shorter path length (1 mm) and a longer half-life [53]. Calicheamicin is an antitumor antibiotic that binds the minor groove of DNA and cleaves both DNA strands in a nonspecific fashion [54]. The use of other toxins, such as the ricin A toxin, diphtheria toxin, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin, has encountered numerous problems in clinical trials. These include local vascular effects, rapid toxin clearance, and toxicity in normal organs expressing the target antigen [55]. Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) (see Fig 4e) is another antibody modification. First proposed in 1987 330 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber [56, 57], ADEPT is a multistep process that begins with the infusion of a monoclonal antibody conjugated to a drug-activating enzyme. After binding of antibody to the target tumor antigen, a prodrug is administered and converted by the enzyme to its active moiety. Ideally, this approach results in a high concentra- tion of active drug at the site of the tumor, with relatively low systemic exposure. Several chemotherapeutic agents (including doxorubicin, methotrexate, 5-fluor- ouracil, and paclitaxel) and enzymes (including carboxypeptidase G2, aminopep- tidase, and b-lactamase) have been studied. To date, this technology remains limited to phase I trials [58]. 4 Clinical Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 4.1 Nontherapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies Although the term ‘‘monoclonal antibody’’ is currently most closely associated with therapeutic agents, monoclonal antibodies were used for diagnostic pur- poses, both in vivo and in vitro, well before they were used as anticancer drugs. In clinical pathology, the high degree of specificity of monoclonal antibodies often provides confirmation in cases that are not straightforward by micro- scopic appearance alone. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the process of tissue antigen recognition through the binding of antibodies. The antibodies can either be labeled with a dye [e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)] or be counterstained with a second, dye-labeled antibody. The latter of these two processes is more sensitive and is employed more frequently. IHC may con- tribute to tissue diagnosis. For example, tissue staining with anti-cytokeratin (CK)-7 and anti-thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1 antibodies may support a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); tissue staining with anti- CK20 antibodies may support a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. IHC may also guide treatment planning. For example, breast cancer tissue staining with anti- estrogen receptor (ER) or anti-progesterone receptor (PR) antibodies may result in the use of the hormone receptor modulator tamoxifen; breast cancer tissue staining with anti-HER2 antibodies may lead to the use of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody trastuzumab or the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhi- bitor lapatinib. Flow cytometry, a technique first developed in the late 1960s, applies similar principles to particles suspended in a stream of fluid, such as blood and other body fluids. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), a specialized form of flow cytometry, provides rapid and objective cell counting and sorting. Since the early 1990s, murine radioconjugates have been available for diagnostic imaging studies. Satumomab pendetide, an Indium-111 ( 111In)-labeled antitumor- associated glycoprotein (TAG)-72 IgG1, targets antigens on colorectal and ovarian cancers and is used to image these malignancies [59]. Three other antibodies, two conjugated to Technetium-99m ( 99mTc) and one conjugated to 111In are used to image lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers (see Table 1).

Gerber these diagnostic antibodies, slow biodistribution and systemic clearance, high liver uptake, and immunogenicity have limited their use. They have been largely replaced by positron emission tomography (PET) scans [60]. 4.2 Therapeutic Uses of Antibodies in Other Fields Although the therapeutic antibodies alemtuzumab, rituximab, and bevacizumab were originally developed as anticancer agents, widely applicable molecular functions have led to their use in other clinical contexts (see Table 2). Because alemtuzumab depletes T lymphocytes, it has been used in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to prevent and treat graft versus host disease [61]. The ability of rituximab to deplete normal B lymphocytes has led to its use in several autoimmune diseases, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus vulgaris, systemic lupus erythematosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (for which it is FDA approved) [62]. Bevacizumab is used topically for the treatment of ocular complications of diabetes and macular degeneration [38]. In addition, monoclo- nal antibodies are FDA approved for a number of noncancerous conditions. Among others, these include abciximab (ReoPro), a chimeric anti-glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibody used in the treatment of myocardial infarction and as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention; adalimumab (Humira), a fully human antitumor necrosis alfa (TNFa) antibody approved for the treatment of autoimmune disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis; and infliximab (Remicaid), a chimeric anti-TNFa antibody with similar clinical indications as adalimumab. 4.3 Therapeutic Uses of Antibodies in Oncology Currently nine monoclonal antibodies are FDA approved for the treatment of cancer (see Table 3): five for the treatment of hematologic malignancies (see Table 4) and Table 2 Non-FDA approved uses of cancer-targeted monoclonal antibodies in nonmalignant conditions Antibody Diseases Alemtuzumab Autoimmune disease – cytopenia Bevacizumab Age-related macular degeneration, secondary to choroidal neovascularization Diabetic macular edema Macular retinal edema, due to retinal vein occlusion Rituximab Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Evans syndrome, refractory to immunosuppressive therapy Graft vs. host disease, chronic, steroid refractory Pemphigus vulgaris, severe Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder Systemic lupus erythematosus, refractory to immunosuppressive therapy Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune or idiopathic Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 333Table3FDA-approvedmonoclonalantibodiesforcancertreatmentGenericnameTradenameCompanySpeciesSubclassTypeTargetDiseaseInitialapprovaldateRituximabRituxanGenentechChimericIgG1UnconjugatedCD20NHL11.26.1997TrastuzumabHerceptinGenentechHumanizedIgG1UnconjugatedHER2/neuHER2-positiveBreastcancer9.25.1998GemtuzumabozogamicinMylotargWyethHumanizedIgG4Conjugated:CalicheamicintoxinCD33AML5.17.2000AlemtuzumabCampathBayerHumanizedIgG1UnconjugatedCD52CLL5.7.200190YIbritumomabtiuxetanZevalinBiogenIdecMurineIgG1Conjugated:Yttrium-90CD20NHL2.19.2002131ITositumomabBexxarGlaxoSmithKlineMurineIgG2Conjugated:Iodine-131CD20NHL6.27.2003CetuximabErbituxImClone;Merck;BristolMyerSquibbChimericIgG1UnconjugatedEGFRCRCHeadandneck2.12.20043.1.2006BevacizumabAvastinGenentechHumanizedIgG1UnconjugatedVEGFCRCNSCLCBreastcancer2.26.200410.11.20062.22.2008PanitumumabVectibixAmgenHumanIgG2UnconjugatedEGFRCRC9.27.2006NHL:non-Hodgkin’slymphoma;CLL:chroniclymphocyticleukemia;AML:acutemyelogenousleukemia;CRC:colorectalcancer;NSCLC:non-smallcelllungcancer;EGFR:epidermalgrowthfactorreceptor;VEGF:vascularendothelialgrowthfactor. 334 M.D. Axelson and D.E.

Gerber four for the treatment of solid tumors (see Table 5). Their structure is distributed as follows: unconjugated (6), radioisotope conjugate (2), and toxin conjugate (1). Their species: murine (2), chimeric (2), humanized (4), and fully human (1). Their sub- classes: IgG1 (6), IgG2 (2), and IgG4 (1). Their targets: CD20 (3), CD52 (1), CD33 (1), HER2/neu (1), EGFR (2), and VEGF (1). For the treatment of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, antibodies are employed as monotherapy and also in combination with other agents. To date, it appears that the use of monoclonal antibodies as single agents may be more effective against hematologic malignancies, which are generally characterized by fewer molecular aberrations and greater respon- siveness to medical therapies than are solid tumors. For solid tumors, monoclonal antibodies may be most effective when combined with conventional chemotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. 4.3.1 Hematologic Malignancies Rituximab In 1997, rituximab (Rituxan), a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, became the first monoclonal antibody approved by the US FDA for cancer treatment. In addition to being the oldest, rituximab is arguably also the most successful therapeutic antibody in oncology. Because its molecular target is ubiquitous in malignant B cells, rituximab is a component of therapy for most types of B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab also serves as the backbone of the radioimmunoconjugates Yttrium-90 (90Y) Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) and Iodine-131 (131I) Tositumomab (Bexxar). Rituximab was developed by combining variable regions of 2B8, a murine anti-CD20 antibody, with a human Fc region [63]. Initially, rituximab was approved for with the treatment of relapsed/refractory follicular NHL (the most common low-grade NHL) based on data collected from several small trials [64]. Even- tually rituximab received approval as first-line therapy for the two most com- mon subtypes of NHL: follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Rituximab’s place in therapy can be broadly categorized as either initial use in combination with chemotherapy or maintenance monotherapy after achieving remission or significant response. CD20, the molecular target of rituximab, is an unglycosylated phosphopro- tein involved in calcium conductance. It is thought to help regulate B cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation [65]. The expression of CD20 on mature B cells underlies the therapeutic principals of rituximab. First, ritux- imab is used only in B cell NHL, and not in T cell NHL. Second, because normal B cells express CD20, rituximab has been used in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Third, because CD20 is not expressed on B cell pre- cursors, normal B cell populations may regenerate after rituximab treatment. The precise mechanism of rituximab’s antitumor activity eluded researchers for years. It now appears that rituximab recruits host immune functions, including both ADCC and CMC, to attack targeted CD20-positive cells. Rituximab may also promote apoptosis [66]. Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 337 As the case for other molecularly targeted therapies, researchers have sought to identify the subset of patients most likely to benefit from rituximab. The molecular markers B cell lymphoma protein 2 (bcl-2) (the first anti-death gene discovered [67]) and bcl-6 appear to provide lymphoma-specific signatures asso- ciated with response to rituximab. A retrospective analysis of a large clinical trial comparing CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) to CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP) found that patients with bcl- 2-positive lymphomas derived greater response and survival benefits from rituximab than did patients with bcl-2-negative tumors [68]. In this study, bcl-2 positivity was defined as bcl-2 expression in \u000350% of tumor cells by IHC. Bcl-6, a marker of germinal center origin and maturity of lymphoma cells, is associated with favorable prognosis in DLBCL [69]. However, the magnitude of benefit from rituximab appears greater in patients with bcl-6-negative lymphomas [70]. Rituximab is now a standard component of first-line treatment for DLBCL, the most common NHL subtype (accounting for over 30% of cases) [71]. The addition of rituximab to standard CHOP chemotherapy significantly increases radiographic response rates, event-free survival, and overall survival, without increasing toxicity [2, 72, 73]. The benefit of rituximab maintenance in DLBCL appears limited to those patients who have not received rituximab as part of their initial therapy [74]. Follicular lymphoma, the most common indolent lymphoma and the second most common NHL overall (approximately 25% of cases) [75] provided the initial clinical experience of rituximab. In phase I studies, one-time doses of 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/m2 and weekly doses of 125, 250, and 375 mg/m2 were evaluated [18, 76]. Common side effects included fever, chills, rash, urticaria, and nausea. In single-agent phase II studies, response rates ranged 46\u000248% and time to progression (TTP) ranged 10–13 months [64, 76]. Rituximab has also demonstrated benefit when added to combination cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced follicular lymphoma [77, 78]. In addition, rituximab is used for the treatment of other low-grade CD20-positive lymphomas, such as small lym- phocytic lymphoma (SLL) [which is also known as chronic lymphocytic leuke- mia (CLL)], marginal zone lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (also known as Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia) [63, 79]. Yttrium-90 Ibritumomab Tiuxetan and Iodine-131 Tositumomab Yttrium-90 (90Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) and iodine-131 (131I) tositu- momab (Bexxar) are collectively known as radioimmunotherapy. Both drugs consist of radioisotopes conjugated to a murine anti-CD20 antibody. They are indicated for the treatment of refractory B cell NHL. NHL is generally considered exquisitely radiosensitive, but the systemic nature of the disease precludes the use of standard external beam radiation therapy in most patients. Radioimmunotherapy capitalizes on the high degree of specificity of monoclo- nal antibodies to deliver high doses of ionizing radiation to the targeted tumor, while sparing normal tissues. The principles of radioimmunotherapy were first 338 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber demonstrated by Lym-1, an early murine IgG2a antibody targeting HLA- DR10, a cell surface protein present on over 80% of lymphoma cells. Lym-1 was found to be more effective when conjugated to Iodine-131, with a response rate of 52%, over half of which were complete responses [80]. To limit nonspecific targeting, patients receiving either ibritumomab or tositumomab undergo a multistep treatment process. First, patients receive unlabeled anti-CD20 antibody to clear circulating B lymphocytes and saturate nontumor sites. They then receive a nontherapeutic dose of radiolabeled anti- CD20 antibody and undergo imaging to assess drug biodistribution and loca- lization. Several days later, the therapeutic radiolabeled antibody is adminis- tered, dosed by millicurie (mCi) per kilogram body weight. Following treat- ment, patients are required to take radiation safety precautions (careful disposal of body fluids, including tears and sweat, and condom use) for one week [53]. 90Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan and 131I tositumomab are notable for being the only currently approved antibodies for cancer treatment that are composed entirely of murine proteins. Given the adverse effects associated with this species of antibody, and the ability to produce humanized and even fully human antibodies currently, the ongoing use of murine antibodies may not seem intuitive. For radioimmunotherarpy, murine antibodies offer the advan- tage of rapid clearance from the body. For instance, ibritumomab has an elimination half-life of 30 h, compared to 60 h for rituximab, a chimeric anti- body with the same molecular target. Thus, patients remain systemically radio- active for the shortest possible period. While this feature provides a benefit from a radiation therapy standpoint, it does present an immunologic quandary. Because of the high likelihood that a patient will develop anti-mouse antibodies, which could cause life-threatening infusion reactions in the future, ibritumo- mab and tositumomab are typically administered to a patient only once. 90Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan, also known as IDEC-Y2B8, consists of a murine anti-CD20 IgG1 monoclonal antibody (ibritumomab), a chelator (tiuxetan; isothiocyanobenzyl MX-DTPA), and a radioisotope. During the initial phase, in which dose distribution is assessed, Indium-111 ( 111I) is used in place of Yttrium-90 because Yttrium-90 is a pure beta emitter and therefore not readily imaged. In contrast, tositumomab is conjugated to the same radioisotope (Iodine-131) for imaging and therapy, as Iodine-131 emits both gamma rays and beta particles. Other differences between Yttrium-90 and Iodine-131 include energy (2.3 MeV for Yttrium-90 vs. 0.61 MeV for Iodine-131) and path length (mean of 5 mm for Yttrium-90 vs. 0.8 mm for Iodine-131) [81]. In a phase I/II trial of 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with refractory or relapsed CD20-positive low-grade, intermediate-grade, or mantle cell NHL, the MTD was 0.4 mCi/kg. The response rate was 67%, and 26% of patients achieved a complete response. Among responders, the median time to progres- sion was 13 months [81]. Based on this study and subsequent phase II trials [82, 83], 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan was approved in February 2002 for relapsed or refractory low-grade NHL [84]. Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 339 Tositumomab (Bexxar), a murine anti-CD20 IgG2a monoclonal antibody conjugated to Iodine-131, was first used in 1993 for the treatment of NHL refractory to chemotherapy [21]. Tositumomab administration begins with the infusion of unconjugated anti-CD20 antibody and 5 mCi 131I tositumomab on day 1. Whole body gamma counts are obtained over the next 7 days, followed by the infusion of unconjugated anti-CD20 antibody and therapeutic 131I tositumomab to deliver a radiation dose of 75 cGy [85], the MTD determined in phase I studies [21]. Early trials with 131I tositumomab yielded response rates greater than 65% with up to 38% complete response for patients with relapsed or refractory NHL [86, 87]. In patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, a single course of 131I tositumomab has yielded a response rate of 95%, a complete response rate of 75%, and 5-year progression-free survival of 59% [88]. Despite early concerns of severe and persistent hematologic toxicity from radioimmunotherapy, 131I tositumomab and 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan are now being incorporated into combination therapy regimens, some of which include hematopoietic stem cell support. A retrospective analysis demon- strated that patients with NHL who relapse after treatment with 90Y ibri- tumomab tiuxetan are able to tolerate subsequent courses of chemotherapy without major toxicities [89]. Conversely, radioimmunotherapy appears well tolerated and effective when given following standard chemotherapy. In a phase II trial, patients with advanced stage follicular lymphoma who received 131I tositumomab after six cycles of CHOP [cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, Oncovin (vincristine), prednisone] achieved rates of overall and progression-free survival 23% higher than those seen with CHOP chemotherapy alone [90]. Currently a phase III trial is underway comparing CHOP, rituximab-CHOP, and 131I tositumomab-CHOP in patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma. (ClinicalTrials.gov num- ber, NCT00006721) 90Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan also appears safe when administered prior to autologous stem cell transplant and does not prolong engraftment time [91]. Despite these promising clinical data, the toxicities, cost, and complexities of administration have limited the use of radioimmunotherapy. The murine anti- bodies induce an immune response. This may manifest as acute infusion reac- tions and human anti-murine antibodies (HAMA), which occur in approxi- mately 2% of patients treated with 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan and 9% of patients treated with 131I tositumomab. Myelosuppression 6–9 weeks after administration is common. Ten percent of patients treated with 131I tositumo- mab develop hypothyroidism [92]. The most feared complication of radioim- munotherapy is treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Rates of these late, generally incurable toxicities range 1.5\u00022.5% for 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan and 3.5\u00026.4% for 131I tositu- momab [63, 93, 94]. Because ionizing radiation is teratogenic, radioimmu- notherapy is contraindicated in all stages of pregnancy. 340 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) was the first conjugated antibody approved for cancer therapy in the United States. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, which is approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), is a humanized IgG4 anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (hP67.6) conjugated to the toxin calicheamicin [20]. CD33 is an immunoglobulin-like lectin (sugar-binding protein) found on myeloid cells. Its presence is used diagnostically to differentiate AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). After antibody binding, the gemtuzumab–CD33 complex is internalized. Through lysosomal hydrolysis, calicheamicin is released, causing DNA damage. In the three phase II trials that ultimately led to FDA approval, 26% of patients achieved remission, but the remission was typically short lived (median duration 6.4 months) [95]. In early clinical trials, fevers, chills, myelosuppression, and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) emerged as the primary toxicities of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. VOD, a condition in which the small veins of the liver are obstructed, results in fluid retention, weight gain, hepatomegaly, and hyperbilirubinemia. VOD is a long- recognized complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant conditioning che- motherapy regimens and appears to occur at significantly higher rates among transplant patients previously treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin [96]. Accordingly, the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin is generally limited to AML patients not considered candidates for future transplantation. Alemtuzumab Alemtuzumab (Campath) targets CD52, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol- anchored antigen present on mature B and T cells, but not on stem cells. Because CD52 is expressed on a greater lymphoid population than is CD20, alemtuzumab is more immunosuppressive than rituximab. Alemtuzumab was the first huma- nized antibody produced. In the early 1980s, its murine precursor, CAMPATH- 1, was noted to deplete bone marrow B and T cells [97]. In 1988, antigen-binding sites from CAMPATH-1 were incorporated into a human IgG framework, resulting in alemtuzumab [17]. Alemtuzumab was initially approved for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which it provides a response rate of approximately 30% and median overall survival of 16 months [98]. Currently, alemtuzumab is also indicated in the first-line setting, based on a phase III trial comparing alemtuzumab to chlorambucil, an alkylating agent that was previously the standard treatment of CLL. In this study, patients rando- mized to alemtuzumab had a significantly longer time to treatment failure (23.3 vs. 14.7 months; p ¼ 0.001), a significantly higher complete response rate (24% vs. 2%; p<0.001), and a significantly lower risk of progression or death (HR 0.58; p ¼ 0.0001) [99]. In clinical practice, potential immunosuppression limits the use of alemtuzumab. Up to 50% of patients who would otherwise be candidates for alemtuzumab have infections precluding its use, including Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, herpes Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 341 simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus reactivation [63]. It is recommended that patients undergoing treatment with alemtuzumab receive antimicrobial prophylax- sis, including the antibacterial drug trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the antiviral drug acyclovir, and the antifungal drug fluconazole [100]. 4.3.2 Solid Tumors: Trastuzumab Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody against the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antigen, was the first monoclonal antibody approved in the United States for the treatment of a solid organ malignancy. A potent growth regulator of breast cancer cells, HER2 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine in the same 4-member family as EGFR (HER1). HER2 lacks a ligand-binding domain but activates the intra- cellular tyrosine kinase domain upon heterodimerizing with other members of the HER family. This event triggers downstream signal transduction via med- iators such as the pro-survival Ras-MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) pathway and the anti-apoptotic PIK3 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT/ mTor (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. The binding of trastuzumab to HER2 is thought to cause cancer cell death by preventing HER2 dimeriza- tion and downstream signaling, promoting HER2 internalization and down- regulation, and recruiting ADCC [39, 101, 42]. HER2 is overexpressed in 20\u000230% of invasive breast cancers [102]. Tradi- tionally, HER2-positive tumors were considered more biologically aggressive than HER2-negative malignancies and were associated with worse clinical outcomes. The availability of trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive breast cancers has, in essence, inverted this relationship. HER2 status of tumor tissue is determined by IHC and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Breast cancers are considered HER2 positive if IHC staining is 3+ or FISH reveals more than six HER2 gene copies per nucleus or a FISH ratio (HER2 gene signals to chromosome 17 signals) of more than 2.2. A negative result is an IHC score of 0 or 1+, a FISH result of less than four HER2 gene copies per nucleus, or a FISH ratio of less than 1.8 [103]. If the IHC score is 2+, this intermediate result is confirmed with FISH. FDA approval of trastuzumab in 1998 for metastatic breast cancer followed several early phase trials demonstrating single-agent response rates in the 10\u000220% range [104–106]. In a phase III trial, over 400 patients with untreated, HER2+ breast cancer were randomized to standard chemotherapy with or without trastuzumab. Overall response rate, TTP, duration of response, and OS were all significantly improved in the trastuzumab arm [107]. In these studies, expected adverse events included infusion reactions, fever, and chills. What was not anticipated was the development of cardiac toxicity in a substantial propor- tion of patients. Cardiomyopathy occurred in 27% of patients treated with anthracycline–cyclophosphamide chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, in 8% of 342 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber patients treated with anthracycline–cyclophosphamide chemotherapy alone, in 13% of patients treated with paclitaxel chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, and in 1% of patients treated with paclitaxel chemotherapy alone. Lack of an animal model has hindered the elucidation of a precise mechan- ism of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity [39]. One hypothesis is that this effect relates to the role of HER2 in cardiac embryonic development [108]. Unlike doxorubicin-associated cardiac dysfunction, trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity results in cellular dysfunction, not death, and is generally rever- sible. Because trastuzumab cardiotoxicity is not dose dependent, serial mea- surement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is recommended through- out the course of therapy. This includes assessments at baseline, every 3 months during therapy, and every 6 months after therapy for up to 5 years [109]. If a patient has an absolute decrease of greater than 15% in LVEF from pretreat- ment values or an LVEF below the institutional limits of normal and an LVEF absolute decrease of 10% or greater from pretreatment values, trastuzumab therapy should be interrupted. If LVEF returns to normal limits and the LVEF absolute decrease is 15% or less within 4–8 weeks, trastuzumab therapy may be resumed. Permanent discontinuation is recommended when the decline in LVEF persists or if therapy is held on more than three occasions for cardio- myopathy. About 75% of patients with trastuzumab-associated cardiac dys- function are symptomatic, and about 80% improve with standard medical management of congestive heart failure [107, 110]. In response to the significant rate of cardiac toxicity uncovered in clinical studies for metastatic breast cancer, subsequent trastuzumab trials in the adjuvant (postoperative) setting have been designed to minimize this risk. Specifically, these studies have avoided the concomitant administration of trastuzumab and anthracycline chemotherapy drugs. In the B-31 trial, patients received adjuvant adriamycin– cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, followed by paclitaxel chemotherapy, with or without trastuzumab. In this study, trastuzumab was started only after the completion of adriamycin and continued for up to 1 year. The addition of trastuzumab resulted in a 33% reduction in the risk of death (p=0.015). Fewer than 5% of patients experienced serious cardiac events [3]. The Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial enrolled 3,401 patients and compared 1 or 2 years of adjuvant (post- operative) trastuzumab with observation alone after neoadjuvant (preopera- tive) or adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy. The unadjusted HR for risk of death with trastuzumab compared to observation was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.47–0.91; p=0.0115) [111]. The optimal duration of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting remains unknown. In the Finland Herceptin (FinHer) Study, the subset of 232 HER2+ patients were randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with or without nine weekly doses of trastuzumab. The addition of this relatively short course of trastuzumab significantly improved 3-year recurrence-free survival (89% vs. 78%; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21\u00020.83; p=0.01) [112]. Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 343 Cetuximab Cetuximab (Erbitux), previously known as C225, is a chimeric IgG1 monoclo- nal antibody that binds to EGFR. EGFR, which is expressed in multiple cancer types (among them colorectal, lung, head and neck, and pancreatic), has been studied as a potential target for cancer therapy since the early 1980s [113]. EGFR contributes to cellular proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and inhi- bition of apoptosis. Overall, the effects of cetuximab resemble those of EGFR small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors [e.g., erlotinib (Tarceva)]. Cetuximab binding blocks EGFR tyrosine kinase activation, thereby abrogating down- stream signaling via intracellular mediators. Specifically, antibody binding causes a conformational change that sterically hinders EGFR dimerization [38]. In contrast to EGFR small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, however, cetuximab appears to provide further antitumor effect by recruiting host immune functions (CMC and ADCC). Cetuximab also leads to long-term EGFR downregulation by promoting EGFR internalization and degradation [114]. The main clinical toxicities of cetuximab are rash, diarrhea, hypomagne- semia, and infusion reactions. Cetuximab was first approved, in combination with cytotoxic chemother- apy, for the treatment of recurrent or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. In a phase III clinical trial of patients with metastatic colorectal progressing on irinotecan-based chemotherapy, the addition of cetuximab provided a median time to progression of 4.1 months [115]. In the Erbitux plus Irinotecan for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (EPIC) study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer progressing on oxaliplatin-containing regimens were randomized to irinotecan with or without cetuximab. Patients in the cetuximab arm achieved statistically significantly longer progression-free survival (4.0 vs. 2.6 months) (HR, 0.692; 95% CI, 0.617\u00020.776; p<0.0001), higher radiographic response rate (16.4% vs. 4.2%; p<0.0001), and better scores in a quality-of-life analysis (p=0.047). However, the median overall survival was comparable between treatments: 10.7 months with cetuximab-irinotecan and 10.0 months with irinotecan alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.975; 95% CI, 0.854\u00021.114; p=0.71). The investigators attributed this finding to the high rate (47%) of subsequent cetuximab use among patients randomized to irinotecan alone [116]. More recently, cetuximab has been added to first-line chemotherapy regimens. In the Cetuximab Combined with Irinotecan in First-Line Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRYSTAL) trial, 1,217 patients were randomized to FOL- FIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) with or without cetuximab. The addition of cetuximab provided a statistically significant but clinically modest increase in median progression-free survival: 8.9 vs. 8.0 months (p=0.036) [117]. Cetuximab is also FDA approved for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In a phase III trial, patients with locally advanced HNSCC were randomized to radiation therapy with or without cetuximab. The addition of cetuximab provided a 344 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber clinically meaningful improvement in median overall survival (49 vs. 29 months; HR, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.57–0.97) [118]. An unexpected toxicity observed in clinical studies of cetuximab plus radiation for HNSCC was cardiopulmonary arrest, which resulted in an FDA-mandated black box warning. It is not clear if this is related to hypomagnesemia or other electrolyte disturbances. Because cisplatin- based concomitant chemoradiation is generally considered the standard treat- ment of locoregionally advanced HNSCC, many clinicians reserve radiation plus cetuximab for those patients who would not tolerate cisplatin-based concomitant chemoradiation. It has been proposed that the apparent synergy between cetux- imab and radiation therapy is due to interference with the function of EGFR in the repair of double stranded DNA breaks caused by ionizing radiation [119]. In the recurrent/metastatic setting, cetuximab has been combined with chemother- apy for the treatment of recurrent HNSCC. The addition of cetuximab to cisplatin and 5-FU chemotherapy increased median OS from 7.4 months to 10.1 months (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64\u00020.99; p=0.04) [120]. Compared to the clinically meaningful benefit of trastuzumab in the treat- ment of breast cancer, the impact of cetuximab, particularly in the treatment of colorectal cancer, may appear rather modest. One potential explanation for these differences is the ability to predict treatment response and to identify those patients most likely to benefit from therapy. For trastuzumab, this has been achieved through the early recognition that its clinical effect was limited to the 25% of breast cancer cases that overexpress HER2/neu. For cetuximab, identi- fying the optimal patient population remains elusive. Many clinical trials employing cetuximab for the treatment of colorectal cancer have limited enroll- ment to those patients whose tumors express EGFR [115–117]. Indeed, the formal FDA approval is for colorectal tumors with positive EGFR staining by IHC. However, it has been demonstrated that the effect of cetuximab may be independent of the degree of tumor EGFR expression [121]. This lack of correlation has been attributed to differences in EGFR expression between primary and metastatic tumor lesions, heterogeneous EGFR expression within an individual tumor, changes in EGFR expression over time, unreliable and inconsistent IHC scoring, and the contribution of host effector functions (e.g., ADCC) to the antitumor effects of cetuximab [121–124]. As observed in clinical trials of EGFR small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors [e.g., erlotinib (Tar- ceva)] [125], cetuximab-treated patients who develop an acneiform rash appear to have significantly improved outcomes compared to patients who do not develop this effect [126, 127]. In lung and colorectal cancer patients, EGFR gene copy number assessed by FISH may predict response to cetuximab [128, 129]. More recently, attention has turned to the mutation status of K- ras, a proto-oncogenic mediator in the EGFR signal transduction pathway. When K-ras is mutated, as occurs in approximately 25% of lung cancer cases [130] and over 30% of colorectal cancer cases [131], downstream pro-survival pathways are constitutively activated despite EGFR inhibition. As a result, cetuximab appears to provide no benefit to these patients. In one series of patients with refractory colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab, objective Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 345 response rates were 40% for patients with wild-type K-ras, vs. 0% for patients with mutated K-ras. Median overall survival was 43 and 27 months, respec- tively [131]. In addition, expression levels of the EGFR ligands epiregulin and amphiregulin appear to correlate with response to cetuximab. Patients with colorectal tumors featuring high levels of epiregulin and amphiregulin are more likely to have disease control with cetuximab [132]. Panitumumab Panitumumab (Vectibix) is the first fully human (i.e., no murine protein com- ponents) monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for use in cancer therapy. Formerly called ABX-EGF, panitumumab is an IgG2 antibody directed against EGFR. Panitumumab was initially developed using XenoMouse trans- genic technology, whereby mouse immunoglobulin genes are replaced by DNA sequences encoding human antibodies. Based on observations from earlier clinical trials with cetuximab, the frequency and severity of rash was considered a pharmacodynamic endpoint in panitumumab dose-finding studies [133]. As expected, the fully human protein structure of panitumumab is associated with fewer hypersensitivity reactions and a longer half-life than are comparable antibodies featuring murine components. In panitumumab clinical trials, 4% of patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions (1% serious). In contrast, with the chimeric anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in 19% of patients (3% serious) [122]. Consequently, pre- medication with an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) is required for cetux- imab, but not for panitumumab. With a half-life 50% longer than that of cetuximab, panitumumab is dosed every 2 weeks as compared to weekly dosing for cetuximab. FDA approval of panitumumab for colorectal cancer followed a phase III clinical trial in which 463 patients with EGFR-positive chemotherapy- refractory metastatic colorectal cancer were randomized to panitumumab plus best supportive care vs. best supportive care alone. Patients receiving panitu- mumab had significantly higher objective response rates (10% vs. 0%; p<0.0001) and longer progression-free survival (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44\u00020.66; p<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was only days longer in the panitumumab arm (8 weeks vs. 7.3 weeks); however, mean progression- free survival was 13.8 weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 weeks for supportive care alone [134]. Whether panitumumab’s IgG2 structure—which is generally considered to lack the immune function recruitment properties of IgG1—is clinically relevant remains unknown. Bevacizumab Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is the principal mediator of angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from preexisting vasculature. Angiogenesis is an essential component of tumor development and progression, 346 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber as tumor cells cannot survive more than 2\u00023 mm from their blood supply [135]. The binding of VEGF to the extracellular domain of VEGF receptors (VEGFR) on vascular endothelial cells activates an intracellular tyrosine kinase. The activated tyrosine kinase generates downstream signals resulting in vascular proliferation [136]. Bevacizumab appears not only to disrupt angio- genesis but also to normalize preexisting tumor blood vessels. That is, it decreases tumor vessel tortuosity and tumor interstitial pressure, effects that may promote the delivery of other anticancer therapies [137, 138]. With approval for three of the most common malignancies—breast, lung, and colorectal cancer—bevacizumab has become one of the most widely used monoclonal antibodies in oncology. Because bevacizumab affects normal as well as malignant angiogenesis, it is associated with several toxicities. Patients receiving bevacizumab may experi- ence bleeding, clotting (primarily arterial [139]), hypertension, and—through effects on glomerular capillaries—proteinuria [140]. Wound healing complica- tions and reports of gastrointestinal perforation have led to recommendations that major surgical procedures not be performed within 8 weeks of bevacizu- mab administration [141]. Bevacizumab is contraindicated in patients with squamous cell histology nonsmall cell lung cancer because in phase II clinical trials, these patients experienced unacceptably high levels of life-threatening hemoptysis [142]. The safety of bevacizumab in patients with primary or meta- static brain tumors remains unclear. In a phase II trial of irinotecan chemother- apy plus bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, 1 of 35 patients developed intracranial hemorrhage, which occurred during the tenth cycle of therapy [143]. While the presence of brain metastases was an exclusion criteria in bevacizumab phase III clinical trials for lung, breast, and colorectal cancers, more recent experience suggests that rates of CNS bleeding are not increased in patients with previously treated (i.e., surgery and/or radiation) brain metastases [144–146]. Currently, bevacizumab is FDA approved in combination with chemother- apy for advanced colorectal, breast, and lung cancers. For colorectal cancer, it is administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks with FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI (5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan) regimens [147–149]. For breast cancer, it is given at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks with paclitaxel chemotherapy. FDA approval in February 2008 of this combination followed a randomized phase III clinical trial in which the addition of bevaci- zumab significantly improved median progression-free survival (11.8 months vs. 5.9 months) but not overall survival [150]. The approval was granted despite the fact that an FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted narrowly (5 to 4) against recommending approval in December 2007 [151]. For nonsmall cell lung cancer (nonsquamous histology), bevacizumab administration is 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks with carboplatin-paclitaxel chemotherapy. In a phase III trial of this regimen, despite the exclusion of patients at high risk for bleeding (preexisting hemoptysis, brain metastases, anticoagulation, and squamous cell histology), there were 15 treatment-related deaths, 5 from pulmonary hemor- rhage [152]. Given the high cost of bevacizumab, preliminary results of a Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 347 European study in which patients with advanced NSCLC were randomized to cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy alone, cisplatin-gemcitabine plus bevaci- zumab 7.5 mg/kg, or cisplatin-gemcitabine plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg were greeted with interest, as both doses of bevacizumab were associated with prolonged progression-free survival [153]. Because the development and proliferation of most tumors are thought to depend on angiogenesis, bevacizumab has also been studied in several other clinical settings. For the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, single-agent bevacizumab 10 mg/kg significantly prolonged time to progression com- pared to placebo [154]. In a subsequent phase III renal cell carcinoma study, patients randomized to interferon alfa-2a plus bevacizumab had a median progression-free survival of 10.2 months, compared to 5.4 months for patients randomized to interferon alfa-2a alone [155]. For the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, which is traditionally associated with a median survival of 3–6 months, irinotecan chemotherapy plus bevacizu- mab resulted in 46% 6-month progression-free survival and 77% 6-month overall survival rates [156]. Other malignancies under study include ovarian cancer, (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00262847) hepatocellular cancer, gastric cancer [140], pancreatic cancer [157], and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Clin- icalTrials.gov, NCT00486759). The individual tailoring of anti-angiogenic therapies is particularly challen- ging. The VEGF pathway involves both tumor and patient biology. VEGF may be secreted by tumor cells or by host stromal cells. VEGFR may be present on tumor cells or on host endothelial cells. Consequently, the factors that predict response to bevacizumab remain largely unclear. Tumor and serum levels of VEGF do not seem to correlate with response [157, 158], nor do tumor levels of VEGFR. In a recent retrospective analysis of tissue specimens from the phase III trial of paclitaxel plus bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer, the VEGF- 2578 AA and VEGF-1154 A polymorphisms were associated with outcomes [159]. Expression of CD31 (a marker of vascular endothelial cells) and platelet- derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-b have also been linked to response to bevacizumab in breast cancer studies [160]. Preclinical models suggest that both tumor and nontumor cell types may be involved in inherent and acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. For instance, inherent anti-VEGF refrac- toriness is associated with infiltration of tumor tissue by CD11b+Gr1+ mye- loid cells, and recruitment of these myeloid cells appears to confer refractori- ness. Furthermore, combining anti-VEGF treatment with an antibody- targeting myeloid cells inhibited the growth of refractory tumors more effec- tively than anti-VEGF therapy alone [161]. Other proposed mechanisms of resistance to bevacizumab include the upregulation of alternate pro-angiogenic pathways and increased pericyte coverage of tumor vasculature [162]. Given the cost and toxicities of anti-angiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab, further defining these molecular characteristics and applying them to patient selection is likely to be a research priority in the future. 348 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber 4.4 Characterizing ‘‘Targeted Therapy’’: Comparing Monoclonal Antibodies and Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitors In oncology, the ubiquitous term ‘‘targeted therapy’’ generally refers to mono- clonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. While drugs in each class often share molecular targets and have similar clinical indications, monoclonal anti- bodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors (which are alternatively referred to as small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, small molecule inhibitors, or small molecules) have several key differences that impact their clinical use (see Table 6). As previously discussed, monoclonal antibodies generally have a single molecular target. In many instances, small molecule inhibitors have multiple molecular targets. While this property may lead to greater antitumor effects, it also increases toxicities. As a result, small molecule inhibitors are often used as monotherapy [e.g., sorafanib (Nexavar) for hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, bortezomib (Velcade) in multiple myeloma, erlotinib (Tarceva) in nonsmall cell lung cancer, and imati- nib (Gleevec) in chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors], whereas monoclonal antibodies are often administered in combination with other treatment modalities, such as cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Because monoclonal antibodies are proteins, they would be denatured Table 6 Classes of targeted cancer therapy Property Small molecule TKIs Monoclonal antibodies Size \u0004500 Da \u0004150,000 Da Administration Oral* Intravenous Dosing Daily or twice dailyy Every 7–21 days Half-life Hours Days Specificity þþþ þþþþþ Targets Intracellular (kinases) Extracellular (cell surface receptors, soluble ligands) Mechanisms of action Inhibition of growth signals Direct inhibitory effects, ADCC, CMC, receptor internalization Drug interactions Multiple (via CYP450) None Immunogenicity None Infusion reactions, HAMA, HACA Cost $$$ $$$$$ *Two of the ten FDA-approved small molecule TKIs (bortezomib, temsirolimus) are administered intravenously. yBortezomib is given either weekly or every 3 days with periodic rest periods; temsir- olimus is given weekly.

Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 349 in the gastrointestinal tract and are thus administered intravenously. In con- trast, the majority of small molecule inhibitors are administered orally. The metabolism of small molecule inhibitors via cytochrome P450 enzymes leads to multiple potential interactions with drugs such as azole antifungals, macrolide antibacterials, certain anticonvulsants, and warfarin. In cases of shared molecular targets, functional differences between mono- clonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors may underlie apparent differ- ences in clinical outcomes [163]. For instance, the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab and the small molecule EGFR inhibitor erlotinib both result in attenuation of EGFR tyrosine kinase-mediated pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signal transduction. Cetuximab attaches to the extracellular domain of EGFR and prevents ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and activation of the intra- cellular tyrosine kinase. Erlotinib crosses the cell membrane and directly inter- feres with tyrosine kinase function. However, cetuximab also engages host immune functions and leads to long-term EGFR downregulation by promoting the internalization and degradation of the EGFR complex. Neither effect occurs with erlotinib. 5 Toxicities and Limitations of Monoclonal Antibodies 5.1 Infusion Reactions Most toxicities associated with monoclonal antibodies reflect the molecular targets and mechanism of the individual antibody. Indeed, monoclonal anti- bodies and small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting similar pathways often have similar toxicity profiles. For instance, both the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab and the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib (Nexavar) and sunitinib (Sutent) are associated with bleeding, clot- ting, and hypertension. Acneiform rash and diarrhea occur with the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, as well as with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib (Iressa). In contrast, infusion reactions, which are due to the nature of antibody production and structure, represent a class effect of monoclonal antibodies. To address these potentially fatal events, clinical researchers have examined such factors as duration of infusion [164]; the role of premedication with antihistamines, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids; and the molecular etiology of antibody infusion reactions. Infusion reactions may be broadly characterized as cytokine-dependent or hypersensitivity reactions [165]. Cyto- kine-dependent reactions arise from the interaction of a monoclonal antibody with molecular targets on tumor cells, blood cells, or effector cells, resulting in the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF a and interleukin (IL)-6 [166]. In a hypersensitivity reaction, the structure of a monoclonal antibody is recognized as an antigen by the patient’s immune system. IgE is produced and 350 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber sensitizes tissue mast cells and circulating basophils, resulting in the release of histamines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. The clinical features of these molecularly distinct syndromes overlap considerably and include bronchos- pasm, dyspnea, tachycardia, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema, and fever [167]. Because infusion reactions represent cytokine-dependent as well as hyper- sensitivity processes, the incidence of these adverse events is not always pre- dicted by antibody species. For instance, the humanized (5% mouse, 95% human) antibody trastuzumab causes infusion reactions in up to 40% of patients during the initial treatment [168]. In contrast, infusion reactions have been reported in only 12% of patients treated with the chimeric (1/3 mouse, 2/3 human) antibody cetuximab [169]. However, severe infusion reactions—which are most commonly due to hypersensitivity—occur in fewer than 1% of patients receiving trastuzumab, but in 3% of patients treated with cetuximab. Rituximab, a clinically potent chimeric antibody, is associated with the highest rate of infusion reactions (almost 80% overall and approximately 10% serious). In general, most infusion reactions occur with the initial antibody dose, with decreased frequency for subsequent administrations. Indeed, one retrospective series suggests that antihistamine premedication might be discontinued after two uneventful administrations of cetuximab [170]. Recently, it has been observed that patients in the southeastern United States (treated at selected centers in Tennessee and North Carolina) have a markedly higher incidence of cetuximab-associated severe infusion reactions (22%) than has been seen nationally (3%) [171]. These regional differences appear due to a higher incidence of preexisting serum IgE antibodies directed against galactose-a-1, 3-galactose, a moiety present on the Fab region of the cetuximab heavy chain [172]. 5.2 Drug Delivery With a molecular weight of approximately 150,000 Da, monoclonal antibodies are essentially 1,000 times larger than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs (MW typically 100–200 Da) and 500 times larger than small molecule kinase inhibitors. Consequently, issues of drug delivery have arisen, particularly related to the central nervous system (CNS). This observation has been most pronounced with the use of trastuzumab in patients with breast cancer. In some series, up to 25\u000250% of patients develop ‘‘sanctuary’’ brain metastases, a finding that has been attributed to trastuzumab’s enhanced control of systemic disease but apparent failure to cross the blood–brain barrier [173]. Because primary and metastatic brain tumors together affect approximately 200,000 people per year in the United States, the delivery of antibody-based therapeutics to the CNS compartment has received considerable attention. The observed efficacy of the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab for the treatment of high- grade gliomas may reflect the distribution of its molecular target; circulating VEGF is present on the systemic side of the blood–brain barrier. Direct intra- tumoral injection and convection-enhanced delivery, which provides a positive Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 351 pressure gradient via a motor-driven pump, have been employed for the admin- istration of 131I-TNT (tumor necrosis treatment)-1/B (Cotara). This monoclo- nal antibody binds to the histone H1–DNA complex, a universally expressed intracellular antigen that becomes available for targeting in the necrotic core of tumors due to increased cell membrane permeability [174]. The development of smaller antibody-based therapeutics may improve drug delivery (see Fig. 1). For example, a \u00043 kDa antibody fragment (about 1/50 the size of an intact monoclonal antibody) comprising two CDRs (VHCDR1 and VLCDR3) and a framework region (VHFR2) targeted against the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) envelope antigen gp350/220 was shown to have similar antigen recognition as its parent molecule but superior capacity to penetrate tumors in murine EBV-induced tumors [175]. Other antibody fragments under study include 131I Mel-14 F(ab’)2, which targets glycoproteins present in melanoma and glioma cells [176], and ranibizumab-F(ab)2, which targets VEGF for the treatment of ocular diseases [177]. Minibodies are genetically engineered con- structs, 80 kDa in size, that maintain antigen binding but have improved tumor uptake compared to their parent antibodies. The T84.66 (cT84.66) minibody is an antibody construct (VL-linker-VH-CH3) that binds carcinoembryonic anti- gen (CEA) and has been conjugated to Iodine-123. In a pilot trial of 10 patients with colon cancer, cT84.66 targeted the tumor [178]. Further studies are under- way to examine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of this therapeutic agent. 6 Areas of Current and Future Development 6.1 Antibody Engineering The utilization of monoclonal antibodies as a therapeutic platform continues to evolve. The progression from murine to entirely human antibodies represents only one aspect of this process. Refined bioengineering is leading to improvements in techniques of toxin, radioisotope, and drug conjugation. As previously described, the use of antibody fragments may overcome issues related not only to the large size of intact monoclonal antibodies but also to their immunogenicity. However, it will take years to implement these developments into clinical practice. In the near future, the greatest clinical advances in antibody therapy are likely to come not from improved antibody design and production, but rather from an improved understanding of the diseases these drugs target. Specifically, the identification and elucidation of the processes that underlie the development and progression of cancer will result in new molecular targets for antibody therapy. 6.2 Targets In the evaluation of potential targets for antibody-based therapy, a number of properties are considered. Ideally, these targets have selective cell-surface 352 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber expression present of malignant cell but not on normal cells, have high cell-surface density, and be anchored to the cell surface membrane (rather than secreted). By promoting the binding of antibodies to malignant but not normal cells, these characteristics optimize the therapeutic margin. A recent review of molecular therapeutics examined over 1,000 candidate drugs that entered clinical study between 1990 and 2006 [26]. During this period, the 10 most frequently targeted molecules were epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), EFGR, mucin-1 (MUC1/CanAg), CD20, CEA, HER2, CD22, CD33, Lewis Y antigen, and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Four of these molecules (EGFR, CD20, HER2, and CD33) are targeted by seven of the monoclonal antibodies currently approved for cancer therapy. Table 7 lists monoclonal antibodies currently in late-phase clinical develop- ment. These drugs target a number of molecules, including CD20, CD22, EGFR, EpCAM, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4). Targeting CTLA-4, a molecule involved in Table 7 Selected monoclonal Ab oncology phase III trials Condition Drug Target Start date NCT Colon cancer Edrecolomab 17-1A 5.1997 7.1997 NCT00002968 NCT00309517 Ovarian cancer; peritoneal cavity 90Y monoclonal antibody HMFG1 HMFG-1 12.1998 NCT00004115 SCLC BEC2 and BCG Anti-idiotypic 9.1999 NCT00006352 AML Lintuzumab CD33 3.2000 NCT00006045 Lymphoma Epratuzumab CD22 9.2001 NCT00022685 Neuroblastoma Ch14.18 with chemotherapy GD2 10.2001 NCT00026312 RCC I24I-cG250 G250 8.2004 3.2208 NCT00087022 NCT00606632 Melanoma, metastases MDX-010 CTLA4 9.2004 NCT00094653 Mycosis Fungoides Zanolimumab CD4 7.2005 NCT00127881 Kidney cancer cG250 (Rencarex) MN 9.2005 NCT00209183 Melanoma Tremelimumab (CP- 675,206) CTLA4 3.2006 NCT00257205 NSCLC CP-751, 871 IGF-1R 3.2008 NCT00596830 FL CLL Ofatumumab-HuMax- CD20 CD20 3.2006 6.2006 NCT00394836 NCT00349349 Prostate cancer Denosumab RANKL 4.2006 NCT00321620 HNSCC Zalutumumab EGFR 10.2006 NCT00382031 AML: acute myelogenous leukemia; BCG: Bacillus Calmette-Gue´rin; CLL: chronic lympho- cytic leukemia; CTLA4: Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4; EGFR: epidermal growth factor recptor; FL: follicular lymphoma; GD2: disialoganglioside; HMFG-1: human milk fat globulin 1; HNSCC: head and neck squamous cell cancer; IGF1-R: insulin like growth factor receptor 1; MN: a cell surface antigen found on 90% of renal cell carcinomas; NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; RANKL: Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand; RCC: Renal Cell Carcinoma; SCLC: small cell lung cancer. Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 353 suppression of T cell function, appears to promote immune rejection of tumors. The anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies ipilumumab and tremilimumab are currently under study for the treatment of melanoma, a malignancy generally considered resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and potentially sensitive to immune-based approaches [179, 180]. Anti-IGF-1R antibodies have demon- strated encouraging activity in a variety of malignancies, including breast, liver, colorectal, and prostate cancer, as well as sarcomas. In a study of carboplatin- paclitaxel chemotherapy plus the anti-IGF-1R antibody CP-751,871 for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC, 72% of patients with squamous cell tumors achieved an objective response [181]. These early results are particularly encouraging because recent therapeutic advances for NSCLC have not been highly applicable to squamous cell histology, which is relatively insensitive to EGFR inhibition and is contraindicated with anti-VEGF therapy because of bleeding complications. IGF-1R serves as an example of a target that may be more appropriate for monoclonal antibodies than for small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Exquisite target specificity is likely to be clinically important, as IGF-1R has extensive sequence homology to the insulin receptor, which would promote significant hyperglycemia if inhibited [182]. 6.3 Economics Economic considerations may impact the future development and use of monoclonal antibodies. As increasing attention turns to the cost of health care, the price tag of these treatments is likely to come under scrutiny. For instance, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, the standard treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer until the mid-1990s, has an adjusted 2004 cost of $63 for 8 weeks of treatment. State-of-the-art combination chemotherapy regimens for this disease, featuring monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, cost over $30,000 for 8 weeks of treatment [183]. These treat- ments have doubled the median survival of patients with metastatic color- ectal cancer, a clinically meaningful benefit that, to date, has made it difficult to consider limiting the use of these drugs. In a survey study of medical oncologists, respondents generally believed that treatments up to $300,000 per quality-adjusted life-year were reasonable, and 78% stated that cost should not impact access to ‘‘effective’’ care. However, 71% felt that rising drug costs would lead to treatment rationing in the near future [184]. While patent expiration typically results in the availability of less-expensive generic medications, this process may be less straightforward for monoclo- nal antibodies. The molecular techniques used to develop monoclonal anti- bodies often include a number of patents. Furthermore, the FDA has yet to set out clear guidelines for the development of follow-along biologic agents or bio-similar agents [185]. It will be several years before this transition is tested. Rituximab and trastuzumab, approved in the late 1990s, are not expected to come off patent protection until 2015. 354 M.D. Axelson and D.E. Gerber References 1. Strebhardt K, Ullrich A.

Therapeutic Uses of Monoclonal Antibodies 363 Cancer Vaccines Zsuzsanna Tabi 1 Introduction The role of the immune system in preventing the development of tumours was first suggested by Paul Ehrlich in the early 1900s. Half a century later, Lewis Thomas and McFarlaine Burnet introduced the concept of immunosurveil- lance, meaning that immune cells while continuously patrolling the body recog- nise special antigens present only on transformed cells and eliminate these cells. They suggested that the type of cell responsible for tumour immunosurveillance is the T cell [1]. Direct experimental evidence confirming this hypothesis came from immunodeficient mouse strains, where the lack of certain components of the cellular immune response, such as interferon (IFN)-g, perforin, and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), lead to signifi- cantly more aggressive growth of experimental tumours [2]. More importantly, late onset of spontaneously occurring adenocarcinoma has been observed in IFN-g and perforin-deficient mice [3]. Indirect evidence in humans is the survival benefit of cancer patients with tumours infiltrated with activated CD8+ T cells, observed in numerous cancers such as ovarian, prostate, color- ectal, and mesothelioma [4–8]. The components of the immunosurveillance are the innate immune system, consisting of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) and NKT cells, and the adaptive immune system, represented by DC, B-cells, and T cells (Fig. 1). The first cancer vaccine was used by W.B. Coley in the 1890s who, based on his observation that in some cancer patients advanced tumours disappeared following acute streptococcal infection, used a mixture of several bacterial strains and injected straight into tumours. The treatment had varying success to cure established solid tumours. The reason why this treatment may have worked in some patients did not become clear until the 1980s when bacterial Z.

DC stimulated with bacterial products may be able to break anergy and tolerance of tumour-specific T cells, as discussed later. Coley’s treatment has a modern day counterpart: superficial bladder cancer is successfully treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) sprayed into the bladder. The ensuing immune response eliminates stage 1 cancer in an adjuvant setting in >80% of patients. When tumour cells encounter immune attack, due to their high mutation rate, some cells may develop resistance to the immunological pressure. The tumour developing from these cells is called ‘‘edited’’ as it is the result of an active anti-tumour response [9]. Edited tumours are less immunogenic than those not yet attacked by immune cells. Clinically manifesting tumours have escaped immune recognition, thus cancer vaccines need to target weakly immunogenic tumours which likely possess multiple mechanisms to evade the immune system. So it may not be surprising that the first generation of cancer vaccines showed a disappointing lack of clinical efficacy, although enhanced tumour-specific immune responses can be detected in vaccine recipients. The possible reasons for the lack of success are that (a) single antigenic entities are unlikely to work as Fig. 1 Tumour immunosurveillance and the role of the main immune cell types. The immune response against cancer may be initiated by cells of the innate immune system, by external damage to the tumour cells and via other mechanisms. Tumour antigens, taken up by dendritic cells (DC), are carried into secondary lymphoid organs where T cell priming occurs. CD4+ T cells provide help for B cell and CD8+ T cell responses. CD8+ tumour-antigen- specific T cells become activated and migrate to the periphery where they recognise and destroy malignant cells 366 Z. Tabi the tumour develops immune escape mutants, (b) bulky solid tumours are unlikely to be eliminated by activated immune cells due to immunosuppressive mechanisms of the tumour, and (c) patients with inoperable, multi-resistant, advanced disease are unlikely to respond to cancer vaccines. However, the lessons may show the way towards improved cancer vaccines. Treatment of less advanced patients, targeting several tumour antigens and multiple epitopes, combining vaccines with treatments which block tumour evasion and deliver adjuvant effects is more likely to succeed than the single agents used up to now. In this chapter, the main approaches in present cancer vaccine development for the treatment of solid tumours, current research directions, and critical challenges are discussed and some ongoing phase III trials are listed. 2 Cell-Based Vaccines 2.1 Adoptive T Cell Transfer (ACT) Large numbers of activated CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumour have a positive prognostic value in colon, prostate, ovarian, and other cancers [4–8], indicating a key effect of CD8+ T cells in tumour-immunity. T cell-based vaccines can be made by ex vivo expanding or manipulating tumour-specific T cells and injecting them back into the patient. The transferred T cells need to fulfil complex requirements, in order to act as potent tumour killers. They need to break the immune evasive mechanisms of tumours, infiltrate tumour tissues and eliminate tumour cells with a high degree of specificity followed by long- lasting protection. 2.1.1 T Cell Differentiation Status The first requirement for ACT is obtaining sufficient numbers of tumour- antigen-specific T cells with the right level of differentiation and activation status. Although several expansion protocols can achieve high cell numbers for transfer (\u0002105 cells isolated from the tumour, expanded up to 1011 in vitro), these T cells are not necessarily effective in vivo [10]. The reason for this is the nature of the expansion which in the past often consisted of prolonged in vitro cultures, resulting in large numbers of highly differentiated effector T cells. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a relatively short in vitro culture period of T cells results in cells more effective in adoptive immunotherapy [11]. These T cells contain heterogeneous T cell populations. Effector or effector memory T cells can attack tumour cells immediately upon cell transfer but they are short-lived cells, while central memory T cells require antigen-specific stimulation before proliferation and effector function but tend to adapt better to the environment and persist longer [12]. The longer persistence of transferred T cells with early memory phenotype than that of Cancer Vaccines 367 more differentiated T cells correlates with the length of their telomeres at the time of transfer and also with improved clinical responses [13]. Large numbers of T cells can be obtained for transfer from patients vaccinated with relevant antigens, although these T cells may have already undergone expansion and differentiationinvivo[14]. Otherapproaches to generate potent T cells for transfer may include the use of common g-chain cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-7 during in vitro T cell expansion [15], rather than IL-2, which drives terminal T cell differentiation. Interestingly, maturation of naı¨ ve CD8+ T cells into effector cells is inhibited by IL-21 but the resulting T cells are more effective in mediating tumour regression upon adoptive transfer than IL-2 expanded T cells [16]. 2.1.2 T Cell Subtype Traditionally, CD8+ T cells are regarded as the key T cell subset-mediating tumour rejection via direct cytotoxicity of tumour-antigen expressing, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I positive targets. The role of CD4+ T cells is less well understood, but it is generally accepted that CD4+ Treg cells can suppress CD8+ T cell function in a tumour-antigen-specific manner, while Th1 cells provide help via IL-2 and IFNg-production to CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells may also prevent tumour-angiogenesis and tumour-progression via simultaneous tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and IFN-g signalling [17]. Interestingly, in experimental models of tumour rejection, CD4+ T cells were shown to suppress the growth of MHC Class II negative tumours [18] via an indirect mechanism. While the presence of IL-17 by transfecting tumour cells with IL-17 induces more potent anti-tumour CTL responses [19], a recent study demonstrated that Th17 (T helper-17)-polarised CD4+ T cells can directly eliminate tumour cells [20]. In a mouse model of melanoma, adoptive transfer of TRP-1-specific in vitro polarised Th0, Th1 or Th17 T cells into mice with established tumours resulted in complete cure and long-term survival, unex- pectedly, not when Th1 but when Th17 cells were transferred [20]. In the model, Th17 cells had a survival advantage following transfer and their anti-tumour action was nearly entirely IFN-g mediated. However, the ratio of IFN-g and IL- 17 produced by T cells in tumour tissues may be crucial, as TGF-b-induced IL- 17-production by CD8+ T cells may promote tumour growth [21]. While the presence of CD4+ T cells is reportedly beneficial in adoptively transferred T cell-mediated tumour regression [11], the exact role of Th17 cells in the treat- ment of human cancer is awaiting confirmation. 2.1.3 Improving ACT by Lymphodepletion and IL-2 Treatment of Recipients Significant progress with ACT of cancer was achieved by the transfer of ex vivo expanded, tumour-antigen-specific T cells, isolated from tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), into patients who have received lymphodepleting che- motherapy and high-dose IL-2-treatment. The 50% objective response rate in 368 Z. Tabi heavily pretreated metastatic melanoma patients [11, 22] makes ACT in cancer the most promising immunological approach to date. Treatment with cyclophosphamide before cell transfer increases the rate of regression of established tumours in patients with metastatic melanoma, resistant to stan- dard therapies. Cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg for 2 days), followed by fludar- abine (25 mg/m2) for 5 days before T cell transfer in a cohort of 35 patients, resulted in objective clinical responses in 18 patients, including complete remission in 3 [11, 22]. The effect of lymphodepletion with these drugs may depend on the removal of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T cells (Treg cells, will be discussed later), as both cyclophosphamide and fludarabine have anti-Treg effects. Another possible explanation for the beneficial effect of lymphodepletion is that depleting host T cells in a non-selective manner before the transfer of tumour-specific T cells removes a significant pool of cells which would be competing for cytokines necessary for T cell growth and effector function (cytokine sink). A third possibility is that lymphodepletion not only spares professional antigen-presenting cells of myeloid origin (myeloid den- dritic cells) but increases their activation and maturation status while simul- taneously inducing tumour-cell apoptosis. These events may lead to the gen- eration of broader anti-tumour T cell responses via cross-presentation of tumour antigens derived from dying cancer cells. DC cytokine production may amplify the in vivo effector function of transferred T cells. Ongoing preclinical investigations are going a step further by increasing the intensity of lymphodepletion to a level which causes myeloablation and requires hema- topoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. The expansion of transferred T cells is supported by the haematopoietic stem cells in mice in a non-specific manner [23]. Further improvement has been achieved by giving full-body irradiation to melanoma patients with 2 or 12 Gy treated with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine chemotherapy as described above [12] (Fig. 2). The results, both by the RECIST criteria or by analysing 3-year survival rates, indicate that increasing lymphodepletion improves the anti-tumour effect of adoptively transferred T cells. The administration of high dose IL-2 to lymphopenic patients receiving adoptive T cell transfer is beneficial for the in vivo expansion and effector function of transferred T cells. High-dose IL-2 alone (720,000 U/kg every 8 h for 2–3 days) can cause tumour regression in some patients with advanced melanoma. However, IL-2 is also able to promote the rapid in vivo expansion of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. Furthermore, toxicity (vascular leakage and hypotension) is also a limiting factor in many patients. Thus, IL-2 is probably not the best cytokine to use in this context, and other cytokines which also signal via the common g-chain receptor, especially IL-15, may better be able to support the persistence and activity of transferred T cells without supporting Treg cells [24, 25]. Alternatively, simultaneous blocking or elimination of Treg cells [26] during IL-2 administration may improve the efficiency of transferred T cells. Cancer Vaccines 369 2.1.4 Modification of Transferred T Cells or the Host Environment Therapy with ACT is especially promising in metastatic melanoma, while in other cancers the success is more modest [12] – the reason for this is not clear, but may depend on the quality of T cells present among tumour infiltrating lympho- cytes (TIL) used for expansion. The input T cells should ideally have broad specificity and high avidity for tumour antigens. As this is not always the case even in melanoma, there is a great interest in creating such T cells by genetic modification. T cells after in vitro expansion should be able to infiltrate the tumour, exert effector function and persist in the host. Genes encoding TCRs isolated from cells with high avidity for known tumour antigens can be cloned into vectors, and these constructs can redirect the specificity of T cells to target cancer cells [27–29]. The first such clinical trial, in which melanoma patients were treated with autologous T cells transduced with a high-affinity TCR recognising MART-1 antigen, provided encouraging results [27]. This approach also makes it possible to achieve a relatively early differentiation stage from hematopoietic stem cells for the transferred T cells, which helps their persistence in the host following transfer [30]. Alternatively, reverting effector T cells to a less differ- entiated state by modulating transcription factors [31] is another idea presently in experimental phase. Retrovirally mediated TCR gene transfer may result in prolonged survival of transferred T cells, but the anti-tumour activity maybe lost due to specific loss of gene expression, as reported recently [32]. Genetic modification can also be used to generate T cells capable of tumour cell Fig. 2 Cancer immunotherapy by the adoptive transfer of T cells. (a) Tumour tissue, containing tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is removed from melanoma. Special tissue culture conditions favour T cell growth in vitro. (b) T cells are selected for tumour-reactivity and (c) tumour-reactive T cells are grown into large numbers. (d) The selected T cells are injected back into the patient who has been lymphodepleted by chemotherapy (CT) and radiation therapy (RT) 370 Z. Tabi recognition in an MHC-unrestricted manner. This approach is based on intro- ducing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) into T cells. CARs contain an extra- cellular domain that recognises a tumour-associated antigen and a fusion partner representing an intracellular signalling domain. The intracellular domain usually consists of the z-chain of the TCR complex and triggers T cell proliferation and effector function [33]. CAR modified, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted human T cells efficiently killed prostate cancer xenotrans- plants in mice [34]. Tumour eradication was directly proportional to the in vivo effector-to-tumour cell ratio. T cells needed to survive for at least 1 week to induce durable remissions. This approach holds promise as it overrides MHC restriction. However, further optimisation is necessary in order to allow co-stimulatory signalling and long-term survival of T cells. Tumour-homing of adoptively transferred cells can be improved by making the tumour environment less immunosuppressive for these cells. Aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 is responsible for immunosuppression in many cancers. Intraperitoneal injection of a STAT3 inhibitor into mice with intracranial glioma resulted in elevated IL- 15 levels, improved T cell persistence leading to improved survival [35], indicat- ing yet another new approach for making ACT work more efficiently. Autologous T cell transfer in combination with lymphodepleting chemother- apy and non-specific adjuvant treatment does not represent an easy off-the- shelf treatment, but so far it has provided dramatic evidence for the power of immunotherapy even in advanced patients with bulky, metastatic tumours, resistant to conventional treatments. Further optimisation of this system, which shows so much promise, will reveal if ACT is a viable approach in the treatment of not only melanoma but also other types of cancers. 2.2 Dendritic Cell Vaccines Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) which, unlike other APC, can migrate into lymph nodes and prime naı¨ ve T cells. DC are uniquely adept at antigen cross-presentation. The cross-presentation path- way in DC allows CD8+ T cell stimulation with antigen exogenous to DC, such as tumour-associated antigen derived from necrotic or apoptotic tumour cells. DC control immunity and tolerance via interactions with both the innate and the adaptive immune systems. They have three activation levels, such as immature (iDC), intermediate, and mature DC (mDC). These three stages can be described clearly by distinct phenotype and function. Immature DC typically reside in the tissues where they encounter pathogens and take up antigen. Antigen uptake in the presence of microbial products, called pathogen-associated molecular pat- terns (PAMP), or molecules released by stressed or dying cells (heat shock proteins, HMGB-1, S100 proteins, etc.), called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), trigger DC maturation. During maturation, intermediate DC Cancer Vaccines 371 upregulate MHC Class II and co-stimulatory molecules and chemokine receptor CCR7, the latter guiding them to lymph nodes. The main function of DC in the lymph nodes is antigen presentation to T cells. CD40-CD40L engagement, due to DC–T cell interaction in the lymph node, triggers transient IL-12 production which is the main cytokine necessary for enabling mature DC to prime naı¨ ve T cells and generate Th1-type responses. DC function can be fundamentally altered by tumours: tumour cells display neither PAMPs nor DAMPs while they produce granulocyte–monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), trans- forming growth factor (TGF)-b and IL-10 which negatively influence DC maturation, migration, cytokine production, and T cell stimulatory capacity. These tumour-conditioned DC may even stimulate the proliferation and activa- tion of T regulatory cells [36]. The aim of DC-based cancer vaccines is to generate a large number of DC ex vivo, load them with tumour antigen and mature them for the generation of efficient anti-tumour T cell immunity upon injection into patients. What seems a straightforward idea becomes extremely complex when searching for optimum efficiency, especially as our present under- standing of the workings of the immune system in cancer is still incomplete. The method of DC generation, the nature of the antigen, the way of loading the antigen, the optimum level of DC maturation, and the manner of delivery are all questions which might be easily answered in preclinical models but require constant trial modifications in groups of patients with advanced disease. The main approaches and the present standing of DC vaccines are summarised here. 2.2.1 Ex Vivo Generation of Autologous DC Large numbers of DC can be generated from peripheral blood cells or bone marrow cells by different methods. The most frequently used approach utilises GM-CSF and IL-4 for the generation of immature DC, which takes \u00025 days, and can be carried out in a closed culture system [37]. Other methods may differentiate CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors with IL-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor (SCF), or with GM-CSF, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a and Flt-3 ligand [38], IFN-b and IL-3 [39], or with IFNa or TNFa alone [40, 41]. Alter- natively, DC can be directly isolated from the blood, requiring no further in vitro differentiation. The numbers of DC obtainable this way may be low, and if derived from cancer patients, often carry functional abnormalities [42–44]. DC are very diverse and all the above methods generate DC with slightly different phenotypic and functional features. Monocyte-derived DC are most popular, probably because of the homogeneity and relatively stable phenotype of the cells. Immature DC, generated by any of these methods and loaded with antigens ex vivo, as discussed below, have to be matured, as only this would enable them to migrate to lymph nodes and present antigen to T cells. Early trials indicated that immature DC are unable to stimulate T cell responses and may even generate tumour-specific regulatory T cells [45]. However, the strength and complexity of the ex vivo provided maturation signal should be finely balanced, 372 Z. Tabi as the antigen-loaded DC, injected back into the patients, should be able to migrate to the lymph node but their full maturation should only occur within the lymph node, otherwise T cell priming will not take place. Maturation ex vivo is usually induced with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, such as PAMPs, alone or in combination, or with a mixture of cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-6, IL-1, prostaglandin-E, IFN-g, and CD40-ligand (CD40L) [46]. Some of these agents are capable of inducing full maturation, including the induction of IL-12 production, which is believed to be undesirable before DC reach their destination in vivo. A recently published ‘‘fast-DC’’ protocol, stimulating monocytes for only 2 days ex vivo in the presence of IFN-g and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reported tumour-peptide-specific responses (to Her/2b) and decreased tumour volumes in vaccinated breast cancer patients [47], the mechanism being dependent on a delayed IL-12 burst. Alternatively, maturation can be induced in vivo following administration of the antigen-loaded DC with systemically applied antibodies cross-linking stimulatory molecules on DC, such as anti-CD40 antibody [48]. 2.2.2 Antigen Loading In Vitro When antigen is loaded onto DC ex vivo, the choice of the optimal antigen is based on the following criteria: (1) expressed on the majority of tumour cells in most or all patients with the same type of tumour, (2) not expressed on healthy cells, (3) necessary for the maintenance of tumour growth, i.e. antigen escape mutants should not be viable, (4) able to induce robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against the tumour, and (5) immunogenic in several major MHC haplotypes. Alternatively, when tumour-cell lysates are loaded onto DC, the nature of antigen is not defined. The most frequently used approaches to load DC with tumour-cell antigens are listed below. Exogenous Antigens Tumour Cell Lysate: This method was used extensively in preclinical models and in clinical trials with some original success in selected melanoma patients [49], followed by mixed results in subsequent clinical trials. Recently it has been demonstrated that freeze-thawing does not mimic well in vivo tumour cell death, and cross-presentation of tumour material may not be efficient [50]. There are also some problems with the design of this approach: some tumours are not easily accessible, thus tumour material cannot be obtained. As the antigen repertoire is unknown, it is difficult to design efficient monitoring. Potential improvements include the introduction of treatments which would make tumour cell death more immunogenic. Originally, necrotic cell death was thought to be immunogenic while apoptotic was not. These categories are now being replaced by more sophisticated markers of immunogenicity, such as calreticulin surface expression and release of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1); a signal of tissue damage. The impact of applying inducers of Cancer Vaccines 373 immunogenic tumour cell death, such as anthracyclins, gamma irradiation or UVC-induced apoptosis [51, 52], to tumour cells before preparing the lysates has yet to be assessed in DC vaccines. Peptides, Proteins and Recombinant Proteins: Using whole tumour antigens has several advantages, the main one being that they are able to generate immune responses against unknown epitopes in any HLA type. However, as they have a rather limited availability at clinical grade, an easier approach is the use of overlapping peptides, spanning the entire length of proteins, synthesised at the required good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade. With the expanding library of new tumour antigens representing potential new or tested T cell epitopes, loading DC with known amounts of synthetic peptides became the most popular area of DC vaccine studies. The variation in the approaches include the use of poly- vs. single epitopes; a mixture of Class I- and Class II- restricted peptides vs. Class I-restricted peptides alone, and long peptides vs. short peptides. Objective clinical responses in up to 25% of patients were achieved in phase I/II clinical trials in melanoma, prostate, and bladder cancer patients with metastatic disease. The treatment resulted in long-term survivors (3/10) in a cohort of melanoma patients [53]. Patients who survived longer were those who mounted melanoma peptide-specific immunity to at least two mel- anoma peptides. The conclusion from early trials and preclinical experiments is that DC loaded with long peptides representing poly-epitopes, and including both Class I- and Class II-restricted epitopes are more efficient in generating T cell responses and objective clinical responses. A significant improvement on exogenously loaded antigens is represented by recombinant proteins which deliver DC stimulatory compounds together with the antigen. The best example is the vaccine Sipuleucel-T (APC8015), where DC are loaded ex vivo with a recombinant fusion protein, consisting of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to GM-CSF. This vaccine is under- going a phase III randomised placebo-controlled trial (discussed later). Endogenous Antigens The use of tumour-antigen-encoding cDNA or mRNA seems attractive as this approach provides unselected endogenous expression of tumour antigens in DC. As cDNA transfection of DC is very inefficient, this method is better suited for infection of DC with viral vectors expressing defined antigens. Loading tumour-derived mRNA has also been attempted, and optimisation of the method is ongoing [54, 55]. One of the advantages of the autologous tumour- derived mRNA approach is that it delivers antigen with the relevant mutations to DCs. Endogenous antigen presentation favours CD8+ T cell stimulation, which may result in the lack of stimulating CD4+ T helper responses, thus limiting the usefulness of the method. Another method to target DC is the docking of glycosylated tumour antigens alone or coupled to antibodies specific for C-type lectin receptors DEC-205 [56] or DC-SIGN [57]. 374 Z. Tabi 2.2.3 Delivery of DC Vaccines Depending on the site of injection of antigen-loaded DC, their homing pattern, and their ability to generate anti-tumour T cell responses varies. In prostate cancer, patients were injected with DC-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which were cultured for 2 days ex vivo, with recombinant mouse PAP intradermally (i.d.), intravenously (i.v.), or intralymphatically (i.l.) into lymphatic vessels in the feet. CD4+ T cell proliferative responses were primed by all three treatments; however, i.d. and i.l. vaccination routes were superior to the i.v. route in generating CTL responses [58]. These observations were con- firmed by other studies, making i.d. the most common route of DC vaccine administration. Direct administration into draining lymph nodes is also pro- mising but requires more technical skill. 2.3 Tumour Cell: DC Hybrids The fusion of irradiated tumour cells with DC generates immune responses which could eliminate established tumours in mice [59]. Functionally active fusions have also been generated using human cells. The fused cells express a broad array of tumour-associated antigens, including yet unidentified ones, and also deliver DC-mediated co-stimulatory signals. However, unless the tumour cells are autologous to the patient being vaccinated, there is a possibility of invoking a predominant response against allogeneic MHC molecules rather than tumour antigens. Fusion of DCs with breast carcinoma cells upregulates the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, maturation markers such as CCR7 and IL-12 [60]. Interestingly, the fused DC stimulate mixed T cell responses by activating both effector and regulatory T cells, where the effector responses are relatively weak. In this model, the presence of IL-12, IL-18, and a TLR 9 agonist skews the response towards effector T cell development. It should also be considered that although irradiated fused tumour cells are unable to divide, they can still produce immunosuppressive substances, such as TGF-b, which may impair DC function. In a preclinical model, specific targeting of TGF-b in the tumour environment by transfecting the tumour cells before their fusion with DC with an adenoviral vector encoding TGF-b-R interrupted TGF-b signalling and enhanced the efficacy of the fusion vaccine [61]. These results confirm the need for a multi-level approach when developing cancer vaccines. 3 Antigen Vaccines 3.1 Peptide- and Protein-Based Vaccines, Adjuvants Unlike cell-based vaccines, synthetic peptides are easy to obtain in large quan- tities at clinical grade. Peptide vaccines, injected with incomplete Freund’s Cancer Vaccines 375 adjuvant (IFA), can induce efficient T cell responses in mice to prevent pro- gression and metastasis of established tumours. The immunogenicity of peptide epitopes can be increased by amino acid modifications, which increase the binding affinity of the peptide to MHC molecules and generate more robust T cell responses cross-reacting with the wild-type sequence. These peptides with higher biological potency than wild-type sequences are called heteroclitic pep- tides. Successful modification of a MART-1 peptide [62], to generate cross- reactive T cells has been demonstrated in a small cohort of melanoma patients. Inclusion of Class II-restricted peptides, especially in the form of physical linking of Class I- and Class II-restricted epitopes from the same tumour antigen, further improves the antigenicity of peptide vaccines, probably by the simultaneous stimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. This has been demonstrated against NY-ESO-1 sequences in melanoma [63] and Her/ 2-sequences in breast and ovarian cancer [64]. Natural processing of long peptides may prevent the generation of cryptic epitopes, i.e. sequences which are not generated by natural processing of antigens. T cells specific against cryptic epitopes cannot recognise and kill tumour cells [65]. The limitation of peptide vaccines is due to strict MHC-restriction rules. For stimulation of T cells regardless of MHC Class I and Class II haplotypes, overlapping peptides, representing T cell epitope clusters, can be used [66]. Peptide vaccines need to be taken up and processed in vivo by DC. Peptides injected alone are unable to trigger DC maturation, and immature DC-present- ing antigen may generate T cell tolerance or regulatory T cells. Adjuvants, given simultaneously with the peptide vaccines, are needed to mature DC in vivo and also to induce cross-presentation of the antigen. In turn, these DC secure the generation of antigen-specific, long-lived effector T cells able to migrate to the tumour site. The combination of TLR agonists and CD40L applied together indeed had a synergistic effect to induce more potent CD8+ T cell responses in a CD4-independent manner [67]; but, the combination applied with a tumour vaccine did not lead to tumour eradication because T cells accumulated pri- marily in the draining lymph nodes and did not migrate to the tumour [66]. Covalent linking of a TLR agonist to a multiepitope peptide may result in the appropriate T cell stimulation, including tumour infiltration in vivo. Promising data have been obtained in experimental models, including covalent linking of a Her/2 CTL epitope and an influenza CD4+ T cell epitope followed by the conjugation of the peptides to the surface of liposomes via a Pam3CSS anchor, a synthetic lipopeptide with TLR2 agonist activity. Injection of mice with this construct has protected them against Her/2+ tumour challenge. More impor- tantly, in a therapeutic setting, treatment of established tumours with the liposomal vaccine resulted not only in delayed tumour growth but also in the complete rejection of tumours in 60% of animals [68]. Although recombinant proteins are more difficult to generate at a clinical grade, there are some promising early phase clinical trials. One example is vaccinating with recombinant NY-ESO-1, a cancer-testis antigen, of patients with cancers known to express NY-ESO-1. Recombinant NY-ESO-1 antigen 376 Z. Tabi co-injected with Montanide ISA-51 and the TLR-9-agonist CpG7909 in a water–oil emulsion subcutaneously in 18 patients generated specific IgG anti- bodies in all patients. The immune complexes aided the cross-presentation of antigen resulting in the stimulation of CD8+ T cell responses [69]. This approach can be further improved, such as with increased numbers of vaccina- tions, using multiple TLR agonists. 3.2 Recombinant Viral Vector Vaccines Recombinant cancer vaccines consist of tumour antigens encoded by viral vectors. This approach allows antigen to be delivered at a high concentration both endo- genously and for cross-presentation, while DC maturation signals are also pro- vided. Good viral vectors can accommodate one or more genes encoding tumour antigens and also co-stimulatory molecules. Several viruses can be considered as vectors for tumour antigens, such as vaccinia, fowlpox, canarypox, and adeno- virus. Immunological memory against some of these viruses can be limiting because of the presence of pre-existing antibodies with the ability to neutralise the recom- binant virus particles before they reach their destinations. Vaccinia is becoming an increasingly useful vector, as global immunisation with vaccinia ended in the 1980s. Phase I and II clinical trials demonstrated excellent safety and the generation of humoral and cellular immune responses, as summarised by Harrop [70]. One of the directions to improve clinical benefit is to include genes for co-stimulatory molecules, such as B7.1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3 (TRICOM) [71] together with that for tumour antigen. Furthermore, a prime-boost regime of vaccine delivery using two different recombinant viruses can also improve immunological results, as indicated by preclinical experiments. The reason behind this twofold: one is, that the antibody generated against the first vector may limit the efficacy of the same vector in a repeated application. The second is that a relatively larger number of T cells are activated by the viral part of the vaccine than by the tumour antigen in the ‘‘prime’’ vaccination. Use of a different vector ensures that only tumour-antigen-specific T cells are reacti- vated by the ‘‘boost’’ treatment. Although several early phase cancer vaccine trials have used this protocol, the clinical benefits are variable [72–78]. There is an obvious need to further improve the efficiency of viral vaccines which may be done via carefully designed combination with existing treatments and the inclusion of immune response modifiers. 4 Immune Response Modifiers Non-specific immune stimulation of cancer patients has been tried for many years. Typically, the adjuvant is injected at the site of the tumour followed by a massive activation of macrophages and release of inflammatory cytokines. Cancer Vaccines 377 These may break immunological tolerance and initiate an avalanche of immu- nological events which lead to the attack of the tumour cell by the immune system. 4.1 Adjuvants BCG: Superficial bladder cancer can be effectively treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy, by reducing tumour recurrence, disease progression, and mortality. The treatment induces inflam- mation of the bladder with infiltration of a broad range of cells such as macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and NK cells. Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2 and IL-6, IFNg,and TNFa, can be measured in the urine for many hours after treatment. The adjuvant effect is likely to be mediated by TLR signalling, especially via TLR2 and TLR4. Montanides: Montanides are a group of oil/surfactant based adjuvants in which different surfactants are combined with a non-metabolisable mineral oil, a metabolisable oil, or a mixture of the two. They are prepared for use as an emulsion with aqueous antigen solution. The surfactant for e.g. Montanide ISA 50 (ISA = Incomplete Seppic Adjuvant) is mannide oleate, a major component of the surfactant in Freund’s adjuvants. The various Montanide ISA group of adjuvants are used as water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, or water- in-oil-in-water emulsions. CpG-ODN: Synthetic oligodeoxynucelotides (ODN) containing CpG motifs stimulate cells via TLR9. The stimulatory effect is due to mimicking bacterial DNA which is rich in unmethylated CpG sequences, while in mammalian DNA these sequences are rare and methylated. In man, TLR9 is expressed on plas- macytoid DC and B cells, while in mice it is also expressed on myeloid DC and monocytes. CpG-ODN activate both innate and adaptive immune responses, stimulate Th1-type immune responses, mature DC, and induce CTL responses. They promote IFN-a and TNF-a production. In melanoma patients, enhanced CD8+ T cell responses were observed in vaccine + CpG-ODN recipients, but the outcome was not affected. Interestingly, CpG-ODN can protect immune cells from the damaging effects of chemo- and radiotherapy. Iscomatrix: Immunostimulatory complex of a purified saponin fraction, cholesterol and phospholipid, which under defined conditions form cage-like structures typically 40 nm in diameter. The principal advantage of this combi- nation is the reduction of toxicity of saponin component. Iscomatrix particulate vaccines are likely to be phagocytosed by macophages and induce cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-g. They have a significant potential in cancer vaccine development [79]. MPL (monophosphoryl lipid A): Although the effectiveness of LPS as an immunomodulator has long been known, the pharmacologic use of purified LPS (or lipid A) as an adjuvant is precluded by its toxicity. LPS is highly 378 Z. Tabi pyrogenic and promotes systemic inflammatory response syndrome. MPL comprises the lipid A portion of LPS from which the (R)-3-hydroxytetradeca- noyl group and the 1-phosphate have been removed by successive acid and base hydrolysis in an effort to uncouple the immunomodulatory effects of lipid A from its toxicity. LPS and MPL induce similar cytokine profiles, but MPL is at least 100-fold less toxic. Several vaccines containing MPL have been approved, including an HPV vaccine in Australia and a hepatitis B vaccine in Europe. 4.2 Cytokines Cytokines behave as messengers in the immune system. They are secreted by immune cells and can act in an autocrine or a paracrine fashion, functioning either locally or at a distance to modulate immune responses. In cancer therapy, cytokines are often used to enhance immunity. IL-2 is primarily a T cell growth factor, but its receptor is also expressed on B cells and NK cells. IL-2, when administered in high doses, increases the number of T cells, B cells, and NK cells in the blood, the activity of NK cells, and the serum levels of TNFa,IL-1b, and IFN-g. Furthermore, IL-2 has been shown to preferentially expand Treg cells which can suppress effector T cells, preventing them from killing tumour cells. IL-2 is approved for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer and metastatic melanoma. High-dose IL-2 treatment requires close monitoring because of toxic side effects such as capillary leak syndrome and subsequent severe hypotension. There are attempts to modify the IL-2 molecule, such as by amino acid replacements, in order to preserve its biological activity without the toxicity. IFN-a has an antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic effect on tumour cells, upregulates tumour antigens, increases the lytic capacity of NK cells and the expression of MHC Class I molecules on various cell types. It is a powerful activator of a wide range of immune cells. IFNa is approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma. High-dose IFN-a applied to resected Stage 3 and 2B melanoma patients results in disease-free and overall survival benefits, including some long-term survivors. Its side effects include depression, lack of energy, and dehydration. IFN-g is known to increase the expression of MHC Class I and II, adhesion molecules, and molecules associated with antigen processing, as well as activate macrophages, NK cells, T cells, and DC. Although its systemic application seemed promising in metastatic carcinoma, its significant toxicity has limited its widespread use. Current approaches, such as gene transfection or liposomal application, achieve stable and high local concentrations in the tumour envir- onment without inducing side effects. GM-CSF stimulates the maturation of granulocyte precursors and the devel- opment of monocytes and dendritic cells. It is approved in stem cell and bone marrow transplant patients to reconstitute granulocytes and myeloid cells. Its Cancer Vaccines 379 main application in cancer treatment is not necessarily the induction of anti- tumour immune responses but the shortening of the period of time a patient is neutropenic after chemotherapy. However, its effect as an immunotherapeutic agent needs to be evaluated. 4.3 Antibodies and Ligands with Immunological Targets Ontak or denileukin diftitox: A recombinant IL-2 – diphteria-toxin (DT) fusion protein. It binds to cells expressing high-affinity IL-2R (CD25). The fusion protein is internalised via receptor-mediated endocytosis and proteolytically cleaved within the endosome, liberating the enzymatically active portion of the DT, the A fragment. DT fragment A is released into the cytosol-inhibiting protein synthesis and leading to cell death. In vivo treatment with Ontak depletes Treg cells significantly, resulting in enhanced Th1-type immune responses and substantial development of antigen-specific CD8 T cells upon vaccination. Antagonistic CTLA-4 antibody: CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activating factor-4) is a CD28-family protein and a powerful negative regulator of T cell responses. B7-1 and B7-2 molecules, present on DC, serve as ligands for both CD28 co-stimulatory molecules and CTLA-4 inhibitory molecules on T cells. In association with T cell receptor binding of peptide antigen presented on MHC molecules, signal by CD28 binding provides a co-stimulatory signal for T cells, whereas CTLA-4 triggers inhibition of T cell function (Fig. 3). CTLA-4 block- ade by antibodies attenuates the negative signal and thus promotes T cell proliferation and effector function. In mice, antibodies to CTLA-4 can promote tumour rejection and tumour immunity. Anti-tumour activity has been observed in metastatic melanoma [80] and other malignancies after treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, as well as the potential for autoimmune-related toxicities. Recombinant CD40L: CD40L is expressed on activated T cells. CD40 is a cell surface molecule expressed on B cells, monocytes, and DC, a member of the TNFR superfamily. CD40 signalling is a strong inducer of DC maturation, stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. CD40–CD40L inter- action, representing ‘‘T cell help’’, enables DC to undergo full maturation and stimulate primary anti-tumour T cell responses. Apart from this indirect effect, \u000270% of solid tumours also express CD40, and a direct trigger of tumour cell apoptosis by a poorly understood mechanism has also been implied. CD40L administered to patients as a soluble protein or as trimers is undergoing phase I trials [81]. CD40-directed agonistic antibodies have also been evaluated in preclinical models (Fig. 3). The combination of anti-CD40 agonist antibody with chemotherapy cures established implanted tumours and protects from re- challenge with the same tumour. 380 Z. Tabi 5 Combination of Cancer Vaccines with Chemo- and Radiotherapy Cancer vaccine trials are often conducted in advanced patients resistant to conventional treatments such as chemo- or radiotherapy. Although early treat- ment with immune therapy is not likely to happen soon, well-designed combi- nations of established treatments with immune therapy would be an important step towards achieving the full potential of cancer vaccines. 5.1 Combined Chemo-immunotherapy Chemotherapy (CT), using cytotoxic agents, destroys dividing cells in a non- specific manner, resulting in a mainly apoptotic elimination of all rapidly A B C Fig. 3 Boosting DC–T cell interaction by monoclonal antibodies.(A)CD4+Tcellsrequire MHC+ peptide and TCR interaction (signal 1) and co-stimulation via B7-1, -2, and CD28 interaction (signal 2). CD40L and CD40 interaction delivers a maturation signal for DC and enables them to stimulate CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cell activity is downregulated by B7-1,-2 and CTLA-4 interaction. (B) T cell stimulation can be improved by switching off CTLA-4 using an antagonis- ing anti-CTLA-4 antibody. This enhances positive co-stimulation via CD28 signalling. (C)DC maturation can be boosted in vivo by injecting synthetic CD40L or agonising anti-CD40 antibody as shown. These DC are able to prime naive CD8+ T cells even in the absence of T cell help Cancer Vaccines 381 dividing cells. The long-held belief that CT is detrimental for not only the tumour but also the cells of the immune system is not supported by the latest results studying the activation and functional status of T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumour-draining lymph nodes during CT [82, 83]. CT can crucially influence the survival and behaviour of immune cells at multiple levels: (1) Tumour cells killed by CT provide a wide range of tumour- associated antigens (TAA) for the immune system. (2) Depending on the type of CT, TAA uptake can happen in an immunogenic or a non-immunogenic way. (3) CT can remove immune inhibitory cells or effects produced by tumour cells. (4) CT generates lymphopenia, which creates ‘‘space’’ for tumour-specific T cells to expand and removes competition for important inflammatory cytokines. A more detailed analysis of these immunologically beneficial effects of CT, waiting to be exploited in combined immunological approaches, is discussed below. Antigen release following CT-induced tumour cell death: Whatever the type of tumour cell death following CT, it is certain that a huge amount of TAA is released from the affected cells. In mice, antigen-presenting cells carrying TAA accumulate in draining lymph nodes following CT. High concentration of exogenous antigen can be cross-presented by DC to CD8+ T cells, so TAA released following CT is expected to favour this type of antigen presentation. The nature of TAA is also interesting, as important, but yet unknown, tumour antigens including tumour-rejection antigens may be released and thus this mix of TAA represents the most complete and relevant array of antigens for immune recognition in an autologous manner. The type of tumour cell death: CT of bulky solid tumours results mainly in apoptotic cell death but non-apoptotic mechanisms, such as necrosis, autop- hagy, and mitotic catastrophe also occur, as reviewed by Okada [84]. Apoptotic cells are normally not immunogenic when taken up by macrophages or DC. However, regardless the mode of CT-induced cell death, when it happens on a massive scale and in a highly synchronised manner, the anti-inflammatory default mechanism to clear these cells may easily be overwhelmed. Accumula- tion of monocytes, B cells, DC, and macrophages occurs at the site of tumour cell death, and beside the huge amount and range of TAA taken up by these cells, it is expected that heat shock proteins and HMGB1 (from cells that die by apoptosis) are also released. These molecules represent damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) which serve as adjuvants to initiate DC matura- tion. Based simply on this quantitative argument, it would be expected that TAA-specific T cell responses are generated in the draining lymph nodes following CT. An improved definition of immunogenic cell death may enable us to exploit better the wave of CT-induced tumour cell death for immune therapies. The question of immunogenic vs. non-immunogenic cell death focused for a long time simply on the difference between apoptotic vs. necrotic cell death, without definitive conclusions. It seems now that the key to immu- nogenic cell death is the translocation of certain, normally intracellular, mole- cules on the cell surface during apoptosis. Calreticulin has been indicated as 382 Z. Tabi such a molecule, and its cell surface expression can be induced by anthracyclins, g-irradiation, and UVC light [51, 52]. Anthracyclins inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis by intercalating between base pairs of the DNA/RNA strand, thus preventing the replication of cancer cells. They are used to treat a wide range of cancers, including breast, uterine, ovarian, and lung cancers, so it is feasible to consider them for the design of combination chemo-immunotherapy. Removal of tumour-associated immunosuppressive effects by CT: As most tumours produce TGFb, IL-10, IL-6, and growth factors, it can be expected that simply by decreasing the tumour burden, the level of these inhibitory factors will fall. Standard, platinum-based chemotherapy of ovarian cancer patients decreases the level of Ca125 systemically. Ca125 itself has suppressive effects on NK and maybe on other cell types. Indeed, CT in these patients was associated with improved T cell responses [83]. A similar effect may be respon- sible for the immune stimulation observed in pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine. In these patients, there was no decrease in the proportion of Treg cells, but the numbers of T cells producing IFN-g and expressing CD69 increased [85]. Gemcitabine also stimulated TNF-a and IL-2 production in a small group of lung cancer patients, reviewed by Nowak et al. [86]. CT-induced lymphopenia: Earlier in this chapter we discussed the beneficial effects of lymphodepleting chemotherapies for generating a more favourable environment for adoptive T cell transfer. All chemotherapy, not only lympho- depleting drugs, is associated with a certain level of lymphopenia as a side effect which, in the treatment of solid tumours, is usually not symptomatic. The altered immune cell composition in the tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes, or even in the blood during treatment with different agents, has not been studied in a systematic manner. Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine have confirmed anti-Treg cell properties in the circulation [87–89], but little is known about the effect of these and other drugs on other inhibitory cell subsets such as myeloid suppressor cells or tolerogenic DC. It is important to deter- mine if routine chemotherapy regimes are adequate to eliminate inhibitory cell types or if a specific combination of drugs should be used to achieve this in chemo-immunotherapy approaches. Chemo-immunotherapy in the clinic: Combination of standard chemotherapy with therapeutic vaccines or non-specific immune therapy is being tested pre- sently in cancer patients. They are in early phases with small numbers of patients, so it is not yet possible to draw conclusions about efficacy. 5.2 Combined Radio-immunotherapy Radiation therapy (RT) is a successful therapeutic approach in cancer treat- ment. Besides its cytotoxic effects on tumour cells, RT also has immunomodu- latory effects. The ability of peripheral blood T cells to proliferate to PPD (purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis) was impaired in Cancer Vaccines 383 breast cancer patients 45 days after finishing RT [90], and impaired mitogen- induced proliferation was also observed in cervical cancer patients on the last day of receiving 25 fractions of pelvic RT [91]. T cell receptor cross-linking by CD3–CD28 antibody coated beads also revealed proliferative impairment of T cells in prostate cancer patients (Fig. 4). On the other hand, sublethal irradia- tion of the tumour in vitro or in vivo is considered immunostimulatory as it upregulates MHC Class I, ICAM-1 and Fas molecules, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, PECAM-1, and VCAM-1), and heat shock proteins; stimulates IFN-g secretion; facilitates the migration of CD8 T cells to the irradiated tissue; and makes tumour cells more susceptible to T cell-mediated killing [92–94]. The mechanism behind the inhibition of distant tumours after local RT, called abscopal effect, is little understood, but accumulating evidence points towards immunological effector function. RT is known to cause immunogenic tumour cell death, releasing not only tumour antigens but also DAMPs, such as HMGB1, which signal tissue injury and contribute to the cross-presentation of tumour-associated antigens [95]. Standard therapies have been shown to initiate immune responses in prostate cancer patients, demonstrated by antibody Fig. 4 Radiation therapy impairs T cell proliferative capacity in prostate cancer patients. PBMC were isolated from peripheral blood of patients undergoing a total of 20 fractions of localised pelvic and lymph node radiation therapy for the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer. Samples were collected before the first fraction of RT, after 20 fractions, and 4 weeks after the patients received the last cycle of RT. PBMC were stimulated in vitro with CD3–CD28 T cell expander beads (Dynal) at 2\u0003105 cells per well for 3 days. 3H-thimidine was added to the cells for the last 12 h of culture, and isotope uptake was measured by a Wallace Betaplate counter. The results are expressed as mean 3H-thymidine uptake from triplicate cultures. Each line represents T cell proliferation data from an individual patient. After 20 fractions of RT, T cells from each patient displayed impaired proliferative ability 384 Z. Tabi production against tumour-associated antigens after androgen deprivation therapy, followed by further enhancement of these antibody titres by RT [96]. Thus it seems that localised RT exerts a complex effect both on the tumour and on the bystander cells, including lymphocytes, which may critically influence cellular immune responses. Results of preclinical models and clinical trials indicate that certain combi- nations of immunotherapy and radiotherapy can achieve synergistic effects with potential clinical benefit. Synthetic CpG oligonucleotides (TLR9 ago- nists) dramatically enhance the effect of single-dose or fractionated radio- therapy in a mouse model [97]. The combination not only increased tumour response but also generated memory responses protecting from re-challenge. Localised irradiation of a subcutaneous, carcioembryonic antigen (CEA)- expressing tumour, in combination with the CEA-encoding TRICOM vaccine induced significant CD8+ T cell influx into the tumour with subsequent arrest of tumour growth [92]. In the first clinical trial combining external beam RT with a vaccine, prostate cancer patients received a poxviral vaccine, encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA), three times monthly before RT [98]. This treatment resulted not only in increased levels of PSA-specific T cell responses but also caused epitope spreading, indicating the presence of active anti-tumour immune responses. The trial also indicated that local radiother- apy does not have a negative effect on vaccine-induced PSA-specific T cell responses, which might be explained by preferential resistance of memory cells to RT [99]. 6 Ongoing Phase III Cancer Immunotherapy Trials 6.1 Cancer Vaccines 6.1.1 Sipuleucel-T (APC8015) Sipuleucel is made by Dendreon Corp. (Seattle, WA). It is a vaccine for patients with hormone-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. Peripheral blood collected from patients by leukapheresis is enriched for CD54+ cells (monocytes and DC) and loaded ex vivo with a fusion protein consisting of PAP and GM-CSF. The antigen is targeted to GMCSF-R+ antigen-presenting cells via the fusion partner, GM-CSF [100]. Promising early phase trials indicated beneficial effects by reduced PSA levels and prolonged time to progression (TTP) in patients with anti-PAP immune responses [101]. The first phase III clinical trial shows a significant positive effect on overall survival (OS) but not on TTP which was the primary endpoint of the trial. In order to obtain FDA approval, the trial has been extended to study Sipuleucel’s effect in 500 patients. The survival data from this study are expected by 2010. Cancer Vaccines 385 6.1.2 Stimuvax Stimuvax1 (L-BLP25) is a vaccine developed in Europe by Merck KGaA and in the United States by its affiliate, EMD Serono Inc. Stimuvax is a liposome vaccine, targeting non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with unresect- able stage IIIB tumour. The major component of Stimuvax is the synthetic human MUC-1 protein, consisting of a 20-amino acid tandem repeat sequence on its extracellular domain. MUC-1 is expressed on normal epithelial as well as on tumour cells, but on tumours it is abnormally glycosylated. The vaccine also contains an adjuvant (MPL; monophosphoryl lipid A) and both are enclosed in a liposomal vehicle. Randomised phase II trials indicated improved survival in patients at 3 years in the Stimuvax arm (49%) compared to best supportive care alone (27%). In the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB disease, a 17.3 month difference in median survival compared to patients receiving best supportive care alone (30.6 months vs. 13.3 months respectively) was observed [102]. Side effects were mild to moderate, such as flu-like symptoms, gastro-intestinal and mild injection site reactions. Based on these phase II results, Stimuvax has entered its phase III development, and the START (Stimulating Targeted Antigenic Responses to NSCLC) trial is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate patients with documented unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC who have had a response or stable disease after at least two cycles of platinum-based chemo-radiotherapy. The study will involve more than 1,300 patients in approximately 30 countries. Treatment administered will consist of a single i.v. dose of 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide followed by 8-weekly subcu- taneous immunisations with Stimuvax. Maintenance immunisations will then be given at 6-week intervals. One of the potential benefits of Stimuvax is that the MUC-1 protein is not specific for lung; it is also expressed on breast, colon, and prostate tumours. An early phase trial has already been reported in prostate cancer [103]. 6.1.3 TroVax TroVax1 is Oxford BioMedica’s therapeutic cancer vaccine, consisting of the 5T4 antigen [104] encoded by a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus. Early phase clinical trials reported potent CD4+ T cell and antibody responses in colorectal and prostate cancer patients [105, 106]. Time to progression was significantly longer in patients who developed 5T4-specific cellular responses compared with those who did not (5.6 vs. 2.3 months, respectively). However, there were no objective clinical responses. TRIST (by Sanofi-Aventis) is a phase III clinical trial of TroVax in renal cell carcinoma, taking place across approximately 120 centres in the USA and Western and Eastern Europe. Trovax is administered in combinations with IL-2, IFN-a, and sunitinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) to combat advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma to 700 patients, with the primary endpoint being 386 Z. Tabi the rate of overall survival. It is hoped that TroVax will prove to be effective against a wide range of cancers. Phase III trials are also planned in colorectal and breast cancer. 6.1.4 Prostvac (TM) For the potential treatment of prostate cancer, Bavarian Nordic is developing PROSTVAC-VF-TRICOM, a prime-boost vaccine regimen that consists of a priming injection with a recombinant attenuated vaccinia virus expressing PSA and triad of co-stimulatory molecules (TRICOM: ICAM-1, B7.1, and LFA-3) and a booster injection with a fowlpox virus expressing the same combination. In clinical trials to date, Prostvac(TM) has been investigated in 464 patients over 10 years. The results from the latest phase II prospective randomised placebo-controlled study of 125 patients with advanced prostate cancer after 4 years of follow-up show that patients receiving Prostvac(TM) had a statisti- cally significantly longer median overall survival by 8.5 months (p=0.015) compared to the control group [71, 107]. In addition, it also had a favourable safety and tolerability profile. Based on these promising results, Bavarian Nordic together with the National Cancer Institute expects to initiate phase III studies for Prostvac(TM) for the approval of this therapy. 6.1.5 GVAX GVAX has been developed by Cell Genesys, Inc. for the treatment of sympto- matic hormone-refractory advanced prostate cancer. The vaccine consists of two allogeneic tumour cell lines transfected with an adenoviral vector encoding GM-CSF. Early phase studies with different doses of the vaccine achieved median survival of 34.9 months after treatment with the high dose of immunotherapy and 24.0 months with the low dose. Radiation therapy alone resulted in a median survival of 26.2 months. The median time to bone scan progression in the radiation therapy group was 5.0 months with the high dose and 2.8 months with the low dose. In the rising-PSA group receiving the low dose, the median time to bone scan progression was 5.9 months and median survival was 37.5 months. No dose-limiting or autoimmune toxicities were seen; the most com- mon adverse events were injection site reaction and fatigue. Ongoing phase III trials (VITAL-1 and VITAL-2) were comparing GVAX + Taxotere with Taxotere + Prednisone in randomised, blinded. The primary endpoint was improved overall survival. Both trials have recently been halted. In September 2008 VITAL-2, which has enrolled 408 patients, has been halted because of the high proportion of deaths in patients receiving the vaccine (67 patients) compared with those in the control arm (47 patients). In October 2008 VITAL-1, which has recruited 626 patients has also been terminated on the advise of the study’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee which indicated Cancer Vaccines 387 that the trial had less than a 30% chance of meeting its predefined primary endpoint of an improvement in survival. 6.1.6 Lucanix NovaRx Corp. launched a study of therapeutic vaccine LucanixTM (belagenpumatucel-L) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Belagenpumatucel-L is a TGF-b2 antisense gene-modified allogeneic tumour cell vaccine that demonstrates enhancement of tumour-antigen recognition as a result of TGF-b2 inhibition. In a phase II trial, 75 patients (stages II–IV) received a total of 550 vaccinations as monthly i.d. injections of Lucanix. No significant adverse events were observed. A dose-related survival difference was demonstrated in patients who received more or at least 2.5 \u0003 107 cells/injection. In late-stage (IIIB and IV, n=61) patients, a 15% partial response rate was achieved. The estimated probabilities of surviving 1 and 2 years were 68% and 52%, respectively, for the higher dose groups combined and 39% and 20%, respectively, for the low-dose group. Immune function was explored in the 61 advanced-stage (IIIB and IV) patients. Increased cytokine production (IFN-g, IL-6, IL-4) at week 12, compared with patients with progressive disease, was observed among clinical responders. Furthermore, positive T cell responses to belagenpumatucel-L showed a correlation trend with clinical responsiveness in patients achieving stable disease or better [108]. Phase II results showed that 50% of patients with stable disease who received Lucanix after one front-line regimen of chemotherapy lived for more than 44 months vs. fewer than for 10–12 months for those receiving standard care. Patients receiving Lucanix after zero to five prior chemo-treatments had a 1-year survival of 61% and a 2-year survival of 41%, a striking improvement for late-stage patients, who typically have a 1-year survival rate of less than 30%. The phase III trial is designated as STOP for its expected endpoints – survival, tumour-free survival, overall survival, and progression-free survival, where overall survival is the primary endpoint. It is expected to enroll up to 700 patients with advanced-stage disease who have been treated with at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients will be randomised to receive Lucanix or placebo, administered i.d., once monthly for 18 months and then once at 21 months and at 24 months. 6.1.7 Telovac (GV1001) Pharmexa’s Telovax is a telomerase peptide vaccine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Telomerase is a common tumour antigen overexpressed in most tumour types and, importantly, recent studies suggest that tumour stem cells are also telomerase positive [109]. As telomerase is important in the maintenance of telomeres and replicative immortality, it is expected that tumours cannot develop resistance to telomerase-based therapies. 388 Z. Tabi Early phase trials targeting the catalytic component of telomerase, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) with peptides, mRNA, plasmid, or viral DNA established that TERT-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses can be generated. Anti-tumour effects were demonstrated against a wide range of tumours [110]. Pharmexa has shown in phase II trials that patients receiving GV1001 had a median lifetime of 8.6 months vs. 5 months for those on standard chemotherapy. Telovac is 16-mer peptide which can be presented by multiple MHC Class II and also processed into Class I epitopes. Patients receive the vaccine in two combinations with gemcitabine and capecitabine chemotherapy, either together with chemotherapy for 8 weeks or starting 1 week after chemotherapy (in week 9). GM-CSF is coinjected with the vaccine. The primary endpoint is survival at 12 months. The aim is to enroll 1,100 patients. 6.2 Biological Therapies 6.2.1 Oncophage In April 2008, Oncophage 1 (vitespen; formerly HSPPC-96) was approved in Russia for the treatment of kidney cancer patients at intermediate risk for disease recurrence. The company, Antigenics, expects to submit to the European Regulatory Agency before the end of 2008. Oncophage is a vaccine made from individual patients’ tumour. Patients have surgery to remove part or all of the cancerous tissue, which is used to isolate heat shock protein gp96 and its associated peptides. The complexes are extracted and purified from each sample, then sterilely filtered and placed into vials. More than 750 cancer patients in more than a dozen clinical trials around the world have received Oncophage. Many of these patients had advanced disease, including kidney cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer, and had not responded to traditional cancer treatments. Oncophage has also been evaluated in two international phase III trials in kidney cancer and metastatic melanoma, as well as studies in several other cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer. Data from Antigenics’ phase III trial of Oncophage in kidney cancer showed a 45% improvement in recurrence-free survival associated with Oncophage in a well-defined subgroup of earlier stage (better-prognosis) patients, although a significant improvement was not observed in the overall patient population [111]. In a phase III study of Oncophage in metastatic melanoma, overall median survival was 29% longer in patients who received at least 10 injections of Oncophage compared with physician’s choice regimen. Patients in the M1a and M1b substages receiving a larger number of immunisations survived longer than those receiving fewer treatments. The results suggest that patients with Cancer Vaccines 389 less-advanced disease who are able to receive 10 or more treatments are a promising candidate population [112]. 6.2.2 Ipilimumab Ipilimumab, a fully humanised monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4 on CD4+ T cells, is undergoing phase III trials in advanced melanoma patients. The trials are conducted by Medarex and Bristol Myers Squibb. One placebo- controlled monotherapy trial targets patients with fully resected stage III mela- noma, another trial is comparing the effect of chemotherapy (Dacarbazine) and Ipilimumab with chemotherapy alone, while the third one is combining a gp100 peptide vaccine with Ipilimumab in HLA-A2 + melanoma patients. Pfizer’s phase III anti-CTLA-4 antibody (Tremelimumab) trial has recently been halted as no beneficial effect over chemotherapy alone has been observed. The safety profile of the antibody is also a problem, as it may cause rash, diarrhoea, hepatitis, bowel inflammation, loss of pituitary hormone function, and hypothyroidism. 7 Summary The website http://ClinicalTrials.gov contains the most complete and regularly updated list of ongoing cancer vaccine clinical trials. At the time of writing this chapter, cancer vaccines are represented by 782 entries in the database (includ- ing hematologic malignancies), 292 of which are open trials. This indicates a continued interest in cancer vaccines, possibly encouraged by some of the obvious successes, such as ACT, which clearly demonstrate the enormous power of the immune system to combat cancer. The design of cancer vaccines, which utilise the patients’ own immune system ultimately to recognise and destroy cancer cells without serious side effects, is progressing with every single trial. Earlier attempts with single agents failed, as vaccine-induced immune responses did not translate into clinical responses, but ongoing and future trials are built on the lessons learned. Interesting features of immune therapies, which showed clinical benefit, are that tumour responses are often delayed, and the treatment may only stabilise the disease rather than leading to tumour regression. These features should be considered when design- ing primary endpoints. One area which has received relatively little attention in past clinical trials is how to neutralise the complex immunosuppressive net- works in cancer. This problem is addressed now by several ongoing trials. There is also a growing interest in combination therapies, where immunotherapy is applied as an adjuvant to traditional treatments. Also, combination of different immunotherapies, or co-application with biological response modifiers, opens new avenues for investigation. There is hope of achieving not only additive but synergistic effects with well-designed new treatments. 390 Z. Tabi The ultimate aim of cancer immunologists, to make cancer vaccines part of standard of care in oncology, is firmly on the way to becoming a reality.

Cancer Vaccines 397 RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy Kun Cheng and Bin Qin 1 Introduction Evolved as a defense mechanism against RNA virus, RNA interference (RNAi) is the phenomenon in which small interfering RNA (siRNA) of 21–23 nucleotides in length silences the target gene by binding to its complementary mRNA and triggering the degradation of target mRNA [1]. It was first found in Caenorhab- ditis elegans that introduction of foreign small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can lead to potent degradation of the complementary mRNA [2]. This finding generated huge interest in the application of siRNA for the biomedical research community. Potent knockdown of the target gene with high sequence specificity makes RNAi a powerful tool to uncover gene functions, understand the effects of selective gene silencing, and explore potential therapeutics for complex diseases [3]. The discovery of RNAi is one of the most dramatic findings over the past decade in the field of molecular biology [4]. As illustrated by the histogram in Fig. 1, the number of publications related to ‘‘RNAi’’ increased dramatically from 5 in1998toover2000in2007. Over the past two decades, the idea of developing novel therapeutics target- ing disease at the molecular level using gene modulation approach has attracted great attention [5]. The advances in molecular and cell biology, especially the completion of human genome project in 2003, have led to elucidation of the molecular pathological mechanisms underlying malignant transformation of various cancers. As a result, it brings new opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches, such as gene modulation. Gene targeted therapeutics is an effective strategy for a broad range of cancers because (i) different tumor types share a relatively small number of deficient pathways; (ii) drugs targeting a particular gene may be effective in treating tumor with a mutation of the target gene as well as any upstream genes of the target and (iii) many strategies are available to develop gene therapeutics once a target disease gene is identified [2]. K. Cheng (*) Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA e-mail: chengkun@umkc.edu Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_13, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 399 Thus far, 66.5% of gene therapy clinical trials aimed at the treatment of cancer [6]. Among all gene modulation approaches, RNAi is the most revolu- tionized and promising method for treating cancer. The RNAi technology has moved remarkably toward therapeutic application and there are already 12 ongoing clinical trials using siRNA (www.clinicaltrial.gov). Furthermore, RNAi holds great promises in cancer research because the inactivation of oncogenes could block or reverse the tumorigenesis, whereas silencing of tumor suppressor genes contributes to the better understanding of tumorigen- esis [7]. On the other hand, many large pharmaceutical companies showed great interest and have begun to invest in developing RNAi-based drugs for various diseases. This will further drive the transformation of RNAi toward therapeutic products [6]. In this chapter, we will highlight the RNAi mechanism, utility of RNAi in screening oncogenes, and cancer-associated genes involved in different cellular pathways. We will also discuss the challenges in developing siRNA therapeu- tics, as well as the targeted delivery of siRNA. 2 RNA Interference Mechanism and Limitations for In Vivo Application 2.1 Mechanism of RNAi The silencing process of siRNA is an ATP-dependent and post-transcriptional event occurred in the cytoplasm.

Cheng and B. Qin model is shown in Fig. 2. RNAi can be trigged by vector-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA), long dsRNA, or synthetic siRNA. In the RNAi process, the long dsRNA and shRNA are cleaved by the endogenous enzyme, dicer, into fragments of 21–23 nucleotide in length with a two-nucleotide 30-overhang. The short siRNA is then unwound by an ATP-dependent helicase and the antisense strand is incorporated into a multiprotein, RISC, which is the key step in RNAi. Subsequently, the incorporated antisense strand guides the RISC to its homo- logous mRNA for endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA [8, 9]. It is note- worthy that only one of the strands from siRNA is incorporated into the RISC, whereas many scientists previously believed that the whole duplex was incor- porated. The stability at the 50 end of the two strands determines which strand enters RISC, and the strand with the less-stable 50 end is more likely to be incorporated. To be functional against target mRNA, the antisense strand must be the one incorporated into the RISC [10].

The siRNA is then unwound by an ATP-dependent helicase and the antisense strand is incorporated into a multiprotein, RISC, which is the key step in RNAi. Subsequently, the incorporated antisense strand guides the RISC to its homo- logous targeted mRNA for the endonucleolytic cleavage RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 401 2.2 siRNA Design The design of siRNA sequences for a target gene is the first critical step in its therapeutic applications. Bearing in mind the complexities of the RNAi mechanism, designing siRNA has to be conducted very cautiously to achieve potent silencing effect while minimize off-target effects [5, 11]. So far, there are no universally accepted rules or softwares to design siRNAs, instead, numerous online siRNA design tools are available through academic institutions and commercial siRNA suppliers (Table 1). Each software uses different rational design algorithms and the optimal sequence needs to be determined experimen- tally by comparing silencing effect of several candidates [5, 9]. Nevertheless, many studies have been done to summarize the designing criteria, such as sequence length, G/C content and localization of target sequence within the mRNA [12–17]. Based on the molecular mechanism of RISC assembly, Ui-Tei et al. proposed four practical guidelines: (i) A/U at the 50 end of the antisense strand; (ii) G/C at the 50 end of the sense strand; (iii) at least five A/U residues in the 50 terminal of the antisense strand; and (iv) the absence of GC stretch of >9 nt in length [13]. To identify siRNA-specific features related to its activity, Khvorova et al. performed a systematic analysis Table 1 Online siRNA design tools Name of program Provider URL RNAi OligoRetriever Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories http://katahdin.cshl.org:9331/RNAi/ html/rnai.html RNAxs University of Vienna http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ RNAxs DEQOR Scionics Computer Innovation http://cluster-1.mpi-cbg.de/Deqor/ deqor.html siRNA Selection Program Whitehead Institute http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bioc/siRNAext siRNA Selector The Wistar Institute http://bioinfo.wistar.upenn.edu/ siRNA/siRNA.htm sIR: siRNA Information Resource University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center http://biotools.swmed.edu/siRNA/ siRNA Target Finder Ambion, Inc. http://www.ambion.com/techlib/ misc/siRNA_finder.html siDESIGN1 Center Dharmacon Research, Inc. http://www.dharmacon.com/ DesignCenter/ DesignCenterPage.aspx BLOCK-iTTM RNAi Designer Invitrogen, Inc. https://rnaidesigner.invitrogen.com/ rnaiexpress/ BIOPREDsi Qiagen Sciences Inc. http://www.biopredsi.org/start.html siRNA Target Finder Gen script corporation https://www.genscript.com/ssl-bin/ app/rnai 402 K. Cheng and B. Qin of 180 siRNAs targeting every other positions of two different mRNAs and summarized three important criteria for siRNA design: moderate or low G/C content (30\u000252%), low internal stability at the 50 antisense-end, and lack of internal repeats. In addition, three sense strand base preferences were revealed: (i) presence of an A at position 3 and 19 in the sense strand; (ii) presence of a U in position 10 of the sense strand; (iii) absence of a G or C at position 19, and a G at position 13 of the sense strand [12]. Considering the fact that high internal stability prevents efficient unwinding, low internal stability of the sense 30 end and the overall low internal stability of the duplex (low G/C content) are preferable for high activity because it can promotes strand selection and entry into the RISC. However, very low stability should be avoided since it may decrease the affinity of siRNA to its complementary mRNA and subse- quently affect its cleavage at the binding site [12]. In summary, all currently used selection criteria can be divided into ‘‘related’’ (group 1) or ‘‘unrelated’’ (group 2) parameters based on the stability of siRNA termini [18]. As per the rules for group 1, the ability of siRNA antisense strand to enter into RISC is critical for the mRNA cleavage. siRNA strands with less stable 50 end enters RISC faster than other strands that explains why the 50 end of the antisense strand needs to be A/U rich and 30 end G/C rich. The unrelated (group 2) rules include (i) presence of a specific nucleotide at a certain position; (ii) the stability of secondary structure of the target mRNA; (iii) the stability of the siRNA antisense strand; and (iv) the percentage of a particular nucleotide in the siRNA [18]. In addition to the properties of siRNA, structure and accessibility of the target site should also be considered as a criterion in designing potent siRNA. For the first time, Tafer et al. described a comprehensive analysis of the effect of target mRNA structure on RNAi and developed a new siRNA design tool, RNAxs, which combines known siRNA selection criteria with target mRNA accessibility. RNAxs was calibrated with two data sets of 573 siRNAs for 38 genes and then tested on an independent set of 360 siRNAs targeting additional four genes. Compared to previously reported criteria which only considered the siRNA duplex sequence, RNAxs significantly improved the prediction of effective siRNAs after incorporating the selection criteria for target site acces- sibility [19]. 2.3 siRNA Versus shRNA Generally, there are two strategies to introduce siRNA into mammalian cells: (i) chemical synthesis strategy in which the synthetic siRNA is directly intro- duced into target cells or (ii) DNA-based (plasmid or viral vector) strategy in which the siRNA is produced via intracellular processing of the expressed RNA hairpin transcript (Fig. 2). There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each strategy. RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 403 The most common strategy is to directly introduce chemically synthesized double-stranded siRNA of 21–23 nucleotides into mammalian cells. There are several advantages of using synthetic siRNA: (i) easy to synthesize and use; (ii) high transfection efficiency into the cells with potent and specific gene silencing effect; (iii) the amount and purity of siRNA can be controlled easily; (iv) quick initiation of gene silencing effect; and (v) various modifications can be introduced to enhance siRNA’s stability and targeting specificity [9]. However, the silencing effect of synthesized siRNA is transient because there is no siRNA replication in mammalian cells [20]. Consequently, repeated treatment of siRNA is needed and the subsequently high cost limits its application in animal and clinical studies [21]. Considering the limitations of synthetic siRNA, the DNA-based shRNA strategy has been developed as it provides a stable expression of siRNA in the treated cells and the cost is much lower. Typically, synthetic siRNA mediates silencing effects for 2–3 days post-transfection, while the shRNA expression vector produces siRNAs continuously in cells and silence the expression of target gene for weeks or even months [22]. Another advantage of shRNA is that the multiple siRNA expression cassettes can be constructed within one vector so that it can knockdown several different sites of a target gene or several different genes simultaneously. In the DNA-based expression vector, shRNA is expressed in cells under the control of an RNA polymerase II or polymerase III promoter. Polymerase II promoter can induce tissue-specific RNA expression but also induces the inter- feron response in many mammalian cells [9]. Thus, the application of polymer- ase II promoter is limited and polymerase III promoter is commonly used in shRNA applications. Polymerase III promoters have a relatively simple struc- ture, a well-defined transcription initiation and a termination signal consisting of five thymidines. More importantly, the transcript is cleaved after the second uridine of the termination site, which yields a transcript resembling the end of synthetic siRNA [22]. To date, there are two RNA polymerase III promoters, the human H1 promoter (H1) and the human U6 small nuclear promoter (U6), available to drive the shRNA expression. It is however notable that H1 and U6 promoters may give different silencing efficiency. Makinen et al. have demon- strated the difference between U6 and H1 promoters in a lentiviral vector- mediated RNAi using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a target gene. The U6 promoter was found to be more efficient than H1 in silencing GFP in vitro. It persistently silenced 80% of the GFP gene for several months. In addition, U6 promoter also showed higher in vivo silencing effect in mouse brain for at least 9 months [23]. This result is in agreement with another study using AAV as a vector to express shRNA under U6 or H1 promoter [24]. The U6 promoter- derived caspase 8 siRNA successfully silenced the caspase expression, while the H1 promoter-driven shRNA failed to show the silencing effect. Although the exact reason was not clear, it was conceivable that the U6 promoter’s high expression may contribute to this difference [24]. 404 K. Cheng and B. Qin To study the function of genes involved in cell growth or survival, a tightly regulated siRNA expression is required. Recently, several tetracycline-responsive variants of U6 and H1 promoters have been developed as inducible promoter systems to drive conditional shRNA expression [25, 26]. Generally, a tetracycline operator (tetO) sequence, which has a high-binding affinity for tetracycline repressor (tetR), is inserted near the TATA box of the promoter. Once the tetR binds to the tetO sequence, the tetR will prevent RNA polymerase III from binding to the promoter to initiate the transcription. Subsequently, adding analogs with higher affinity for tetR will cause the tetR to dissociate from tetO and the transcription is restored [25]. Therefore the inducible shRNA expression system is not only a useful tool for basic research on gene function but also a potential approach for therapeutic applications [25]. Although DNA-based shRNA expression vector has been widely used in gene function study as well as therapeutic application, most vectors only con- tain one single siRNA expression cassette [27]. To maximize the efficiency and versatility, shRNA expression vector containing multiple tandem expression cassettes have been developed. Up to six tandem cassettes can be successfully constructed into one single shRNA expression vector and produces different shRNA simultaneously [27]. Accordingly, these vectors can silence multiple genes or maximize the silencing effect by targeting different regions of the same gene [27, 28]. The multiple shRNA expression vector is best suited for cancer treatment where multiple pathways are needed to be targeted simultaneously. Chen et al. has constructed a multiple shRNA expression vector targeting the mRNA of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and antiapoptotic factor Bcl-XI. The multiple expression vector was injected intratumorally into the tumor formed by human laryngeal squamous carcinoma (Hep-2) cells implanted in nude mice. Significant reduction in VEGF, Htert, and Bcl-XI mRNAs and protein levels were observed and tumor growth of treated group was obviously smaller than that of the control group with blank vector. This result demonstrated the potential applica- tion of multiple gene silencing using shRNA vector in cancer therapy [29]. 2.4 Virus-Based shRNA Expression Vector The shRNA expression vector can be plasmid-based or viral-based. Although plasmid-based shRNA expression vectors have been successfully developed in many applications, they usually have low transfection efficiency, especially in primary cells and non-dividing cells [9]. To overcome problems associated with the plasmid vector, viral vectors including adenoviral, adeno-associated viral (AAV), retroviral and lentiviral vectors, have been developed. Although lenti- viral vector can express integrated siRNA efficiently in a wide variety of actively dividing, non-dividing and primary cells, its infrequent insertional mutagenesis limited its therapeutic application [30]. As a relatively safe and efficient vector RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 405 for a wide variety of cell types, adenoviral vector is a popular vector for therapeutic delivery of shRNA [31]. Jung et al. generated adenoviral vector encoding shRNA against pituitary tumor transforming 1 (PTTG1) and treated hepatoma cells. The PTTG1 expression was specifically silenced, leading to activation of p53 and induction of cell apoptosis. Intratumoral delivery of the adenoviral vector significantly inhibits the tumor growth in nude mice [31]. In addition, AAV is another promising vector for shRNA therapies because of its unique features: (i) lack of immune and inflammatory responses; (ii) ability to infect dividing and non-dividing cells over a broad host range; (iii) long-term shRNA expression after integration into host chromosome [24]. Tomar et al. created a series of modified AAV vectors expressing shRNAs targeting p53 or caspase 8 under the control of H1 or U6 promoter. An enhanced green fluor- escent protein (EGFP) was also cloned in the vector as a report gene to monitor the infection efficiency. Results demonstrated that the AAV-based vector was efficient in infecting and expressing shRNA in mammalian cells [24]. 2.5 Limitations of siRNA Therapeutic Application Initially, the application of RNAi was emerged as a powerful tool for gene knockdown experiments to understand gene functions. However, the impress- ive in vitro results of RNAi soon spurred researcher’s interest to develop RNAi therapeutics. In 2002, Mc Caffrey et al. reported the first proof-of-concept study of in vivo gene silencing by synthetic siRNA and shRNA [32]. siRNA and luciferase plasmid were co-injected into mice and luciferase expression was monitored using quantitative whole body imaging. Specific inhibition of luci- ferase expression by an average of 81% in mice was detected in 11 independent experiments [32]. Later, Song et al. reported the first in vivo therapeutic appli- cation of siRNA targeting the gene Fas (encoding the Fas receptor) to protect mice from liver failure and fibrosis [33]. The synthetic siRNA was injected into mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection and 88% of hepatocytes took up the siRNA after 24 h. Both mRNA and protein expressions of Fas gene were reduced and the effects persisted for 10 days. Furthermore, the siRNA treat- ment protected mice from fulminant hepatitis and hepatic fibrosis in two different animal models [33]. Notwithstanding these exciting studies for potential therapeutic application, several important considerations should be emphasized [5, 34]. Both studies administrated siRNA into mice using hydrodynamic injection in which a large volume (1 ml/20 g body weight) was rapidly injected into the tail vein within a short period of several seconds. Apparently, it is not applicable for human beings because about 3.5 liters of solution is needed to be injected into a 70 kg patient within a few minutes [5]. The major bottleneck in the development of siRNA therapeutics is the efficient delivery of siRNA to target cells. The difficulty is mainly due to the 406 K. Cheng and B. Qin pharmacokinetic profiles of siRNA. To reach the target site, systemically administered siRNAs need to overcome several biological barriers: moving from the bloodstream into tissues, passing through the extracellular space, crossing the cell membrane, and then entering the cytoplasm to silence the target mRNA. In the plasma, single-stranded RNA is degraded by nucleases within seconds, whereas double-stranded RNA molecules have a longer half- life of approximate 6 minutes in rats. However, it is still far below the stability requirements for systemic administration [35]. The cellular uptake of naked siRNA is also very limited because of its negative charge and large molecular weight. Subsequently, to bypass these problems associated with siRNA, local administration of siRNA becomes the favorable approach and most of the current siRNA clinical trials are based on the local delivery of naked siRNA (Table 2) [5]. Nevertheless, systemic delivery is the desired route for most siRNA therapies. Tremendous efforts have been made to overcome these challenges, cationic liposome and positively charged polymers are currently being used as the most common method to complex with negatively charged siRNA for systemic delivery [30, 36]. Other in vivo delivery approaches include conjugation with cholesterol, aptamer, peptide; complexation with antibody–protamine fusion protein; or encapsulation in cyclodextrin nanoparticles [35, 37–39]. To improve the in vivo stability of siRNA, various chemical modifications have been developed in relevant subunits, such as sugar, base, and phosphate moieties. One of the simplest modifications is the introduction of phosphor- othioate (PS) linkage, which can enhance the resistance of siRNA to nucleases and subsequently increase the in vivo half-life. However, extensive phosphor- othioate linkages are not desirable because it extensively bind to serum protein and can be toxic in vivo [40]. In addition, PS modification has shown reduced siRNA activity compared to unmodified siRNA [41]. Alternatively, modifica- tion of the 20-OH group in the ribose is another common method to increase the stability against nucleases while not affect the silencing effect. Typically, 20-O- methyl (2 0-OMe) and 20-O-fluoro (20-F) modifications are among the most prominent methods. On account of the unfavorable pharmacokinetic proper- ties, 20-F modified siRNAs are less potent than unmodified siRNAs in the animal [42]. In contrast, incorporation of 20-OMe modified nucleotides in siRNA is well tolerated and siRNA with every other 20-OMe modification is resistant to nuclease and enhanced activity has been observed [43]. Contrary to antisense oligonucleotides, chemical modifications for siRNA should be designed cautiously so that they do not affect the silencing effect of siRNA. Once inside the cells, siRNA duplex will be unwound and the antisense strand will be incorporated into the RISC, followed by binding to its homo- logous target mRNA for endonucleolytic cleavage. Taking these facts into consideration, any modification of the antisense strand (especially the 50 end) should be avoided and most of reported modifications are located in the sense strand [11, 44].

Cheng and B. Qin There are usually two potential side effects associated with siRNA, off-target effect and induction of interferon (IFN). siRNA was assumed to be highly specific for target mRNA and even a single base mismatch was believed to protect mRNA from degradation [45]. However, recent studies have shown that mRNA having less than 100% complementarity with the siRNA can also be silenced [46–50]. This phenomenon is called off-target effect and it may cause undesired effects as well as toxicity. Sometimes, siRNA can silence non-target genes containing only 11–15 contiguous nucleotides of identity to the siRNA [46]. Fedorov et al. evaluated 176 randomly selected siRNAs to determine the relationship between cell survival and off-target effects. Twenty-nine percent of the tested siRNAs induced sequence-independent changes in cell viability, indicating the off-target derived phenotypes are much more extensive than originally anticipated [49]. The 50 end of siRNA antisense strand was found as the primary determinant for regulation of the off-target effects [50]. Subse- quently, chemical modification, especially the 20-O-methyl substitution in the antisense strand, was found to be able to substantially eliminate the off-target effects [51]. In addition, computer algorithms have been developed to address the off-target problem [52]. Nevertheless, the off-target effects emphasize the need to spend more effort in the design and validation of siRNAs before conducting experiments. Soon after the discovery of RNAi, the application of RNAi to mammalian cells was not successful due to the fact that dsRNA >30bp in mammalian cells can trigger the nonspecific interferon responses, which limits its therapeutic application [53]. This immune response is believed to be caused by the activa- tion of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), 20,5 0-oligoadenylate synthetase or Toll-like receptors (TLR) [54]. In 2001, for the first time, Elbashir et al. succeeded in silencing a target gene in human cells without inducing IFN response using a 21-nt siRNA [55]. The sequence of siRNA maybe too short to be recognized by the dsRNA-dependent sensors. However, even unmodified siRNA sometimes induces innate immune responses which represent a signifi- cant barrier to the therapeutic application of siRNA [56]. Till now, chemical modifications have been the best strategy to abrogate the immunostimulatory activity of siRNA. By selective incorporation of small number (<20% of all nucleotides) of 20-O-methyl uridine or guanosine into one strand of the siRNA, the immune stimulation can be completely abrogated without disrupting its silencing activity [54, 57]. 3 Screening for Therapeutic Targets in Malignancy The great potential of RNAi in cancer therapy has been recognized since its discovery in 1998. The first step toward the treatment of cancer using RNAi is the understanding of the tumorigenic process and identifying genes which are responsible for tumor cell’s initiation and progression. Currently, majority of RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 409 new anti-cancer therapeutics under development are directed against existing targets, while only a few drugs are developed against novel targets. It is mainly because that identifying new targets for cancer therapy is a difficult, time- consuming, and expensive process. Consequently, many key genes or proteins related to cancer have not been selected as targets for drug development [58]. Traditionally, homologous recombination was the only method to determine the function of the interested genes, such as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. However, the production of knockout animal using recombinant tech- nology is very time consuming and complicated. Alternatively, potent and specific gene silencing ability make RNAi-based screening a novel tool to identify genes which are responsible for certain aspects in cancer biology [7]. siRNA/shRNA has been successfully performed to determine the function of a specific gene in cancer biology without generating knockout animals. Gener- ally, two methods can be used to uncover the biomarkers related with tumor- igenesis: (i) use siRNA directly to establish knockdown cell lines or (ii) use RNAi library to screen the important genes involved in tumorigenesis. 3.1 Gene KnockDown Cells Gene knockdown cells is an easy and fast way to study the function of interested gene in vitro using cell lines. Ganesan et al. used siRNA to knock down the expression of BRCA1 (breast cancer 1, early onset) in female somatic cells and observed the destabilization of the silenced state of inactivative X chromosome (Xi). These observations suggested that the loss of BRCA1 in female cells may lead to Xi perturbation as well as destabilization of its silenced state [59]. To explore the oncogenic potential of leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (LARS1) in lung cancer, Shin et al. knocked down LARS1 in lung cancer cells using siRNA and then examined the tumor behavior. Knockdown cells showed reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar and slow migration through transwell membrane. Consequently, LARS1 was identified as a potential biomarker for the migration and growth of lung cancer cells [60]. Compared to the transit knockdown effect of synthetic siRNA, retroviral vector-based shRNA provides a specific and stable inhibition of target gene in tumor cells. Brummelkamp et al. developed a retroviral vector to stably silence the expression of oncogenic K-RAS (V12) allele in human tumor cells. Knockdown of this gene resulted in a loss of the anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity, indicating the K-RAS gene as a potential therapeutic target for treating lung cancer [61]. Since this gene knockdown method can only screen one gene at one time, it is granted another name, ‘‘gene by gene’’ method. Obviously, this method is too tedious and expensive for multiple gene screening [62]. Alternatively, RNAi library provides a powerful tool to identify cancer-related genes in a large-scale pattern. Generally, the cells are transfected with RNAi library followed by biological screens. Cells reacting significantly are analyzed for the corresponding 410 K. Cheng and B. Qin siRNA, and subsequently the gene responsible for the reaction can be identified [7]. Two strategies, transfected cell array and RNAi barcode screens, have been developed for screening of cancer-related genes in mammalian cells. 3.2 Transfected Cell Array Transfected cell array (TCA) is a one-by-one arrayed approach using reverse transfection to interrogate phenotypes in a well-based format (Fig. 3). Two types of RNAi libraries, siRNA and plasmid-based shRNA libraries, can be used for this screening. While siRNA provides a fast and transit gene silencing effect, plasmid-based shRNA library provides a stable silencing effect from several days to several weeks so that it is possible to examine phenotypes that develop over a longer time span [63]. For screening, siRNA or shRNA targeting different genes are dissolved in gelatin solution and then plated at high density on a solid support array using a robotic arrayer or dispensing printer. Subsequently, the array is placed in tissue culture dish and covered with sufficient number of cells to achieve confluence at the end of the assay. Up to 6000 distinct siRNA or shRNA can be spotted in the same array and each spot can be covered by 30–500 cells. As cells reach the attached siRNA/shRNA, the siRNA/shRNA will be incorporated and a potential knockdown phenotype becomes detectable. The incorporation efficiency can be monitored by fluorescein-conjugated siRNA or shRNA encoding a reporter gene, green fluorescence protein (GFP) [5, 7, 62]. Fig. 3 Transfected cell array (TCA). siRNA/shRNA is arrayed on a solid support and mixed with cationic lipid to enhance the transfection efficiency. Then the cells are plated and grown on the solid support. As these cells uptake the siRNA/shRNA, phenotypes corresponding to specific silencing become detectable and the corresponding gene will be identified RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 411 High resolution imaging system with image analysis software is necessary to analyze the array. Gene silencing effect can be detected by fluorescein-labeled antibodies for a specific protein. Induction of apoptosis can be detected by reagents like Annexin V and the cell morphology can be observed directly under microscope [7]. This technique provides broad applications for high-throughput, low-cost, and large-scale loss-of-function studies in mammalian cells [62]. There are three advantages of TCA: (i) each well is only transfected with one siRNA/shRNA and thus the screening sensitivity is high; (ii) it provides high- throughput screening of cells within their micro-environment, which is impor- tant for gene function study; and (iii) fewer cells per gene are required than standard microwell plate-based methods, which is particularly important for primary cells since the number of isolated cells are often very limited [5, 64]. However, the major challenge of this approach is to produce and array large number of siRNA/shRNA, as well as the requirement of upfront investment in the infrastructure such as the liquid handling robots [64]. 3.3 RNAi Barcode Screens Another commonly used RNAi screening method uses pooled shRNA library and it is also known as RNAi barcode screens. shRNA libraries are mainly used in this pooled base assays and it is a promising approach to identify novel targets for cancer therapy. The screening protocol is illustrated in Fig. 4. shRNA library is constructed and then packaged into retroviruses, which are used to infect target cells. Appropriate amounts of viruses are added to cells so that each cell, on average, contains a single integrated virus and each individual shRNA infects \u00031000 cells. The shRNA expression cassette consists of two unique components, the shRNA sequence and a unique DNA sequence which is called barcode [62]. The barcode is designed to rapidly identify individual shRNA vector associated with a specific phenotype [65]. After infection, cells or clones which display a specific phenotype, such as resistance to a small molecular inhibitor, are isolated and shRNA sequences are identified using PCR and sequencing [58, 64]. By com- paring barcode from cells treated in different conditions, researchers can assess the effects of a given individual shRNA on the cell’s response to a specific treatment, subsequently the function of the related gene will be determined [63]. For example, to search for components of the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway Berns et al. constructed a large set of retroviral vectors encoding 23742 distinct shRNAs targeting 7914 different human genes. One known and five new modulators of the p53-dependent proliferation arrest were identified using colony formation assays. Inhibition of each of these five genes resulted in resistance to three different p53-depedent proliferation arrests, indicating them as the possible tumor suppressor genes [65]. All these studies highlighted the power of large-scale RNAi screen in identifying cancer-related genes in 412 K. Cheng and B. Qin mammalian cells. However, the major limitation of this screening method is the difficulty in isolation of small number of cells exhibiting specific phenotype from a large cell population. Therefore, growth selection is commonly used to induce colony formation [64]. Bearing in mind the fact that the high-quality RNAi libraries have only become available recently and most groups are in the process of carrying out their explora- tory studies, the large-scale RNAi library screen is still in its early stage [66]. Fig. 4 siRNA barcode screen. First, plasmids encoding shRNA and barcode sequences are packaged into retroviruses which are used to infect cells at a concentration of 1 virus per cell. Cells are divided and treated with different culture conditions. DNA is then extracted from selected cells and the barcode is recovered by PCR. The abundance of each barcode can be determined by hybridization to a DNA microarray containing the complement of these sequences. Finally, the shRNA in each cell group will be identified RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 413 4 siRNA Gene Targets Involved in Carcinogenesis Cancer is fundamentally the unlimited and continuous growth of cells caused by the loss of normal cell behavior including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [67]. It is essentially a genetic disease affected by three types of gene alterations: oncogene activation, tumor-suppressor gene suppression, and sta- bility gene dysfunction [2]. Unlike other genetic diseases, wherein only one mutated gene can cause disease, cancer is usually caused by multiple gene alternations. Vogelstein et al. have summarized various cancer genes and related pathways in a comprehensive review [2]. Table 3 listed the genes which have been investigated for RNAi therapy of several common cancers including breast, prostate, and lung cancer. 4.1 Genes Involved in Tumorgenesis Oncogene normally encodes positive signals for cell growth and division, whereas tumor-suppressor gene prevents cells to develop to cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation. Stability genes are responsible for keeping genetic alterations, which happens in normal cells, to a minimum level by different repairing mechanisms. Thus, when they are inactivated, mutations in normal genes will occur at a high rate resulting in high chance of tumorigenesis [2]. For the treatment of cancer, the oncogene level should be reduced while the tumor- suppressor gene and stability gene levels should be restored. Subsequently, oncogenes are the primary targets of RNAi-based cancer therapy. On the con- trary, the application of RNAi in tumor-suppressor gene and stability gene is mainly focused on the identification or elucidation of the correlated mechanisms. 4.2 Genes Involved in Tumor–Host Interactions Another important targets of RNAi therapy are genes involved in the tumor– host interactions. As neoplastic cells grow and spread within the host environ- ment, there are several steps required, such as the new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) to obtain sufficient oxygen and nutrients, breaking down of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize, and the improved motility of tumor cells and immune evasion [3, 68]. Particularly, the role of angiogenesis in tumor growth has been well recognized since Folk- man hypothesized that the inhibition of angiogenesis could be an effective approach for treating cancer [69]. Tumor angiogenesis is controlled by the balance of numerous activators and inhibitors. Activators include VEGF, the transcription factor for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1a), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Among them, VEGF has been proved the key contribu- tor to tumor angiogenesis and growth [70]. Although blocking VEGF or VEGF 414 K. Cheng and B.

Several studies have demonstrated efficient delivery of siRNA in vivo as well as its therapeutic effect in animal model. Recently in 2008, FDA approved the first clinical study using targeted cyclodextrin-containing nanoparticle for the systemic delivery of an anti-cancer siRNA, RONDELTM, developed by Calando Pharmaceutical Inc. Although there are several reports of local delivery of naked siRNA into eye, lung, or other tissues without employing any carriers [71], it is not the preferred administration route for most RNAi cancer therapies. The large molecular weight and negative charges are two major obstacles which hinder the systemic delivery of naked siRNA. A series of carriers, including cationic lipids, peptides, synthetic or biodegradable polymers have been developed to enhance the cross- membrane capability of siRNA. Although plasmid DNA (pDNA) and siRNA have similar composition and identical negative charges/nucleotide ratio, they condense into different structures with cationic lipid/polymer, due to their dif- ference in the molecular weight and molecular topography. siRNA alone cannot be efficiently condensed into particles of nanometric dimensions while all pDNA can be condensed into nanoparticles of 60–100 nm when it is complexed with catiomic lipid [72]. Unlike pDNA, the electrostatic interaction between siRNA and cationic lipid is relatively uncontrolled and the encapsulation of siRNA is therefore incomplete [72]. Since plasmid-based shRNA shares the same proper- ties with pDNA in classic gene therapy, the same delivery strategies developed before for pDNA can also be used for shRNA. In this chapter we will focus on the nonviral delivery systems for synthetic siRNA, which has a very different struc- ture and properties from the previously investigated pDNA. 5.1 Components of the Delivery System for siRNA Generally, an efficient siRNA delivery system should contain the following components: a cationic group, an endosomal disrupting group, and a tumor- specific ligand. To neutralize the negatively charged siRNA, cationic lipid or polymer is commonly used in all siRNA delivery systems [73]. The complexa- tion can induce endocytosis by charge-mediated interaction with negative charges on the cell membrane surface. After entering the cytoplasm, the anti- cancer efficacy of siRNA will not display unless it is released from the endosome 418 K. Cheng and B. Qin and silence the target mRNA. For this reason, fusogenic agents that can disrupt the endosome are generally required for the delivery system. Nonspe- cific delivery of therapeutics to normal cells and subsequent side effects is the major hurdle for all cancer therapies. Many unique receptors or antigens overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells provide good targets to design tumor-targeted delivery systems. Coupling tumor-specific ligands to the car- rier surface can trigger specific cells internalization of siRNA via ligand– receptor binding interaction. Figure 5 is the schematic diagram for a typical siRNA delivery system. In this system, siRNA are entrapped inside or condensed with the cationic materials (lipids, polymer, or peptides). Tumor-specific ligands (antibody, antibody fragments, peptides) are conjugated directly on the surface of the system or linked through flexible hydrophilic polymers, like PEG. For some polymer carriers, such as PEI and PAMAM dendrimers, endosomal release can be achieved without addition of the endosome disrupting agent due to their own special ‘‘proton-sponge’’ mechanism endorsed by their instinct secondary and tertiary amine structures [74]. However, for other polymers, such as PLL, the endosomal release agent is necessary in order to deliver siRNA efficiently into cytoplasm. Fig. 5 Schematic diagram of the siRNA delivery system. A cationic group is universal in all siRNA delivery systems to condense siRNA into nanosized complex. To release the siRNA from the endosome after endocytosis, an endosomal disrupting agent is also essential. PEG modification is also important to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the complex, as well as to avoid the nonspecific uptake by RES. To achieve the targeted delivery to tumor cells, various ligands including antibody, antibody fragments, peptides, small molecules should be modified to the complex directly or via PEG as a linker RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 419 5.2 Cationic Lipids and Polymers 5.2.1 Cationic Lipid Since the first introduction in 1987 for pDNA transfection, numerous cationic lipids have been developed for in vitro and in vivo delivery of nucleic acids, including siRNA recently [75]. Cationic lipid is currently the most common carrier to deliver siRNA into mammalian cells because it is technically simple, easy to formulate, and can be conjugated for specific applications [76]. Many commercial cationic liposomes (such as lipofectamine, oligofectamine, and RNAifect) are available for the in vitro transfection of siRNA. Generally, the cationic liposome is formulated by the mixture of cationic lipid, neutral helper lipid, and cholesterol at different ratios. Cationic lipid is a positively charged amphiphile system composed of a cationic head group and a lipid hydrophobic moiety. The cationic headgroup is a very important factor for the transfection efficiency. Me´ vel M. et al. have synthesized a series of cationic lipids containing different headgroups including arginine methyl ester, lysine methyl ester, homo- arginine methyl ester, ethylenediamine, guanidinium, diaminopropane, and imidazolium. The transfection efficiency of these lipids, alone or with the colipid DOPE (L-alpha-Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine), were evaluated in HEK293-T7 cells. The cationic lipid with imidazolium headgroup/DOPE lipoplex was proved to be the most efficient transfection reagent with low toxicity [77]. Based on the differences of their structure characteristics, cationic lipids can be classified into three groups: (i) monovalent aliphatic lipids which have a single amine function in the head group, e.g., N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N- trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) and N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]- N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP); (ii) multivalent aliphatic lipids containing more than one amine function in the head group, e.g., dioctadecyla- midoglycylspermine (DOGS); and (iii) cationic cholesterol derivatives, e.g., 3beta-[N-(N 0,N 0-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] cholesterol (DC-Chol) [76]. 5.2.2 Poly(ethyleneimine) Poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) is a series of synthetic polymers in branched or linear form with different molecular weights, ranging from 1 kDa to more than 1000 kDa [78]. It is well known as an efficient cationic polymer to introduce nucleic acids into mammalian cells. Its high cationic charge density can con- dense and compact pDNA into nanosized complex. In addition, the buffering capacity of PEI allows the nucleic acid to escape from the endosome through the ‘‘proton-sponge’’ effect [79]. The transfection efficiency of PEI is affected by the properties including molecular weight, degree of branching, branched or linear, and functionalized group modification. Generally, low molecular weight with branched architecture shows higher transfection efficiency and less cyto- toxicity [78]. A novel low-molecular weight PEI, F25-LMW PEI, was obtained 420 K. Cheng and B. Qin by fractionation of a commercially available 25-kDa PEI using size exclusion chromatography. Compared to the 25-kDa PEI, F25-LMW PEI showed higher transfection efficiency of siRNA with low toxicity in various cell lines and in the presence of serum, suggesting its potential in in vivo application [80, 81]. In addition, numerous modifications have been carried out in PEI to enhance the transfection efficiency and decrease the cytotoxicity. PEI was modified with different degrees of PEG substitution and the in vitro transfec- tion efficiency was evaluated for siRNA and pDNA. The transfection efficiency of siRNA/PEG-PEI complex was much less dependent on the PEGylation of PEI or on the N/P (PEI nitrogen/nucleic acid phosphate) ratio, which was critical for pDNA delivery [82]. PEGylation of PEI can improve the stability of siRNA complex against RNase digestion and heparin displacement. Both chain length and graft density of PEG strongly affect the stability and silencing efficiency of siRNA [83]. PEI was also modified by ketalization of the branches and ketalized PEI efficiently compacted siRNA into polyplexes with 80–200 nm in diameter. In vitro study demonstrated that the ketalization not only enhanced the transfection efficiency of siRNA but also reduced the cytotoxicity [84]. In order to achieve targeted delivery of siRNA to tumor cells, tumor- specific ligands, such as RGD and folate, have been conjugated to PEI using PEG as a linker [85, 86]. 5.2.3 Chitosan Chitosan is a natural, biodegradable linear amino polysaccharide composed of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and d-glucosamine subunits. Due to its low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and excellent biocompatibility, chitosan has been widely utilized as a delivery carrier for protein, peptide, pDNA, and siRNA. The physico-chemical properties of chitosan/DNA complex depend on the type, molecular weight, and deacetylation degree of the chitosan [76]. It can compact DNA into small particles (200\u0002500 nm) due to its cationic polyelectrolyte nature. To explore the application of chitosan in siRNA delivery, Katas et al. prepared chitosan/siRNA complex using two ionic cross-linking methods: simple complexation and ionic gelation using sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) [87]. Both methods formed nanosized particles less than 500 nm and the silencing effect was evaluated in CHO K1 and HEK293 cells. The association of siRNA with chitosan is a key factor for its silencing effect. Due to the high-binding capacity and loading efficiency, entrapping siRNA in the chitosan–TPP com- plex using ionic gelation method showed better effect than the simple chitosan/ siRNA complexation [87]. Besides the preparation method, molecular weight and deacetylation degree of chitosan also affect the silencing effect of siRNA [88]. Low-molecular weight (\u000310 kDa) chitosan showed little knockdown effect of target gene, while the highest silencing effect was achieved by the chitosan with high molecular weight (114 and 170 kDa) and high degree of deacetylation (84%), which formed a stable complex of \u0003200 nm [88]. RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 421 de Martimprey et al. have developed a novel chitosan coated nanoparticle for the delivery of siRNA against Ret/PTC1 junction oncogene. The coated chit- osan provides a strong electrostatic interaction with siRNA, while the core is composed of a biodegradable polymer, poly(isobutylcyanoacrylate). Complex formation with the nanoparticles protected the Ret/PTC1 siRNA from in vivo degradation and the siRNA complex significantly inhibited the tumor growth after intratumoral administration [89]. Another novel chitosan-based siRNA nanoparticle was developed by Howard et al. [90]. Nanoparticles sized from 40 to 600 nm were rapidly uptaken into NIH 3T3 cells within 1 h, followed by accumulation over 24 h. The siRNA nanoparticles knocked down endogenous enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene expression in H1299 human lung carcinoma cells and murine peritoneal macrophages. In addition, effective in vivo silencing was demonstrated in bronchiole epithelial cells of transgenic mice after nasal administration of the siRNA/chitosan nanoparticles [90]. 5.2.4 Dendrimer Dendrimer is a highly branched polymer with three-dimensional structures synthesized using divergent or convergent method. The architecture of dendri- mer generally consists of three regions: the core; the interior branches composed of tertiary amine groups which play a critical role in the endosomal releasing of dendrimer; and the periphery which includes many terminal function groups [91]. It has been extensively studied for the delivery of nucleic acid because the molecular weight, molecular size, and shape can be precisely controlled [78]. The primary amine groups of dendrimer condense and compact DNA into nanosized particles, while the internal tertiary amino groups act as proton- sponge in the endosome. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) is the most commonly used and commercially available dendrimer and its potential application as an siRNA carrier has been explored. The PAMAM/siRNA complex is affected by the siRNA molecular weight, dendrimer generation, and charge ratio between PAMAM and siRNA. High generation, large charge ratio, and large siRNA tend to form stable, uniform complex in nanosize. The effect of PAMAM on siRNA delivery is somewhat contradictory since unmodified PAMAM did not show any promis- ing effect in siRNA delivery, but modified PAMAM did enhance siRNA delivery [92, 93]. Juliano et al. conjugated the Tat peptide, a cell-penetrating peptide, to PAMAM G5 dendrimer and formed complexes with antisense oligonucleotide and siRNA separately. The bioactivity was evaluated in NIH 3T3 MDR cells. The PAMAM complex only showed moderate effect for the delivery of antisense oligonucleotide, but not the siRNA [94]. In another approach, PAMAM dendrimer(G3) was conjugated with a-cyclodextrin and then utilized as an siRNA carrier. The complexes can significantly silence the target mRNA in NIH3T3 cells in the presence of serum. Intercellular distribu- tion studies showed that the carrier allowed siRNA to distribute in the cyto- plasm [92]. Furthermore, an internally quaternized and surface-acetylated 422 K. Cheng and B. Qin PAMAM (QPAMAM-NHAc) was developed for the delivery of siRNA. Surface modification of the amino groups to amide significantly decrease PAMAM’s toxicity. Enhanced cellular uptake and homogeneous cytoplasm distribution of siRNA after complexation with QPAMAM-NHAc was observed by confocal microscopy [93]. 5.3 Cell-Penetrating Peptide Cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is a short sequence of amino acids (less than 20 amino acid) that are capable of carrying active molecule to cross the plasma membrane and enter the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Based on its composi- tion, the CPP is divided into two categories: the amphiphathic helical peptides, such as transportan and model amphipathic peptide (MAP); and the arginine rich peptides, such as Tat (48-60) [95]. CPP has been widely used to deliver numerous biological or non-biological cargos including protein, nucleic acid, antibody, imaging agent, and liposomes into cells [95]. Recently, CPPs have been utilized to improve the delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo. Two different CPPs, penetratin and transportan, have been conjugated to the 50 end of siRNA via disulfide bond. The CPP–siRNA conjugates efficiently reduced the expression of reporter gene in cells [96]. In another study, siRNA targeting p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) was conjugated to two CPPs, Tat (48-60) and penetratin, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, both the Tat (48-46) and penetratin–siRNA Fig. 6 Conjugation of cell-penetrating peptides facilitates siRNA-mediated p38 MAP kinase silencing without transfection reagents. L929 cells were incubated for 24 h with siRNA in the absence of Lipofectamine-2000. p38 MAP kinase mRNA levels were determined using RT- PCR and normalized to 18s (**P<0.01; *P<0.05). (Adopted from Bioconjugate Chemistry 2007; 18:1450–1459) RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 423 conjugates knocked down about 40% of the p38MAPK gene expression at high concentration of 10 mM in in vitro transfection, whereas unconjugated siRNA did not show silencing effect at the concentration of 0.3–10 mM. However, the silencing effect of the CPP conjugated siRNA was not observed in mice by i.t. instillation [38]. In addition to Tat (48-60) and penetratin, another short amphipathic peptide, MPG, was applied to deliver siRNA into cultured cells [97]. Contrary to Tat (48-60) and penetratin, MPG was utilized to form stable complexes with siRNA rather than covalently conjugated to siRNA. MPG peptide can form nanoparticles with siRNA rapidly through electrostatic interactions and peptide–peptide interaction [97]. It has been successfully applied in an in vivo delivery of Oct-3/4 siRNA into mouse blastocytes. It forms stable nanoparti- cles with siRNA and protects siRNA from degradation [98]. 5.4 Cyclodextrin Cyclodextrin has been extensively used to increase the solubility of hydro- phobic drug in pharmaceutical industry for many years. In the mid-1990s, some groups began to design cyclodextrin-containing cationic polymer for gene delivery due to its low toxicity and little immune responses. Numerous cationic cyclodextrin polymers have been synthesized through grafting cyclo- dextrin to other cationic polymers including chitosan, PEI, and dendrimer [99]. Recently, cyclodextrin polycation systems were also utilized for siRNA delivery. In 2008, a targeted nanoparticle consisting of PEG and cationic cyclodextrin was approved by FDA for a phase I clinical trial of a systemic siRNA therapy. Davis et al. have developed a cyclodextrin-containing cationic carrier to condense siRNA to colloidal particles of 50 nm in diameter (Fig. 7). The carrier protects siRNA from degradation and the surface modified PEG stabilizes the siRNA complex in biological fluids. In addition, some PEG molecules were linked to a tumor-specific ligand, transferrin, to achieve the in vivo tumor-targeted delivery. Systemic administration of EWS-FL11 siRNA using the novel carrier significantly inhibited tumor growth in a murine model of metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma [100]. Furthermore, they eval- uated safety of the same system in cynomolgus monkeys after multiple, systemic administration of siRNA. The system is well tolerated at doses of 3 and 9 mg siRNA/kg and no system-specific antibody response was detected after multiple injections. Only mild immune response was observed at a very high dose, 27 mg siRNA/kg [101]. These results provided strong evidence for the safety and efficacy of the cyclodextrin-containing carrier for siRNA delivery. 424 K. Cheng and B. Qin 5.5 Atelocollagen Atelocollagen is a highly purified, pepsin treated type I collagen with low immu- nogenicity and positive charge. It has been widely used in wound-healing, vessel prosthesis, and as bone cartilage substitute and hemostatic agent [102]. Atelo- collagen can form complex with siRNA as nanosized particles with a diameter of 100\u0002300 nm. The complex provides nuclease resistance, efficient cellular uptake, prolonged release, and increased in vivo half-life for siRNA [103]. Since atelo- collagen is a liquid at 48C and becomes gel at 378C, it can be used as a site-specific Fig. 7 Schematic diagram of the cyclodextrin-containing delivery system. (a) Components of the delivery system. The CDP condenses siRNA and protects it from degradation. The AD- PEG stabilizes the complexes in systemic circulation via inclusion compound formation.

CDP, AD-PEG, and Tf-PEG-AD are com- bined and added to siRNA to generate stable complex. (Adopted from Cancer Research 2005; 65: 8984–8992) RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 425 in vivo delivery system for nucleic acid including siRNA [104]. In an in vivo study with site-specific administration, VEGF siRNA with atelocollagen efficiently suppressed tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in a prostate cancer xenograft model [104]. Similar silencing effect was also observed in an orthotopic xenograft model of human testicular cancer using site-specific in vivo administration of siRNA/atelocollagen complex [103]. Moreover, atelocollagen can be used for systemic siRNA delivery. After i.v. injection, siRNA/atelocollagen complex was delivered to tumors within 24 h and stayed intact for 3 days. Accordingly, the delivered siRNA showed significant reduction of target gene expression in bone- metastatic prostate tumor cells [105]. 6 Ligand-Targeted Delivery of siRNA to Tumor Cells To develop an efficient siRNA cancer therapy, targeted delivery of siRNA to tumor cells is the primary requisite to overcome nonspecific side effects, as well as increase the therapeutic effect. Most cancer cells express unique or over- expressed receptors/antigens on their cell surface which can bind various ligands including antibodies, antibody fragments, small molecules, peptides, and aptamers. A number of tumor-specific ligands have been modified to the siRNA delivery system to enhance the specific cellular uptake in tumor cells. The most commonly used ligands are described below. 6.1 Antibodies Antibody is a fundamental substance in immune response and it is composed of a pair of heavy chains and a pair of light chains. The variable regions of antibody can recognize and bind to specific epitope of antigen in a high affinity [106]. In the past decades, monoclonal antibody-mediated targeted delivery has spurred great attention in cancer therapy and the intact monoclonal antibody has been used for the targeted delivery of various therapeutics including nucleic acids [107]. However, the large size of intact antibody molecule (Mw 159 kDa) limits its application to some extent. Alternatively, antibody fragments were successfully exploited as ligands for targeted drug delivery to tumor cells because they have a small molecular weight and remain the same binding specificity as the parent antibody with low immunogenicity [106, 108]. The most frequently used antibody fragments are F(ab0)2, Fab0 and single-chain Fv fragment (scFv), all of which lack the Fc domain and the complement- activating region. Both Fab0 and scFv have only one binding region, while F(ab0)2, which consisted of two Fab0 linked by a disulphide bond, is bivalent and thus have higher binding affinity than Fab0 and scFv [108]. Compared to intact antibody, antibody fragments have several advantages: (i) antibody fragments avoid the possibility of binding with non-target cells caused by the 426 K. Cheng and B. Qin interaction of Fc domain with Fc receptor in normal cells; (ii) the size of antibody fragments are much smaller than that of entire antibody, thus the tissue penetration will be improved; (iii) the cost and manufacture time of antibody fragments are lower than that of the whole antibody because antibody fragments can be easily produced in bacteria in a large scale [106]. In 2005, Song et al. evaluated the first in vivo study of an antibody-mediated siRNA delivery system [39]. A Fab antibody fragment (F105) against HIV-1 envelope was fused to protamine and the fusion protein (F-105P) was able to deliver siRNA only into cells expressing HIV-1 envelope. Systemic administra- tion of F-105P/siRNA complex into mice delivered siRNA into HIV-1 expressing tumors, but not the HIV-1 negative tumors and other normal cells. Administra- tion of F105-P with siRNAs targeting oncogenes including c-my, MDM2, and VEGF inhibited the growth of HIV-1 expressing tumor cells. Furthermore, the authors fused Her-2 scFv with protamine and it could deliver siRNA specifically to the Her-2 expressing tumor cells in a breast cancer xenograft model in vivo [39]. Instead of designing antibody fusion protein, immunoliposome prepared with antibody-conjugated cationic lipid is another approach for siRNA delivery. After complexing with immunoliposome, siRNA can be specifically delivered into tumor cells [109, 110]. Antibody or antibody fragment can be conjugated to the surface of cationic liposome or to the terminus of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is grafted on the surface of liposome. For example, scFV can be covalently coupled to liposome via a reaction between cysteine at the 3’-end of the protein and a maleimide group on the liposome. The modification does not affect the immunological activity and targeting ability of the scFv [111]. Pirollo et al. developed a nanoimmunoliposome modified with anti-TfR scFV to deliver siRNA to tumor cells. A fluorescein-labeled siRNA was deliv- ered via systemic injection and it was specifically distributed into primary and metastatic tumor cells [110]. Later, the authors developed a similar nanoimmu- noliposome for an anti-Her-2 siRNA. To enhance the endosomal release, a pH- sensitive histidine–lysine peptide was included in the complex. The in vitro results showed that the complexes can sensitize human cancer cells to che- motherapeutics. Furthermore, systemic delivery of the siRNA significantly inhibit tumor growth in a pancreatic cancer model [109]. 6.2 Transferrin Transferrin is a very common ligand used to target tumor cells. It is an 80 kDa monomeric glycoprotein which can form complex with ferric ion and facilitate the cellular uptake of iron through binding with transferrin receptor (TfR). Through a circle of endocytosis and exocytosis of transferrin meditated by TfR, the iron was delivered into the cells [112]. TfR is a transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of two subunits linked by a disulfide bond and each of the monomer binds one transferrin molecule. The X-ray crystal structure studies revealed that RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 427 the TfR is composed of three parts: an NH2-terminal cytoplasmic region con- taining internalization motif Tyr-Thr-Arg-Phe, a transmembrane region, and a large extracellular domain which contains binding site for transferrin [113]. TfR is widely expressed in human body, including red blood cells, thyroid cells, hepatocytes, intestinal cells, brain, and the blood–brain barrier. However, there are overexpression of TfR on the surface of tumor cells since high level of iron is essential for the tumor growth [113]. Therefore, transferrin is widely used as a targeting ligand in the targeted delivery of antitumor agents including nucleic acids and proteins to tumor cells with high TfR expression. Generally, the transferrin is directly conjugated to anti-cancer drug or to the surface of delivery vehicles, such as liposome, nanoparticle, and complex [100, 113– 115]. In an in vitro study, cationic liposomes associated with transferrin were complexed with siRNA at different lipid/siRNA ratios. Transferrin modified liposome efficiently delivered siRNA into cells via endocytosis [115]. Bartllet et al. designed a transferrin modified nanoparticle to deliver siRNA targeting ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) to tumors. After intra- venous administration of the transferrin modified nanoparticles at a dose of 2.5 mg siRNA/kg for three consecutive days, significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in the A/J mice bearing Neuro2A tumors, whereas the unmodified nanoparticles formulation showed much less effect [116]. Further- more, they employed positron emission tomography (PET)/computer tomo- graphy (CT) to study the whole-body biodistribution profiles and localization of siRNA in the tumor site. Simultaneously, they measure the gene knockdown effect of siRNA using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) in the mice bearing luciferase-expressing Neuro2A tumors. Transferrin modified nanoparticles reduced tumor luciferase activity by 50% compared to unmodified nanoparti- cles. However, both nanoparticles showed similar pharmacokinetic profiles and tumor localization. Compartmental modeling suggested that the major advan- tage of the targeted nanoparticles was the increased cellular uptake in tumor cells rather than the overall localization at tumor site [114]. A similar TfR-meditated delivery system was applied to deliver siRNA- targeting EWS-FLI1 gene in a murine model of metastatic Ewing’s sarcoma. Systemic treatments of TfR-targeted siRNA formulation significantly inhibited the engraftment of TC71-LUC cells, while elimination of the anti-cancer effects was observed when removing transferrin from the delivery system [100]. 6.3 Folic Acid Folate receptor has been intensively studied as a target for tumor-specific drug delivery because it has a limited distribution in normal tissues, but a significant overexpression on a series of malignant tumors including carci- noma of ovary, breast, kidney, brain, endometrium, colon, and hematopoie- tic cells of myelogenous origin [117]. Folate receptor is represented by a family 428 K. Cheng and B. Qin of glycopolypeptides including four isoforms: FR-a, b, g,and d.Both FR-a and FR-b are membrane-associated proteins which are attached to the plasma mem- brane by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor [118]. Folic acid, a neces- sary vitamin for the body, has a high affinity for folate receptor (Kd ¼ 10 \u000210 M), even after bioconjugation with therapeutic drugs. For this reason, folic acid has been exploited as a ligand for tumor targeting via conjugation to numerous chemotherapeutic agents, liposomes, and imaging agents [119]. Zhang et al. conjugated folic acid to the 50-end of a 17 nt oligodeoxynucleo- tide (ODN). Subsequently, siRNAs targeting aV integrin gene were tethered to the folic acid–ODN conjugate through base pair interaction between a 15 nt ‘‘hook-like structure’’ of the ODN and a ‘‘complimentary hook’’ sequence at the 30-end extension of the siNRA’s sense strand. After treating with folate–ODN/ siRNA complex, about 80% inhibition of the aV integrin mRNA was observed in HUVEC cells. It is concluded that the delivery process was folate receptor mediated since the siRNA/ODN complex without folate conjugation failed to show any silencing effect [117]. 6.4 Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid (RGD) Peptide RGD peptide is a popular tool for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to avb3 integrin, which is a type of cell surface receptor distributing in tumor neovasculature, melanoma, and glioblastoma. Each year, a number of RGD peptides have been developed based on the module of ‘‘arginine-glycine-aspartic acid’’ sequence. It was found that all the RGD–peptide ligands are cyclic and have at least one ring structure [120]. RGD peptides were widely exploited in the targeted drug delivery, imaging agent and nucleic acids via conjugating multiple RGD peptides with carrier systems like liposomes or nanoparticles. Self- assembling nanoparticles constructed by RGD–PEG–PEI has been prepared to deliver siRNA targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF R2) to angiogenic vasculature in neuroblastoma N2A tumor-bearing mice [121]. After systemic administration, the siRNA nanoparticles was selectively uptaken by tumor cells and inhibited tumor angiogenesis and growth [121]. 6.5 Aptamer Aptamer is a globular-shaped oligonucleotide that is identified by the systema- tic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process. It has the similar composition as natural nucleic acid, but the nucleotides of aptamer have 20-modified sugars to enhance the nuclease resistance [122]. Since its discovery in 1990, aptamer has become a valuable research tool. Aptamers can specifically bind to target protein with high affinity, therefore it can be utilized in the targeted delivery of siRNA [37, 123]. For example, prostate-specific membrane RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 429 antigen (PSMA) is a type II protein synthesized by prostatic epithelium and it is overexpressed in the most advanced androgen-resistant prostate cancer cells. PSMA is believed to be an ideal target for the targeted drug delivery systems to prostate cancer [124]. McNamara et al. have developed a PSMA aptamer–- siRNA chimeras to deliver functional siRNA into prostate cancer cells. The aptamer portion of the chimeras guided siRNA to prostate tumor cells and then the siRNA silenced the target gene. Significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in a mouse xenograft model bearing PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, after treatment with the aptamer–siRNA chimeras (Fig. 8b). Fig. 8 Antitumor activity of aptamer–siRNA chimera in a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer. (a) Chimeric siRNA and PBS were administered intratumorally in mice bearing either PSMA-negative prostate cancer cells, PC-3 (left panel) or PSMA-positive cells, LNCaP (right panel). Tumors were measured every 3 days and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA (***P<0.0001; **P<0.001; *P<0.01, n=6–8). (b) Histology of LNCaP tumors treated with chimeric RNAs. Formalin-fixed tumors were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematox- ylin and eosin. (Adopted from Nature Biotechnology 2006; 24: 1005–1015) 430 K. Cheng and B. Qin However, the antitumor effect was not observed in mouse xenograft model bearing PSMA-negative prostate cancer cells (Fig. 8a), PC-3, indicating that the antitumor effect of the siRNA chimeras was mediated by the recognition of aptamer to PSMA [123]. In a similar study, PSMA aptamer was conjugated to siRNA via a streptavidin linker. The aptamer–siRNA conjugates can be upta- ken by cells and mediate specific silencing effect without the help of cationic lipids [37]. 7 Perspectives As one of the most exciting discoveries in the last decade, RNAi has exhibited the greatest potential for treating cancer, one of the most devastating diseases. siRNA can be used for large-scale screening to identify cancer-related genes, or it can be used directly as a therapeutics to silence specific genes which are involved in the tumor growth and differentiation. Since its discovery in 1998, RNAi technology has moved remarkably toward therapeutic application and there are already 12 ongoing RNAi clinical trials . Compared to 66.5% of gene therapy clinical trials aiming at the treatment of cancer, only 2 of the 12 siRNA clinical trials are designed for cancer therapy, indicating the siRNA cancer therapy is still in its infancy. Same as the ther- apeutic application of pDNA, the major bottleneck for a successful siRNA therapy is the efficient delivery. Scientists have gained extensive experiences in the delivery of pDNA and these experiences can be utilized for the delivery of plasmid-based shRNA. However, the same experience cannot be transferred to siRNA directly since siRNA is very different from pDNA in terms of the molecular weight, molecular topography, and in vivo stability. In addition, compared to pDNA, siRNA is more difficult to be condensed into nanosized complex. Nevertheless, many nonviral vectors have been developed for siRNA delivery and one of them was recently approved for phase I clinical trial. Generally, in order to develop an effective siRNA drug for cancer therapy, there are three primary requirements: (i) targeted delivery of siRNA to the tumor site in the body, (ii) passage of the siRNA through cell membrane, and (iii) targeting at a specific gene which is crucial in the tumorgenesis. For the targeted delivery, numerous ligands have been employed on the surface of the siRNA delivery system. The most promising ligands are antibody fragments, aptamers, and peptide which can bind to specific antigen on the tumor cell surface. In addition, PEG surface modification is necessary to overcome the pharmacokinetic problems associated with cationic complexes, such as the nonspecific protein binding and uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Furthermore, all siRNA delivery system should contain a cationic group to condense siRNA into nanosized particles, as well as to enhance the cellular uptake. Specificity of siRNA is another important issue in its therapeu- tic application since many siRNAs can induce off-target effects and nonspecific RNA Interference for Cancer Therapy 431 immunoresponses. Careful designing and backbone modification have been proved to be the best approaches to address these limitations. In summary, we should look forward to successful clinical reports of siRNA cancer therapies and results from ongoing clinical trials will help us in further understanding and developing siRNA-based therapeutics against cancer in the near future.

Cheng and B. Qin MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer Guofeng Cheng, Michael Danquah, and Ram I. Mahato 1 Introduction MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered family of endogenous, non- coding RNA molecules approximately 22 nt in length [1]. They modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to the complementary sequence in the coding or 30 untranslated region of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [1]. miRNAs are transcribed from genomic DNA by RNA polymerase II but not further translated into protein (non-coding RNA). Eventually, they are pro- cessed from primary transcripts known as pri-miRNAs to short stem-loop structures called pre-miRNA and finally to become functionally mature miRNA. Mature miRNA molecules are partially complimentary to target mRNA where they either repress translation or direct destructive cleavage [2]. The first miRNA was described in 1993 by Lee and colleagues, who found miRNA-lin-4 is essential for the normal temporal control of diverse post- embryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans by negatively regulating the level of LIN-14 protein via antisense RNA–RNA interaction [3]. miRNAs have a large-scale effect as a new layer of gene regulation mechanism. It has been estimated that the vertebrate genome encodes up to 1000 unique miRNAs, which can regulate expression of at least 30% of genes [4, 5]. Cancer is an intricate genetic disease attributed to the breakdown of gene regulatory networks governing the balance between oncogenes and tumor- suppressor genes. That cancer results from a deregulation of this highly regu- lated network suggests the use of gene modulation as a therapeutic approach for treating cancer. To date, several approaches such as antisense oligonucleotides (ODN), aptamers, ribozymes, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been explored as tools for modulating the production of aberrant proteins. Recent evidence indicates that miRNAs play an important role in cancer pathogenesis by functioning as novel oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes and altered R.I.

Since miRNAs are powerful regulators of gene expression and can regulate more than one target, they have the potential to serve as a new class of therapeutic targets for treating cancer by artificially manipulating their expression levels. This chapter highlights the role of miRNAs in the initiation and progression of human cancer, their utility as diagnostics and prognostics and focuses on the potential of miRNAs as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. We also describe the current strategies for modulating miRNAs to exploit them as therapeutics. 2 Gene Regulation 2.1 Type of Nucleic Acids Used for Gene Modulation One of the major developments in modern biomedical research resulting from the fields of molecular biology and genetics is gene modulation- based gene therapy. During the past 30 years, several approaches of gene regulation have been developed to artificially alter the expression of a given gene (Fig. 1). These include antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), triplex- DNA RNA Protein Aptamer siRNA duplex TFO Ribozymes and DNAzymes ODN AAAAA Fig. 1 Schematic representation of gene modulation by TFO, ODN, Ribozymes, DNAzymes, siRNA duplex, and aptamer 442 G. Cheng et al. forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), aptamers, ribozymes and DNAzymes, and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Among them, aptamers can regulate endo- genous gene expression at both genomic and transcription levels [9]. TFOs and ODNs can exert their functions through binding the promoter region or open reading frame of target regions [10]. Ribozymes and DNAzymes can cataly- tically cleave the target gene [9]. All current approaches for gene regulation have been applied to selectively turn off specific genes in diseased tissue. This blockage of active target molecules by gene regulation has a potential to be developed into efficacious gene therapies for human diseases. Recently, RNA interference (RNAi), which is small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated spe- cific gene silencing has become an important tool for analyzing gene function at the transcription level [11] and also provides a potentially therapeutic tool for treating genetic or acquired disease [12]. 2.2 RNA Interference RNAi was first described in C. elegans in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello, who demonstrated substantially more effective gene silencing using dsRNA than either strand individually [11]. As per RNAi, introduc- tion of dsRNA into organism results into the 21- or 22-nt dsRNA frag- mentsthatbear2-or3-nt30 overhangs upon cleavage by Dicer. These 21-nt dsRNAs, which are referred to as siRNAs, are then selectively incorpo- rated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Then a RISC under- goes an ATP-dependent activation step that involves unwinding of the double-stranded siRNA component to give a single-stranded guide RNA that targets RISC to homologous mRNAs. After mRNA binding, a RISC cleaves the target mRNA at the center of the region that is complementary to the guide RNA. dsRNAs can be produced by first chemical synthesis and the following in vitro annealing or are transcribed by plasmid or viral vectors encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Due to its high specificity and efficiency, extensive efforts have led to the development of this tech- nique as a potentially therapeutic strategy through gene regulation at the transcription level. 2.3 miRNA Versus siRNA Both siRNA and miRNA are small RNAs of 18–25 nt in length that exert their functions by incorporating into related RISCs (Fig. 2). However, unlike siRNA, miRNAs are a class of endogenous molecules that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from genomic DNA. In the nucleus, miRNA are usually transcribed by RNA polymerase II into pri-miRNAs which are large precur- sor RNAs. These transcripts are then processed by an RNase III enzyme MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 443 Drosha and its double-stranded binding domain protein Pasha into \u000270 nt long stem-loop structures known as pre-miRNAs [13– 15]. The pre-miRNAs are then exported out of the nucleus by the GTP-driven exportin 5 transpor- ter and further processed by the RNase III Dicer-TRBP microprocessor complex in the cytoplasm [16– 18]. This results in the release of a double- stranded RNA duplex composed of the mature miRNA bound to its complementary strand. The mature miRNA strand is separated from its complement due to differences in thermodynamic stability at the 5 0 end and loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where it has the capa- city to regulate target genes; the unused strand is degraded [19]. The bound mRNAs either remain untranslated resulting in a decrease in the proteins they encode or are degraded by the RISC resulting in a decreased number of tran- scripts. miRNAs are involved in numerous cellular processes including pri-miRNA pre-miRNA miRNA gene CytoplasmNucleus siRNA duplex Unwind and RISC incorporated Asymmetric RISC Assembly Ribosome complex mRNA mRNA RISC RISC Translation repression mRNA degradation miRNA duplex Dicer a b c Fig. 2 The biogenesis and function of miRNAs and siRNA pathway. (a) The primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) is transcribed from genome by RNA polymerase II, then is processed into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by the Drosha/Pasha microprocessor complex and exported to cytoplasm by exportin-5. (b) pre-miRNA becomes a bioactive miRNA duplex upon removing the loop by Dicer. The miRNA duplex is unwinded into single-stranded mature miRNA, which is subsequently incorporated into related RISC. Asymmetric RISC including mature miRNA inhibits the translation of the target gene or cleaves mRNA of target gene. (c) Upon arrival in the cytoplasm, siRNA duplex is unwinded and the guide siRNA strand is incorporated into related RISC. The RISC specifically degrades the mRNA of target gene 444 G. Cheng et al. development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and the stress response [20]. As to siRNA-mediated RNAi, it is an evolutionary mechanism for protecting the genome against invasion by mobile genetic elements such as transposons and viruses. siRNAs directly trigger a sequence-specific post- transcriptional degradation of homologous genes by binding to its complemen- tary mRNA, which is not limited to 30 UTR. The siRNA sequence is required to strictly complement with target mRNA. It is recently noted that siRNA- mediated gene silencing could induce unwanted off-target effect and immune response. 3 Identification of miRNA Targets As mentioned above, miRNAs function by binding to complementary sites on target mRNAs to induce cleavage or repression of productive translation. As such, identification of miRNA targets is a key step for analyzing miRNA function in organisms. Up to now, some miRNA targets have been identified and their functions assigned. For example, the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs control developmental timing in C. elegans [21, 22]; lsy-6 miRNA regulates left–right asymmetry in the nervous system [23]; bantam miRNA controls tissue growth [24]; bantam and miR-14 control apoptosis [24]; miR-181 is involved in hema- topoietic differentiation [25]; miR-375 regulates insulin secretion [26]; and miR- 373 and miR-520c stimulate cancer cell migration and invasion [27]. Computational prediction of miRNA targets provides an alternative approach to assigning biological functions of miRNAs. Several softwares with different governing algorithms have been developed and applied for prediction of a large number of targets genes for miRNA as listed in Table 1. In the following section, we introduce some of the softwares used for the prediction of miRNA targets. TargetScan is an algorithm developed by Lewis et al. for predicting miRNA targets in vertebrates [28]. Using this software, genes involved in tran- scriptional regulation were enriched even though the functions of the predicted target genes encompassed a broad range of activities. TargetScans criterion for target detection involves the existence of perfect complementarity to the ‘‘seed- region’’ of miRNA and the degree of complementarity of surrounding regions. Later, the authors improved the TargetScan algorithm and developed it into TargetScanS [5]. This updated software successfully predicated all of the known miRNA–target interaction and has been used in the prediction of over 5300 human genes as potential targets of miRNAs. The miRanda software was initially designed to predict miRNA target genes in Drosophila melanogaster [29] and utilizes dynamic programming to rapidly identify sites with a high-degree of miRNA complementarity. This software was also applied for prediction of human miRNA in targets [29, 30]. About 2000 putative human miRNA target genes were identified, suggesting that 10% or more of human genes are regulated by miRNAs. The RNAhybrid program presented by Rehmsmeier et al.,which is MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 445 the identification target miRNA based on energetically optimal binding sites for a small RNA within a large RNA sequences [31], can predict known and new miRNA targets. Because cross-species comparisons provide powerful criteria for identifying miRNA target genes, Kerk et al. developed Pic Tar algorithm to compare a group of orthologous 3 0UTR from multiple species and retain the 3 0UTRs with seeding match for miRNAs [32]. Then those candidate targets were further filtered according to their thermodynamic stability. They utilized this method to predict vertebrate miRNA targets and suggested that about 200 transcripts are regulated by a single miRNA. Yousef et al. also presented a machine learning approach for predicting miRNA target site based on the naı¨ ve Bayer (NB) classifiers [33]. They used the classifier as a filter for the output of the miRanda tool and demonstrated that the filtering step decreases the false- positive prediction by miRanda significantly. Calculation of mRNA secondary structures and favorable hybridization between miRNA and target mRNA can also be used to predict miRNA target such as RNAhybrid [31] and STarMir [34]. The microRNA.org site (http://www.microrna.org) is a resource for miRNA target predictions and miRNA expression that is widely used by the research community [35]. Other annotated miRNA databases such as miRBase [36], miRGen [37], Argonaute [38], miRNAMap [39], and smiRNAdb [40] could also provide some valuable information for predicting miRNA target. Experimental validation of predicated miRNA targets is crucial for under- standing miRNA functions as well as the biological significance of results from computational prediction. This is necessary since computational methods are not warranted due to the associated risk of false-positive prediction. Although experimental validation of miRNA target genes is challenging compared to computational validation, more and more miRNA target genes from various species have been identified using a combination of computational and biolo- gical approaches. Experimental validation is performed against two types of predicted miRNA targets that have different regulatory mechanisms: transla- tional repression of target mRNAs and cleavage of target mRNAs.

Cheng et al. such as reporter gene [41– 43], gene mutation [44– 46], rapid amplification of 50 complementary DNA end (5 0 RACE) [47], and proteomics [48] have been applied for experimental validation of computationally predicated miRNA targets that are translationally regulated. In addition, microarray analysis, which provides a powerful and high-throughput method for observing cleaved target mRNAs, was also used to identify a large number of human miRNA targets that appear to be cleaved by miRNAs [49]. Recently, German et al. directly sequenced miRNA–mRNA pairs and identified miRNA targets from the mRNA cleaved site, which provided a novel method for predicting miRNA target [50]. However, there is no clear agreement as to which experimental procedures should be followed to demonstrate a predicated miRNA target is a target of specific miRNA. It is therefore necessary to experimentally confirm predicated targets by using a combination of techniques. 4 Roles of miRNAs in Cancer 4.1 miRNA Profile in Cancer Several studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in cancers since they regulate the expression of genes responsible for cell growth and apoptosis [6, 7]. Calin and coworkers were the first to provide evidence regarding the involve- ment of miRNAs in cancers based on a study characterizing the frequently deleted and downregulated chromosome 13q14 in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [51]. They observed that this chromosome which is deleted in a majority of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia contained two miRNAs: miR-15 and miR-16. Subsequently, numerous studies have been undertaken to identify the differentially expressed miRNAs between cancer and normal tissues to further understand their biological functions in tumor development. Because miRNA array technology allows hundreds of miRNAs to be studied simultaneously and enables the observation of altered profiles, investigation of miRNA profiles between cancer and normal tissues were initially carried out by miRNA array to identify miRNAs functions. To date, several microarray- based approaches have been used for miRNA profiling analysis. These include miChip which is a microarray platform for identifying miRNA expression profiles based on locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotide capture probes [52], an oligonucleotide microarray [53], and a novel bead-based flow cyto- metric technique designed by Lu et al. Using this novel technique, Lu and colleagues analyzed the expression of 217 miRNAs in 332 tissue samples, including many different types of tumors [54]. The miRNA expression profile seems to be tissue specific: different types of tumors have distinctive patterns of miRNA expression, and the miRNA profiles also reflect the developmental origin of tissues [54] as indicated in Table 2. In the following section, we highlight some representative miRNA MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 447Table2LossofsomemiRNAexpressionprofilesincancerTumors/CellsmiRNAprofilesIdentifiedmethodsCommentsReferencesB-cellchroniclymphocyticleukemia(B-CLL)MiR-123,miR-220,andmiR-192downMiR-190,miR-183-prec,miR-33,miR-19a,miR-140,miR-123,miR-10b,miR-15b-prec,miR-92-1,miR-188,miR-154,miR-227,miR-101,miR-141-prec,miR-153-prec,miR-196-2,miR-134,miR-141,miR-132,andmiR-181b-precupMicroarray,confirmedbynorthernblotandreal-timeRT-PCRmiRNAprofilesareassociatedwithbiologicalbehaviorandprognosisinB-CLL146GlioblastomaMiR-128,miR-181a,miR-181b,andmiR-181cdownMiR-221upMicroarray,confirmedbynorthernblotThealternationofmiRNAsisassociatedwithglioblastoma147BreastcancermiR-125b,miR-145,miR-21,andmiR-155downMicroarray,confirmedbynorthernblotmiRNAsexpressioncorrelateswithspecificbreastcancerbiopathologicfeatures115HepatocellularcarcinomaMiR-92,miR-20,miR-18,miR-99a,andmiR-18precupMicroarray,confirmedbynorthernblotmiRNAsarepotentiallyinvolvedintheprogressoflivertumor148LungcancerMiR-21,miR-191,miR-210,miR-155,miR-205,miR-24-2,miR-212,miR-214,andmiR-17-3precupMiR-126,miR-143,miR-192prec,miR-224,miR-126,miR-30a-5prec,miR-140,andmiR-9downMicroarray,confirmedbyreal-timeRT-PCRmiRNAexpressionprofilescouldbediagnosticandprognosticmarkersoflungcancer149ColorectalcancerMiR-19a,miR-21,miR-29a,miR-92,miR-148a,andmiR-200bupMiR-30c,miR-133a,andmiR-145downReal-timePCRmiRNAprofileshasrelevancetothebiologicalandclinicalbehaviorofcolorectalneoplasia58 448 G.

Cheng et al. profiles in cancer. Pallante et al. analyzed the genome-wide miRNA expression profile in human thyroid papillary carcinomas (PTCs) using a miRNACHIP microarray containing hundreds of human precursor and mature miRNA oligonucleotide probes [55]. Using this approach, they found an aberrant miRNA expression profile that clearly differentiates PTCs from normal thyroid tissues. In particular, a significant increase in miR-221, miR-222, and miR-181b was detected in PTCs in comparison with normal thyroid tissue. They also functionally studied the miR-221, and reported a miRNA signature associated with PTCs, and also suggested miRNA deregulation as an important event in thyroid cell transformation. Iorio et al. used microarray to identify miRNA profiles in human ovarian cancer and found that miR-200a, miR-141, miR-200c, and miR-200b were the most significantly overexpressed, whereas miR-199a, miR-140, miR-145,and miR-125b1 were the most downmodulated miRNAs [56]. Unique miRNA signatures distinguishing between benign tumors and carci- noma tumors has also been established for prostate cancer. For example, Porkka et al. investigated differentially expressed miRNAs between prostate benign tumors and carcinomas tumors using an oligonucleotide array hybridi- zation method. Fifty-one differentially expressed miRNAs were detected, 37 of them were downregulated while 14 miRNAs were upregulated in carcinoma tumors and indicated that those miRNAs could be significant in prostate cancer development and/or growth [57]. Bandre´ s et al. examined the expression of 156 mature miRNA in colorectal cancer by real-time PCR and the results suggested that miRNA expression profile could be relevant to the biological and clinical behavior of colorectal neoplasia [58]. Michael et al. identified 28 different miRNAs in a colonic adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa by using miRNA cloning and northern blotting. They also indicated that miR-143 and miR-145 are downregulated in cells derived from breast, prostate, cervical, and lymphoid cancers as well as colorectal tumors [59]. Because colorectal cancer develops through two differently pathological pathways, Lanza et al. used miRNA microarray chip to investigate different miRNA profiles of colorectal cancer between two differently pathological pathways. They reported the presence of 27 differently expressed gene, includ- ing 8 miRNAs and showed that their functions were most frequently associated with cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, repair, gastrointestinal dis- ease, and immune response [60]. Within a single developmental cell lineage such as acute lymphoblastic leu- kaemia, distinct patterns of miRNA expression can also be observed that represent different mechanisms of transformation [61]. Zanette et al. determined miRNA expression profile of chronic and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (CCL and ALL) using TagMan MicroRNA Assay Human Panel [62]. The five most highly expressed miRNAs were miR-128b, miR-204, miR-218, miR-331, and miR-181b-1 in ALL, and miR-331, miR-29a, miR-195, miR-34a, and miR-29c in CLL [62]. Using cloning and quantitative real-time PCR, miR-21 and miR-155 have been confirmed to be highly overexpressed in the patients with CLL [63]. MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 451 Taken together, miRNA expression profiles in cancer provides important clues for further understanding tumor development/metastases as well as for diagnosis and prognosis. The levels of some miRNAs are reduced in tumors with poor cell differentiation, reflecting the role of miRNAs in cell differentia- tion in cancer tissues. Conversely, the levels of some miRNAs are increased in tumors, potentially indicating the role of miRNAs as oncogenes. Consequently, investigation of miRNAs that are enriched in tumor but not normal tissues, or vice versa, may identify miRNA-regulated genes involved in human cancer. If the levels of miRNAs in cancer cells, relative to normal tissues, are different, it is important to identify those genes that are regulated by these miRNAs and to see how these altered expressions influence the development of malignancy. The study of tumor suppressor and oncogene miRNA targets using computational prediction softwares and carrying out experiments for validation, should further our understanding of tumor development or metastases. Given the number of miRNAs and genes, it remains to be determined whether each miRNA can target the exact genes and genetic pathways under miRNA control in tumorigenesis. 4.2 miRNA Roles in Tumorigenesis With extensive investigation of miRNA profiles between cancer and normal tissues, specific miRNAs have been suggested to be associated with tumor initiation, promotion, and progression as called tumorigenesis. Some miRNAs involved in tumorigenesis are summarized in Table 3. lin-4 and let-7 which control the timing of fate specification of neuronal and hypodermal cells in C. elegans during larval development was the first evidence of miRNAs invol- vement in cell proliferation [21]. Human let-7 shows diminished expression in lung tumors, whereas Ras is overexpressed, which is an oncogene regulated by let-7miRNA. Moreover, overexpression of let-7 in lung cancer cell lines decreases growth rates [64]. Recently, a published study by Schultz et al. indicated that the members of let-7 miRNA family are downregulated in primary melanomas and demonstrated that let-7b represses expression of cyclins D1, D3, Cdk4, and CyclinA and consequently effects cell-cycle pro- gression and anchorage-independent growth [65]. Additionally, Shell et al. demonstrated that the expression of let-7 can define two differentiation stages of cancer using ovarian cancer as a model [66], suggesting that let-7 is involved in tumor development at the specific manner. It is interesting to note that let-7 miRNA family can suppress non-small cell development in lung tumor [67], suggesting that let-7 acts as a tumor suppressor. These studies further provide clear evidences to support that miRNAs regulate tumor development. Sem- pere et al. observed that the mammalian ortholog of C. elegans lin-28,which is downregulated by lin-4 in worms, was also repressed during neuronal differ- entiation of mammalian embryonal carcinoma cells and indicated that 452 G.

MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 453 mammalian lin-28 messenger RNAs contain conserved predicted binding sites in their 30-UTR regions for neuron-expressed mir-125b, let-7a, mir-218 [68]. This result suggested miRNAs (let-7, mir-125b, let-7a,and mir-218) could be involved in tumor differentiation via binding to 30 untranslated regions of target gene. Recent evidence strongly suggests miR-373 and miR-520c are involved in stimulating cancer cell migration and invasion, indicating that those miRNAs can promote cancer metastasis [27]. Apart from downregulated miRNAs, upregulated miRNAs are also asso- ciated with tumorigenesis. It is well established that miR-17-92 polycistron is located in chromosome 13q31 that is amplified in human B-cell lymphomas. He et al. demonstrated that miRNA-17-92 cluster can cooperate with oncogene gene c-Myc, which is a oncogenic transcription factor, to promote tumor development [69]. To further reveal mechanism behind this phenomenon, O’Donnell et al. also investigated the interaction between miR-17-92 cluster with Myc [70]. They found that Myc directly binds to miR-17-92 locus on chromosome 13 and activates expression of the miRNA cluster and also shows that two miRNAs from this cluster (miR-17-5p and miR-20a) negatively regulate expression of E2F1 transcription factor, which is an additional target of Myc that promotes cell-cycle progression. Further evidence provided by Chang and coworkers revealed that c-Myc can regulate a much broader set of miRNAs than previously anticipated and indicated that much of this repression is likely to be a direct result of Myc binding to miRNA promoters [71]. In addition, Hayashita et al. observed that the overexpression of miR-17-92 is associated with the enhancement of cell proliferation in human lung cancers [72]. Wang et al. indicated that miR-17-92 cluster can accelerate adipocyte differentiation by negatively regulating tumor-suppressor gene Rb2/p130 [73]. Recently published results indicated that miR-17 polycistron (miR-17-18-19-20- 92) with transcript factor Myc can synergistically contribute to tumor develop- ment, probably by repressing tumor-suppressor genes [74]. Using transgenic mice to overexpress mir-17-92 cluster in embryonic lung epithelium, it has been observed that mir-17-92 promotes the high proliferation and undifferentiated phenotype of lung epithelial progenitor cells [75]. Another well-characterized miRNA-miR-21, which is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers, will be introduced in the section of miRNAs as oncogenes. miR-34a has been demonstrated to target MYCN, which is commonly found to be amplified in neuroblastoma as well as brain tumor [76], breast tumor [77], and cervix cancer [78]. Wei and coworkers demonstrated that miR-34a causes significant decrease of cell growth through increased apoptosis and inhibited DNA synthesis [79], suggesting that miR-34a is a tumor-suppressor miRNA. Further studies indicated miR-34, miR-34b, and miR-34c can cooperate with p53 tumor suppressor in control of tumor growth and development [80, 81]. The expression of miR-34a could lead to cell apoptosis by p53-dependent pathway. Conversely, perturbation of miR-34a expression, as occurs in some human cancers, could contribute to tumorigenesis [82]. In addition, Welch et al. also demonstrated that miR-34a functions as a potential tumor suppressor by 454 G. Cheng et al. inducing apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell though targeting E2F3 protein, which is a potent transcriptional inducer of cell-cycle progression [83]. However, Dutta et al. indicated that the overexpression of miR-34a can also be observed in various types of human cancers such as mucinous adenocarcinoma and infiltrating papillary carcinoma, which is associated with cell proliferation [84]. Those results suggest that even one miRNA probably has different roles in different type of cancer. So far, the main epigenetic alternations in cancer are aberrant DNA hyper- methylation of tumor-suppressor genes, global genomic DNA hypomethyla- tion, and disruption of the histone modification patterns, which result in inappropriate cellular proliferation and survival. The epigenetic modification could attribute to miRNA-mediated tumorigenesis due to the downregulated expression of miRNAs that are considered as tumor-suppressor gene [56, 85]. For example, miR-127 and miR-124a are transcriptionally inactivated by CpG island hypermethylatin in colorectal cancer [86], whereas in lung cancer, the overexpression of miRNA with oncogenic function, let-7a-3, seems to be due to DNA hypomethylation [87]. Overall, the upregulated miRNAs with oncogenic function in caner could be considered oncogenic miRNAs, named as oncomirs. The downregulated miRNAs with tumor-suppressor function could be considered as tumor- suppressor miRNAs. We will discuss the most well-understood oncomirs and tumor-suppressor miRNAs in the following sections. 4.3 miRNAs as Oncogenes miRNAs act as oncogenes by inhibiting the expression of tumor suppressors or by downregulating genes that inhibit the activity of known oncogenes [88]. Table 4 summarizes some well-characterized oncogenic miRNAs. miR-155, which is a product of the BIC transcript, was the first oncomir discovered and it has been shown to be upregulated in many solid tumors as well as in leukemias and lymphomas [89]. In an avian model, oncogenic cooperation between the BIC and the MYC genes in lymphomagenesis and erythroleukemogenesis has been observed, indicating that MYC and BIC might cooperate in human tumors [90]. Costinean and coworkers developed the first transgenic mouse that specifically overexpresses miR-155 in B cells, thus modeling the human B-cell leukemia where the upregulation of miR-155 is observed. The transgenic mice developed poly- clonal pre-leukemia B-cell type followed by B-cell malignancy. However, the death of these mice is not an early event, suggesting that miR-155 deregulation needs additional genetic alterations for the development of the fully malignant phenotype [91]. The best characterized oncogenic miRNA is miR-17-92 cluster. This miRNA cluster is encoded by a polycistronic transcript from the chromosome 13 open reading frame 25. miR-17-92 cluster interacts with c-myc, which is MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 455Table4ListofsomemiRNAsasoncogenesmiRNATumorsEffectfactors/proposedtargetsFunctions/ObservationReferencesmiR-17-92clustersHumanB-celllymphomasc-mycmiRNAscanmodulatetumorformation69miR-373/520cTesticulargermcelltumorsCD44miRNAsstimulatecancercellmigrationandinvasion27miR-10bBreastcancerTwistmiR-10bpositivelyregulatescellmigrationandinvasion92miR-221/222ProstatecarcinomaKip1TheoverexpressionofthesemiRNAsprobablycontributetotheoncogenesisandprogressionofprostatecarcinoma97miR-372/373TesticularGermCellTumorsLATS2ThesemiRNAsneutralizep53-mediatedCDKinhibition98miR-21NumbersoftumorsPTENorTPM1miR-21suppressestheexpressionoftumor-suppressorgene93,95LAST2–largetumorsuppressor2;PTEN–phosphataseandtensinhomolog;TPM1–tumor-suppressortropomyosin-1. 456 G. Cheng et al. pathologically activated in many human cancers, to accelerate tumor devel- opment [69]. miR-10b has also been shown to positively regulate cells migra- tion and invasion in breast cancer upon inducing by transcription factor twist [92]. Both the overexpression of miR-17-92 and miR-10b results from the oncogenic transcript factors binding with genome and initiating mRNA transcript. miR-21, which is another well-characterized oncogenic miRNA, is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancer and has been demonstrated to be linked to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration. Knockdown of miR-21 in cultured glioblastoma cells triggers activation of caspase activity, leading to increased apoptotic cell death. In addition, the disruption of miR-21 affects the glioma growth in vivo. Si et al. demonstrated that miR-21 canpromote growth of thebreastcancercelllineMCF-7 bothinvitro andin vivo, which may be due to the ability of miR-21 to suppress the expression of the tumor-suppressor PTEN and tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) [93– 95]. miR-21 can also target and downregulate the expression of sprouty 2 and inhibit the cell of outgrowth [96]. Galardi et al. indicated that miR-221/222 can be a new family of oncogenes, directly targeting the tumor-suppressor p27(Kip1), and that their overexpression might be one of the factors contributing to the oncogen- esis and progression of prostate carcinoma through p27(Kip1) downregula- tion [97]. Some oncogenic miRNAs control tumor development by mediating the expression of tumor-suppressor genes such as p53 and TPM1. For example, Voorhoeve et al. demonstrated that miR-372/373 neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition and then potentially become novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors [98]. On the other side, some miRNAs can also regulate tumor development by adjusting the activities of some kinases. For example, miR-106-363 cluster potentially regulates homeodo- main-interacting protein kinase 3 and then promotes cancer metastasis [99]. 4.4 miRNAs as Tumor Suppressors miRNAs function as tumor suppressors by inhibiting the expression of onco- genes and then blocking tumorigenesis as summarized in Table 5. miRNA- let-7 has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in extensive tumors including lung cancers [64], colorectal [100] and breast cancers [101], and leiomyoma [102]. Now it has been demonstrated that, let-7 can regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and transformation by suppressing the expression of Ras and high-mobility group A2 (HMGA2), which are kind of oncogenes [64, 102]. Disruption of the pairing between let-7 and HMGA2 can enhance onco- genic transformation [103]. Furthermore, the introduction of let-7 miRNA by intranasal administration can suppress the growth and formation of lung tumor in xenografts mice [104]. These observations suggest let-7 miRNA may be useful as a therapeutic agent in cancer.

Cheng et al. miRNAs can also downregulate the expression of antiapoptotic proteins or kinases in cancer by serving as tumor suppressors. For example, Cimmino et al. demonstrated that miR-15 and miR-16 can induce apoptosis by targeting anti- apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (BCL2), which is a central player in the genetic program of eukaryotic cells favoring survival by inhibiting cell death in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [105]. miR-29 can induce tumor cell apop- tosis by negatively regulating Mcl-1 protein expression, which belongs to BCL2 protein family [105, 106]. Kim et al. documented that miR-199a regulates not only the Met-proto-oncogene but also the downstream extracellular signal- regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), leading to tumor cell apoptosis [107]. Recently, miR-7 has been identified a new tumor suppressor by suppressing epidermal growth factor receptor expression (EGFR) and inhibiting the Akt pathway via targeting upstream regulators such as Ras 1 or Ras 2 [108]. miRNAs can also regulate the expression of enzymes involved DNA methy- lation and then control tumor development. For example, Fabbri et al. demon- strated that miR-29 family including miR-29a, b, and c, which is downregulated in tumor cells line, target DNA methyltransferase 3A and 3B. The enforced expression of miR-29 in lung tumor induces reexpression of methylation- silenced tumor-suppressor gene and inhibits tumorigensis both in vitro and in vivo [109]. 5 miRNA for Diagnosis and Prognosis in Cancer Patients miRNA expression profiling using bead-based flow cytometry, northern blot analyses, RT-PCR, and miRNA microarrays has been used to demonstrate distinct expressions of specific miRNAs in certain tumor tissues [49, 54, 110– 113]. These characteristic miRNA signatures suggest that miRNAs have the potential to be used as diagnostic and prognostic tools, especially since they are more informative in distinguishing between cancer types and for determining cancer metastases when compared with traditional biomarkers. For example, Lu et al. used a novel bead-based flow cytometry miRNA expression profiling method to analyze the systematic expression of 217 mammalian miRNAs in normal and human cancer samples. Overall, they observed a downregulation of the miRNAs in tumors compared with normal tissues. Additionally, Lu and coworkers were able to classify poorly differentiated tumors using expression profiles of relatively few miRNA [54]. Furthermore, Chen et al. showed that miR-181, miR-223, and miR-142 s were overexpressed in hematopoietic tissues using northern blot analysis [25]. Using real-time PCR to analyze the expression of miR-21 in 37 gastric patients, Chan et al. found a 92% overexpression of miR-21 in tumor tissue, demonstrating the potential of miR-21 as diagnostic marker for gastric cancer [114]. With the application of oligonucleotide micro- chips, Croce’s group observed unique miRNA signatures for human breast cancer, human megakaryocytopoiesis, and B-cell CLL [115, 116]. MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 459 miRNA signatures can also provide useful information for determining prognosis in patients with cancer. For example, in ovarian cancer the expression of let-7 and HMGA2 is a better predictor of disease progression than classical markers such as E-cadherin, vimentin, and snail [66]. Also, the high expression of miR-21 has been linked with poor survival and therapeutic response in patients with colon adenocarcinoma [117]; while high expression of miR-191 and miR-199a in acute myeloid leukemia patients correlated with poor prog- nosis compared with those with low expression [118]. Guo and coworkers have also shown that a high expression of miR-103/107 leads to low survival in patients with esophageal cancer [119]. Another example of miRNA expression and cancer prognosis is the high miR-155 expression and low let-7a-2 expression resulting in poor survival in the patients with lung cancer. It is important to note, that some miRNA signatures are efficient diagnostic markers but poor indicators of clinical prognosis. For example, Chan et al. used quantitative PCR to examine the expression level of miR-21 in 37 patients with gastric cancer and found miR-21 to be an efficient diagnostic marker, but a poor prognostic tool for gastric cancer [114]. Taken together, distinct miRNA sig- natures can be used as cancer diagnostics and to foretell prognosis. However, there is still a long way to adopt this technology clinically since the function of unique miRNAs differently expressed in different tumors should first be well understood. 6 Therapeutic Implication of miRNAs Many cancer types are characterized by an aberrant expression of miRNAs and as such represent a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Presently, two technologies adapted from gene therapy and RNAi technology may be used to alter the levels of expression of miRNAs. In the first approach, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) can be used to inhibit the effects of miRNA by speci- fically binding with target miRNA and then blocking its normal function, while in the second approach, cancer causing miRNAs can be replaced by vectors overexpressing a specific miRNA or by transiently transfected double-stranded miRNAs. 6.1 miRNA Inhibition Inhibition of miRNA can be achieved by introducing antisense molecules targeting mature miRNA or introducing siRNA/shRNA to silence the various components involved in miRNA processing. 460 G. Cheng et al. 6.1.1 miRNA Inhibition Using Modified Antisense Oligonucleotide ASO-based gene therapy has been clinically applied for human disease [120]. Now it also was extended for silencing miRNA. To the best of our knowledge, the first reported study on miRNAs silencing by using ASO was presented by Boutla et al. in 2003 [121]. In this study, the authors synthesized 11 DNA oligonucleotides complementary to 11 miRNAs and then injected them into Drosophila embryos, then a variety of developmental defects were observed, suggesting that these oligonucleotides inhibited miRNA activity and could become a potential target for treating cancer by inhibiting oncogenic miRNA. To improve potency for the target nucleic acid, resistance to endogenous nuclease, or improved activation of RNase H or other protein involved in the terminating mechanism, several strategies have been applied to modify ASO for silencing a given gene [12]. The first generation of ASO was designed to resist nuclease attack by replacing one of the non-bridging oxygen atoms in the phosphate group of ASO with either sulfur or a methyl group [122]. However, this modification leads to several side effects due to unspecific interaction and poor solubility in water [123]. Then, sugars were also modified by adding O- methyl, fluro, O-propyl, O-allyl or other groups at the 20 position to increase affinity for RNA and impart some nuclease stability, named as the second generation of ASO [124]. Additionally, 30-hydroxyl group of the 20-deoxyribose has been replaced with a 30-amino group for ASO, named as N30!P50 phos- phoramidates, and shown a very high-binding affinity to complementary DNA or RNA [125]. To date, phosphorothioate and/or 20 sugar modified ASO has also been used to silence miRNA (Fig. 3). To the best of our knowledge, the first report to use (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 3 Chemically modified ASOs that have been used for anti-miRNA. (a) Unmodified ASO. (b) Chemically modified ASO with phosphorothioate backbone (R1 position) and 20 sugar modification such as 2 0-O-methyl, 2 0-O-methyoxyethyl, and 2 0-flouro (R2 position). (c) Locked nucleic acid. (d) Morpholino MicroRNAs as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer 461 modified ASO to silence miRNA was presented by Hutvagner et al. and cow- orkers in 2004 [126]. They injected the 20-O-methyl modified ASO, which is complementary to the miRNA let-7, leading to a let-7 loss-of-function pheno- copy in C. elegans [126]. Davis et al. systematically evaluated the correlation between ASO with 20-sugar and 20-F modified backbone and its potency target- ing miRNA and demonstrated that ASO modification improve miRNA ASO activity by improving target affinity [127]. They also noted that the positioning of high-affinity modifications had dramatically different effects on miRNA activity. Locked nucleic acid (LNA) modified oligonucleotides have been used as sensitive and specific miRNA detection probes in northern blots due to its high efficiency for binding targeting sequence [128]. Then LNA modified nucleotide has been shown to have specific and long-lasting silencing effect on miRNA in cell lines [129, 130]. Fontana et al. used 20-O-methyl modified antagomir targeting miR-17-5p-92 and demonstrated that both in vitro and in vivo treatments with antagomir-17-5p abolishe the growth of MYCN-amplified and therapy-resistant neuroblastoma through p21 and BIM upmodulation, leading to cell-cycling blockade and activation of apoptosis, respectively [131]. As we mentioned above, miR-21 has been found to be upregulated in variety of solid tumors. Transfection of breast cancer MCF-7 cells with anti- miR-21 oligonucleotide with 20-O-methyl modification suppressed cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model by increasing cell apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation [93]. All these data suggest that downregulation of miR-21 in solid tumors might be a way for tumor regression. Apart from modified ASOs, which are targeting mature miRNAs, Morpholino has been shown to affect the processing of the pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA and then inhibit the activity of mature miRNA as presented by Kloosterman and coworkers [132]. In this study, they also observed that knockdown of miR-375 causes morphological defect in pancreatic islets by using Morpholino [132]. To further improve potency for targeting miRNA in vivo, modified ASOs could be conjugated with delivery agents such as cholesterols or be formulated with lipid, polymer or peptide-based delivery system (Fig. 4). Kru¨ tzfeldt et al. [133] used cholesterol to conjugate with a series of modified miRNA antisenses, named as ’antagomirs’ and demonstrated that antagomirs are efficient and specific silencers of endogenous miRNAs in mice. Intravenous administration of antagomirs against miR-16, miR-122, miR-192, and miR-194 resulted in a marked reduction of corresponding miRNA levels in most organ, suggesting that the silencing of endogenous miRNAs by this novel method is specific, efficient and long-lasting, and potentially toward therapeutic propose. They also noted that injection of unmodified single-stranded RNA targeting miR-122 had no effect on level of miR-122 in liver, whereas injection of unconjugated, but chemically modified, single-stranded RNAs with a partially modified or fully modified phosphorothioate backbone and 20-OMe sugar modification led to an incomplete effect, suggesting that modified miRNA antisenses can sig- nificantly improve potency in vivo. Fontana et al. also used 20-OMe modified, 462 G. Cheng et al. phosphorothioate backbone, and cholesterol-conjugated ASO to target miR- 17-5p-92 cluster and demonstrated that the abrogation of miR-17-5p-92 leads to cell-cycling blockade and activation of apoptosis [131]. Overall, modifica- tions of different positions of ASO including 20-hydroxyl group and backbone as well as conjugation with delivery agent could at most facilitate miRNA silencing effect. Esau and coworkers also inhibited miR-122 in normal mice by intraperito- neally injecting an unconjugated 20-MOE modified anti-miRNA oligonucleo- tide (AMO) [134]. This led to an increase in mRNA levels of miR-122 target genes and a decrease in plasma cholesterol. While the mechanism governing the reduction of miRNA by the AMOs is not clear, it is known that the AMO acts on the mature miRNAs since the levels of pre-miR-122 remain unchanged. In spite of the potential therapeutic benefits of using AMOs for treating cancer, clinical application is presently inhibited due to a lack of effective delivery of AMOs into target sites. Possible approaches to delivering AMOs include complexing them with lipids or proteins; using cationic liposomes [135, 136] or conjugating AMOs with homing signals for site-specific delivery. Recently, Akinc et al. developed a new class of lipid-like delivery molecules, termed lipidoids, as delivery agent for RNAi therapeutics and reported that lipidoids facilitate high levels of specific silencing of miRNAs when formulated with single-strand 2’-Sugar modification 2’-Sugar modification Anti-miRNA ASO Anti-miRNA ASO with chemical modifications Cholesterol-conjugated anti-miRNA ASO 5’ 3’ ∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧ ∧ ∧ * Backbone modification 3’5’ ∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧ ∧ ∧****************** **** H S H H S cholesterol O5’ ∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧∧ ∧ ∧****************** **** * Backbone modification Fig. 4 Scheme for improving ASO stability and silencing effect for miRNA.

With progress in the develop- ment of better delivery vehicles, miRNA targeting will ultimately become com- mercially available as a therapeutic agent. 6.1.2 Targeting miRNAs Processing Using Antisense Oligonucleotide Another approach for therapeutically inhibiting miRNA expression involves downregulating the various components in the miRNA biogenesis pathway to prevent the production of mature miRNA [138]. Small molecule drugs or RNAi interference can be used to achieve this by inhibiting Drosha, Dicer, and other miRNA pathway components [15, 18]. However, this therapeutic approach is often accompanied by pleiotropic effects which can be minimized by tightly controlling the expression of miRNA pathway components using a tetracycline- inducible shRNA for downregulation. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that the inhibition of components involved in the miRNA biogenesis pathway has very little effect on miRNA levels possibly due to the slow turnover of mature miRNA [15, 16]. The application of RNAi interference for silencing various component of the miRNA pathway has historically been inhibited by the fact that the miRNA/RISC complex and the hairpin pre-miRNA are not easily acces- sible by siRNA. Furthermore, since siRNA is active in the cytoplasm, it cannot be used to target pri-miRNA which is located in the nucleus. In one study, Lee and coworkers used siRNA to target the loop region of a pre-miRNA in the cytoplasm and found it to be highly inefficient requiring a very high dose compared to other mRNA targets. Since then, developing ways to obtain long-term suppression of miRNA has been the subject of intense research. One approach which may be used to target pri-miRNAs involves using ASOs utilizing the RNase H mechanism since their primary site of action is in the nucleus [139, 140]. This strategy may be valuable for inhibiting polycistronic pri-miRNAs where one ASO can be used to target the tran- scripts of pri-miRNAs and hence inhibit the processing of the mature miRNA; whereas multiple AMOs would be needed to target each miRNA individually. 6.2 miRNA Replacement As mentioned above, the replacement of cancer causing miRNAs may be used as a therapy for various cancers. This may be done by transiently transfecting double-stranded miRNA mimetics or by using vectors overexpressing a parti- cular miRNA. In both approaches, the goal is to re-establish the levels of miRNA expression occurring prior to the inception of cancer. The double- stranded miRNA mimetic introduced is equivalent to the Dicer product and 464 G. Cheng et al. analogous in its function on target mRNAs. Since double-stranded miRNA mimetics are analogous in structure to siRNAs they are subject to all the limitations associated with siRNA therapy, including the difficulty in systemic delivery to tissues and the need for modifications to enhance their stability and cellular uptake [141– 143]. An additional issue with this method is the transient nature of miRNA expression. One way of addressing this limitation is to use a gene therapy approach that results in longer lasting miRNA expression. In this approach, a plasmid or viral vector driven by a pol II or III promoter upstream of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is used to express a specific miRNA which is then loaded into RISC after being processed into mature miRNA by Dicer. The benefits associated with these constructs are their long-lasting silencing compared to double- stranded miRNA mimetics and their capacity to express multiple miRNAs from one transcript. Examples include the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) virus vectors as therapeutics for miRNA delivery to the liver and brain [144, 145]. However, the eliciting of immune response and the possibility of insertional mutagenesis has limited clinical use of AAVs and lentiviruses, respectively. 7 Concluding Remarks miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs of about 22 nt, which modulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. It has been established that miR- NAs play an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apopto- sis. Because cancer is a class of disease in which a group of cells display the trait of uncontrolled growth, invasion, and metastasis, accumulated evidence indicated that miRNAs act as an important regulator in tumorigenesis such as oncogenes, tumor-suppressor factor, or other effective factors. Unique miRNA signatures have provided useful information for diagnosis and prog- nosis in patients with cancer. Blockage of miRNAs with oncogenic function by ASO has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and proliferation. Several types of modified ASOs as well as conjugation with cholesterols or lipid-based delivery have been demonstrated to improve potency both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of tumor-suppressor miRNA by introducing plasmid encoding miRNA or infecting lentivirus encoding miRNAs can sup- press tumor development. Although miRNA therapeutic modulation is potentially attractive for treat- ing cancer as well as diagnosis and prognosis, there is still a great need to deeply understand the roles of miRNA in tumorigenesis. It is also necessary to develop an effective and efficient method for delivering antagomirs in vivo. Finally, the inhibition of miRNAs in conjunction with other chemotherapy strategies could significantly improve the outcome of cancer patients.

Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors Matthew A. Tyler, Adam Quasar Sugihara, Ilya V. Ulasov, and Maciej S. Lesniak 1 Introduction Battling aggressive brain tumors represents a struggle endeavored by scientists and physicians across many different disciplines. The molecular and physio- logical abnormalities that accompany this fatal disease render malignant brain tumors arguably one of the most difficult pathologies to treat. For this reason, the efforts to combat this fatal disease are represented by a plethora of research. This chapter is organized to illustrate common themes in drug targeting for the treatment of brain tumors. Each section is organized based on the therapeutic approach: small molecules, local drug delivery, or biological therapy. In each subsection we discuss the rationale that has ushered each development to the ‘center stage’ in brain tumor therapy and provide illustrative examples using the most relevant and heretofore advanced developments. In this way, we hope to provide a discussion of brain tumor therapy that is all-encompassing yet detailed enough to give the reader a broad understanding of how researchers and clinicians attempt to improve the outcome of patients diagnosed with this debilitating disease. Conventional therapy for malignant brain tumors involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy originally directed at whole brain has become progressively focused, currently delivered in many places in the form of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Chemotherapy has relied largely on alkylating agents; however, chemotherapy for the treatment of brain tumors remains a controversial topic of debate. Despite these gains, the overall prognosis remains poor and recurrence remains the norm. Recurrence is thought to be driven by diffuse micro-infiltration of tumor cells into normal brain. Eliminating these micro-metastases remains a challenge because of the risk of damaging surrounding normal brain and the accompanying disability that may ensue. M.S.

Each subclass of malignant CNS tumors carries a different prognosis; as such, conventional chemothera- peutic treatments can include the use of synthetically derived alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, pro-drugs, and DNA synthesis/mitotic inhibitors. These types of drugs can have multiple and overlapping actions on cells with overactive metabolic pathways – i.e., quickly growing tumor cells. Many of the commonly used chemotherapy agents generated in the last 30–40 years were the result of NCI-funded research and multi-billion dollar cooperative research and deve- lopment agreements (CRADAs) between NCI and research and development companies. Below, we discuss, by drug class, some representative chemother- apeutics that are commonly used to treat brain tumors. Alkylating agents: Alkylating agents are not specific for any one pathway in particular, however, researchers have identified that some of these agents act to functionally inhibit proteins that are vital to cellular replication. Alkylation of important cellular DNA/proteins will effectively make certain cellular mole- cules/proteins inert and dysfunctional, causing disruption of metabolic path- ways and eventually cell death. It is not uncommon for a physician to prescribe multiple alkylating agents to a patient, as their cancers may develop ‘cross- resistance’ to similar classes of drugs which share overlapping mechanisms of cytotoxicity. Temozolomide and carmustine (BCNU) are the most commonly used alkylating agents for primary CNS malignancies, such as anaplastic astrocy- toma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In a recent landmark study by Stupp and colleagues, the authors elucidated that the methylation status of the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene served a prog- nostic factor in the anti-tumor efficacy of temozolomide-based therapies [1, 2]. It was shown that patients containing epigenetic silencing of the MGMT promoter, as detected by methylation-specific PCR, when treated with temo- zolomide and radiation therapy, resulted in increased median survival (21.7 months when MGMT promoter is methylated; 15.3 months when MGMT promoter is not methylated) when compared to patients receiving only radia- tion therapy without concomitant temozolomide [1, 2]. The studies conducted by Stupp resulted in the FDA’s approval of temozolomide for the treatment of high-grade glioma. Continued studies are investigating the potential of temo- zolomide in combination with other chemotherapies. Anti-metabolites: Anti-metabolites are drugs that ‘gunk up’ metabolic path- ways such as cellular respiration and nucleotide metabolism. Commonly, anti- metabolites are chemical analogues of endogenous metabolites and they act to oppose metabolic processes; in doing so, they cause irreparable damage and eventually cell death. Methotrexate is a water-soluble drug commonly used by oncologists to treat primary CNS lymphoma. Methotrexate inhibits folic acid 476 M.A. Tyler et al. synthesis by reversibly binding dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that cata- lyzes the formation of tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. Folic acid is a crucial molecule involved in nucleotide and protein synthesis and inhibiting its formation results in cell death. DNA synthesis/mitotic inhibitors: Irinotecan: Irinotecan is a drug that has been studied more recently within the context of malignant CNS tumors, especially in concert with bevicizumab (discussed below). Irinotecan is a semi- synthetic derivative of camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Irinotecan binds and stabilizes topoisomerase-DNA complexes, preventing the unwinding of DNA, thereby causing irreparable DNA double-strand breaks and even- tually cell death. Conventional chemotherapies have shown some efficacy in brain tumors because it is likely they target multiple pathways in cells exhibiting high meta- bolic rates and high mitotic indices. However, the exact mechanism of action of these agents is still largely unknown, as is the reason why certain agents work in certain types of tumors and not others. Because of this lack of information, researchers continue to unravel how these compounds exert their toxic effects in tumor cells and in specific types of cancers. With regard to CNS malignancies, oligodendrogliomas have offered hope in identifying subclasses of tumors (and patients) that respond favorably to certain chemotherapies. For instance, the 1p19q loss of function mutation in these tumors is predictive of a patient’s response to chemotherapy [3, 4]. Discoveries such as these offer the hope to develop novel chemotherapies that are specific to different molecular patho- geneses of brain tumors. 2.1 Targeting Growth Factor Signaling Axes in Brain Tumors Just like studies unraveling the details involved in mitosis yielded a generation of chemotherapies that were to target mitotic pathways, so has recent under- standing of the biochemistry of signal transduction cascades allowed scientific researchers to develop a new generation of chemotherapies that target signaling cascades in cancer. We have come to understand the processes of cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis as a cascade of signals which are transmitted from the cell surface to the nucleus and this has allowed researchers to identify some of the crucial regulators involved in cell growth and tissue regeneration. Many researchers and clinicians believe that identifying molecular abnormalities of brain tumors on a patient-to-patient basis will allow a physician to prescribe a chemotherapy regimen that will have the best benefit for the individual patient. The bulk of the novel chemotherapies have now become known as the small- molecule inhibitors (of growth factor cascades). Many of these agents are inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), a group of cell membrane- spanning receptors that contain intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. The intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of multiple RTK receptor subtypes Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 477 represent a major integration point of signaling cascades involved in cell growth, differentiation, and increased metabolic activity. Catalytically active RTKs are ’docking stations’ upon which many intracellular effectors (i.e., Ras, Raf, PI3K) converge to transmit signals received at the cell surface into an amplified intracellular response, and many times, a whole tissue response. Much of the aggressive cancerous growth of malignant brain tumors has been associated with overactive RTK-associated signal transduction pathways. Inhibiting these pathways will likely halt cellular growth and tissue regenera- tion. In this section, we discuss three principle targets of novel therapies within the context of brain tumor treatments: cell proliferation and the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR; angiogenesis and the vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGFR; and the intracellular effectors where both of these pathways can converge. Because there are new studies involved with similar agents surfacing every day, we limit our discussion to some of the most studied agents tested in brain tumors. 2.1.1 Targeting Cell Proliferation: EGFR Axis The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an RTK, a member of the Her/Erb family of proteins (EGFR is also known as Erb1 or Her1 [5]). EGFR is amplified in 40–60% of glioblastomas and approximately 30–50% of these tumors also possess the EGFRvIII mutation in which coding regions in the extracellular ligand domain (exons 2–7) are absent [6, 7]. EGFR plays an integral role in the malignant phenotype of malignant brain tumors and it is a common hope amongst researchers and clinicians that functional inhibition of EGFR-mediated signaling will slow tumor growth [8]. A randomized phase II trial compared the efficacy of temozolomide or BCNU versus the small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erlotinib, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme [9] (GBM). The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS-6) was 12% for erlotinib and 24% for temozo- lomide or BCNU. Further, the response to erlotinib could not be correlated to EGFR expression, amplification, or EGFRvIII mutation. Nonetheless, responses were noted and continued studies with EGFR RTK inhibitors in malignant glioma seek to define a correlation between patient response and EGFR-associated molecular aberrations. A molecular analysis was performed in tissue sets compiled from a multicenter phase I/II trial performed through the North American Brain Tumor Consortium (NATBC) [10]. The authors showed that erlotinib/gefitinib does not effect EGFR signaling (phosphorylation) in vivo and there was no correlation between deletion/amplification of EGFR and sensitivity to these EGFR inhibitors, yet, the authors hint at an association between decreased Akt/PI3K activity (phosphorylation) and response to erlo- tinib and gefitinib in two patients. Of note, there were no tissue sets which demonstrated the EGFRvIII mutation. Another study conducted by Mellinghoff et al. performed a molecular analysis in tissue sets from patients receiving gefitinib or erlotinib treatments for glioblastoma [11]. Their investigation 478 M.A. Tyler et al. supported previous reports which failed to find a correlation between EGFR amplification and polysomy and a response to EGFR inhibitors (p < 0.001). However, in this study, the authors were able to draw a strong correlation between EGFRvIII, PTEN and tumor sensitivity to EGFR kinase inhibitors. The authors found that 50% (6/12) of tumors expressing EGFRvIII were responsive to EGFR kinase inhibitors while only 1 of 14 non-responding patients expressed EGFRvIII (p ¼ 0.03). The authors also observed that 7 of 13 respond- ing patients were PTEN-positive while no non-responding patients were missing the PTEN locus (p ¼ 0.005). The greatest predictor of response to EGFR kinase inhibitors in this tissue set was coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN (p<0.001). These findings indicate a molecular basis for patients’ response to such therapies and will most likely have an impact on whether or not EGFR kinase inhibitors are for patient-specific treatment. 2.1.2 Targeting Angiogenesis: VEGFR Axis Vascular proliferation and neoangiogenesis are trademarks of aggressive brain tumors. The extent of neovascularization in primary brain tumors, such as malignant glioma, has often been associated with a poor patient prognosis. Angiogenesis in both healthy and diseased tissue involves complex signaling cascades involving molecules such as VEGF-A, VEGFRs1-3, PDGF, and a/ bFGF, to name a few among many [12]. One of the more thoroughly investi- gated signaling pathways are the ones that associate with VEGF and its recep- tors VEGFRs1-3. VEGF is over-secreted in malignant glial tumors and regu- lates paracrine and autocrine loops along with endothelial cells, resulting in vascular recruitment, vascular permeability, cell proliferation, tumor cell inva- sion and migration. Researchers have developed small-molecule inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab, discussed below) to target impor- tant mediators involved in the so-called, ‘angiogenic switch’ signaling that is often associated with VEGF and related molecules [13, 14]. There are ongoing trials which seek to identify the potential of small-mole- cule inhibitors, including RTK inhibitors, such as Vandetanib (Zactima, ZD6474; AstraZeneca). Vandetanib is currently being evaluated as a dual VEGFR and EGFR inhibitor. While a report on efficacy remains to be pub- lished, participating institutions in a phaseI/II trial conducted by the NIH Neuro-Oncology branch report that this drug is well tolerated and its admin- istration has produced significant radiographic responses in patients diagnosed with high-grade recurrent gliomas [15]. 2.1.3 Intracellular Effectors in Growth Cascades The loss of function deletion/mutation in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor-suppressor locus is found to occur in 30–40% of GBM patients [16, 17]. PTEN is a regulator of the pro-growth kinases, PI3K and AKT. Phosphorylation of these proteins can activate pro-growth/pro-survival Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 479 pathways while dephosphorylation by PTEN phosphatase activity negatively regulates the kinase activity mediated by PI3K and AKT. mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) is a downstream target of PI3K and AKT activity and also a crucial integrative regulatory kinase involved with the following meta- bolic transduction proteins: T-cell proliferation through interaction with immu- nophilin FKBP-12, p70s6 kinase activity, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-bind- ing protein 1 [18– 25]. All of these regulatory proteins integrate key cell growth and survival signals important in normal cell and tumor cell growth. Functional inhibition of pathways involving these molecules has been achieved using the small-molecule inhibitors, Sirolimus (rapamycin) and its ester analog, temsir- olimus (CCI-779), which have been shown to inhibit mTOR-regulated path- ways. Pre-clinical models have demonstrated a sensitivity of PTEN-deficient tumors to mTOR inhibition using these agents [26, 27]. A recent phase II study conducted by Gulanis et al. tested the efficacy of Temsirolimus (CCI-779) in 65 patients with recurrent GBM [22]. Twenty patients showed radiographic responses, as determined by a decreased T2-weighted MRI signal. However, the progression-free survival was only 7.8% at 6 months for patients receiving Temsirolimus treatment and no objective response was observed. The authors noted a correlation between radiographic response and p70s6 kinase phosphorylation in baseline tumor samples, although, there was no association with radiographic response and EGFR amplification/expression, PTEN deletion/expression, or AKT phosphorylation. 3 Barriers in the CNS and Novel Approaches in Delivering Drugs to Brain Tumors The blood–brain barrier refers to a physiological state in which the brain is protected from an array of potentially dangerous insults that circulate in the blood. The protective physiological landscape that describes the blood–brain barrier is represented by both physical and molecular properties, the combina- tion of which provides very selective uptake and filtering of key agents impor- tant for optimal brain function. There are two barrier systems in the normal adult brain: the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). The BBB is composed of three cell types, all of which play an important role in BBB integrity and regulation: endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature, astrocytes, and pericytes (Fig. 1). Pericytes of BBB localize to the capillary basement membrane, sandwiched next to endothelial vessel cells by astrocytic end feet, which form very extensive and intimate bundles around both pericytes and endothelial vessel cells (Fig. 1). Specific characteristics of the BBB are believed to be maintained and induced by the astrocytic processes [28– 30]. The endothe- lial cells of the cerebral vasculature differ from their counterparts in peripheral systems in that they lack fenestrations [31– 33], demonstrate little to no 480 M.A. Tyler et al. pinocytic activity [34– 36], possess a high content of tight junctions (TJ) [37, 38], and maintain a characteristically elevated metabolic activity [34, 35]. The anatomical characteristics of the BBB and their molecular ‘building blocks’ function to prevent paracellular and transcellular transport of blood-borne substances, including cells and hydrophilic substances, both large and small (>180 Da). Thus, transport through the BBB is limited to miniscule, lipophilic entities and substances that are transported using molecular transport mechan- isms. The molecular transport systems in the CNS are highly coordinated to regulate the influx and efflux of important molecules from brain parenchyma, thereby maintaining CNS homeostasis. These transport systems include organic anion and organic cation transporters (OATs and OCTs), ATP-dependent transporters (i.e., p-glycoprotein), nucleoside transporters, amino acid transpor- ters, and receptor-mediated transporters [39– 46]. The most cited transport system of the BBB is represented by members of the multidrug-resistance protein family (MDR), the most popular being p-glycoprotein. The BCSFB constitutes an additional compartment in the CNS which drugs must traverse. The BCSFB is comprised of the choroid plexus and arachnoid membranes which consist of choroid and arachnoid epithelium, respectively, as their major cell constituents. These structures interface with nearly all major Fig. 1 Anatomical makeup of the blood–brain barrier. Endothelial cells of the cerebral capillaries are tightly joined by complexes of tight junctions. Pericytes are found surrounding the capillary endothelium and are continuous with the basement membrane of the endothelium. The astro- cytic endfeet are wrapped tightly around both pericytes and endothelial cells. Together, these cells work together to tightly regulate the influx/efflux and metabolism of molecules important for optimal brain function. Figure was reprinted, with permission [243] Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 481 brain structures in the CNS, particularly the ventricular cavities and outer cerebral cortex structures [47]. The major role of the epithelial cells of the BCSFB is to secrete cerebrospinal fluid, a cocktail of micronutrients, electro- lytes, neuropeptides, and proteins which immerse major CNS structures and related capillary endothelium. The epithelial cells of the choroid plexus repre- sent major regulators of homeostasis and bulk flow in the CNS (Fig. 2).

Nearly all major brain structures interface with the CSF system. This coronal section of the posterior CNS captures all the ventricles: lateral, third, and fourth. CSF originates from the choroid plexuses of the lateral and third ventricles and percolates downward through the narrow cerebral aqueduct (Aq). The bottom of the Aq empties into the fourth ventricle, to the roof of which is attached more choroidal tissue. CSF flows out of the fourth ventricle though foramina into the cisterna magna and other nearby large basal cisterns. From the cisterns, the CSF is convicted posteriorly downward around the spinal cord (subarachnoid space) as well as upward over the convexities of the cerebral hemispheres. At more distal sites in the subarachnoid system, the CSF flows outward though the arachnoid villi into venous blood of the superior sagittal sinus. Arrows depict the general patterns of CSF flow from the interior of the brain to various exterior loci in the spinal cord and hemispheres. SCO, subcommissural organ. Some CSF drains directly into lymphatic glands. 1 – Caudate; 3 – centrum ovale (white matter); 3 – thalamus; 4 – hippocampus; 5 – periaqueductal gray; 6 – cerebellum; 7 – cerebral motor cortex. Figure and corresponding text were reprinted, with permission [47] 482 M.A. Tyler et al. such, the BCSFB has been known to be a drug sink, in that it can draw drugs out of the CNS interstitium, into the CSF, and into venous circulation [47, 48]. The BBB and BCSFB signify major hurdles in drug delivery to the CNS, and especially to brain tumors. Malignant brain tumors have been known to pro- liferate around cerebral vasculature with intact BBB in addition to demonstrat- ing neovascularization, which are less predictable in nature than intact BBB and CSF-structures. Together, the barrier pathophysiology which describes blood flow in CNS malignancies has been referred to as the blood–brain tumor barrier (BBTB). Malignant CNS tumors demonstrate tortuous vascular pathologies, along with enhanced drug efflux capabilities. Given this pathological land- scape, the interstitial pressures in different areas of the tumor can vary greatly, making it extremely difficult for a drug to reach high intratumoral concentra- tions. To overcome these obstacles in delivering drugs to the brain, researchers have devised novel invasive and non-invasive mechanisms in an attempt to achieve high drug concentrations within the brain and the brain tumor for sustained periods of time. Whether a drug is delivered systemically or locally, the rationale for each approach is the same: maintenance of high concentrations of the cytotoxic compound within the brain tumor/CNS. 3.1 Inhibiting Drug Transporters Recent discoveries involving the molecular underpinnings of chemotherapy efflux in the brain have drawn researcher’s attention toward manipulating these trans- port systems to achieve high concentrations of an anti-tumor agent within the brain. In particular, the p-glycoprotein transporters of the multidrug-resistant protein family are documented as playing a central role in the efflux of xenobiotic agents away from the CNS. P-glycoprotein is not a discriminatory transport protein; this is substantiated with studies showing that many current chemother- apy compounds are substrates for p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux [49]. Clinical researchers have hypothesized that inhibiting the transport function of p-glyco- protein in the BBB may expose brain tumors to elevated levels of anti-tumor agents for sustained periods of time [43]. Results from clinical trials were at first promis- ing, but advanced studies revealed disappointing results [50]. The major limitation of this approach is obvious: while p-glycoprotein expression may be higher intra- tumorally and in CNS barrier structures, it is not unique to these organs. Inhibition of p-glycoprotein leads to systemic toxicities in the liver, kidney, and pancreas, all of which express p-glycoprotein as a functional transport protein. 3.2 Invasive Drug Delivery to Brain Tumors Because the CNS barriers limit the amount of cytotoxic agent that can access the brain, invasive drug delivery methods have been developed to bypass CNS Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 483 barriers. Invasive drug delivery to brain tumors can describe a variety of methods, depending on the type of brain tumor and its exact location within the CNS. Typically, invasive methods for drug delivery can include intratu- moral/intracavitary delivery, intra-arterial delivery, and delivery using CSF compartments. 3.2.1 CSF Delivery Delivery of chemotherapies and other drugs using the cerebrospinal compart- ments represents a way to achieve sustained concentrations of drug in the brain (Reviewed in [47]). Unlike capillary endothelium of the BBB, endothelial vessels of choroid plexus villi demonstrate multiple sites of fenestration. In addition, choroid epithelia are less restrictive in their paracellular transport capacity, as demonstrated by their ability to allow paracellular transport of intravascular administrations of mannitol (Mw ¼ 182), inulin polysaccharide (Mw \u0002 5000), and other hydrophilic substances [51– 54]. Indeed, CSF is the preferred route for the delivery of hydrophilic anti-cancer agents, such as methotrexate [49]. Because CSF interfaces most of the brain’s superficial structures, CSF-drug delivery has shown efficacy for tumors localized to leptomeningeal structures, ependymal structures, and the periventricular compartments. The Ommaya reservoir was developed to harness these features of CSF-mediated delivery. With an Ommaya reservoir, an implantable pump is placed into CSF-structures – such as the ventricular compartments and subarachnoid spaces – and drugs are delivered over a sustained period of time. This technique has been used to deliver chemotherapies such as methotrexate and BCNU, and biological agents such as IL-2 and IFN-g [55– 59]. The CSF route for drug delivery may also represent a feasible delivery platform using cell-based and recombinant protein- based anti-tumor therapies [47]. The major limitations involved in utilizing CSF compartments for drug delivery include bulk flow of CSF compartments, laborious and potentially dangerous procedures, and diffusion limitations. Bulk flow in CSF is difficult to monitor and the influx/efflux patterns between CSF compartments, ependyma, capillary endothelium, and brain parenchyma is difficult to anticipate, especially in heterogeneous CNS malignancies. Infec- tion and morbidity are always potential complications associated with this type of drug administration. Lastly, the amount of brain surface area exposed to CSF compartment is considerably less than BBB structures and in many cases diffusion of a particular drug to brain parenchyma can drop with the square of the diffusion distance [60]. This is a significant hurdle in using this route to deliver drugs to CNS tumors that reside beyond superficial areas of the brain. 3.2.2 Blood–Brain Barrier Disruption and Intra-Arterial Delivery Intra-arterial drug (IA) delivery to brain tumors involves the use of cerebral arteries for the local delivery of anti-tumor agents. With IA drug delivery, a catheter is placed in an artery in close proximity to the lesion(s) (left or right 484 M.A. Tyler et al. carotid artery versus left or right vertebral artery). After the catheter has been placed in a predetermined artery, a drug is infused into the artery for a sustained period of time. IA drug delivery for the treatment of malignant brain tumors has experienced a re-awakening with advent of blood–brain barrier disruption (BBBD) agents, such as the hyperosmotic agent, mannitol, and the bradykinin analog, RMP-7. The use of these agents effectively shrinks cerebral capillary endothelium and creates a transient opening of the BBB (15 minutes–2 hours) [61, 62], allowing transcellular passage of chemotherapy agents that would normally not have access to brain parenchyma without BBBD. While the use of this technique for the delivery of drugs is somewhat controversial given its laborious procedure, there exists an international consortium devoted to IA and BBBD drug delivery (the International BBBD Consortium) paradigms in treating CNS tumors. Researchers from this consortium have found that this method of drug delivery is both feasible and promising. While a phase III randomized trial has yet to be conducted, this is mostly because of a need for multi-disciplinary expertise to carry out such a study. Thus, patient stratifica- tion and powerful analysis has been limited in past studies. However, studies conducted in patients with primary CNS lymphoma, metastatic lesions, and malignant glioma have demonstrated the potential promise of IA and BBBD drug delivery approaches [49, 63– 66]. 3.2.3 Intratumoral and Intracavitary Delivery For many current experimental forms of brain tumor therapy, delivering drugs directly into the tumor mass or the tumor resection cavity represents a very common and promising method for drug delivery. Intracavitary delivery of drugs to brain tumors allows the neurosurgeon to visually map out the desired target and deliver an agent. This method of delivery has the ability to circum- vent CNS barrier structures and is indeed the method of choice for delivering experimental therapeutics, such as vector therapies (discussed below) and other novel therapies. Below, we discuss some of the most commonly referenced investigations which employed intracavitary drug delivery approaches, namely, intracavitary depositing of polymer-laden drugs and convection-enhanced delivery (CED). From this point on, we will refer to intratumoral/intracavitary drug delivery as ‘local delivery’, for simplicity. Polymer-Laden Drug Delivery Many drugs that have showed promise for the treatment of the most aggressive brain tumors are not feasible for delivery by the IV or oral route because systemic toxicities are a significant problem. This was the case for carmustine (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea; BCNU). Carmustine is an alkylating agent that was approved in 1977 to treat malignant gliomas because it was proven to be one of the first effective therapies in treating this most aggressive subclass of malignant brain tumors [67– 69]. However, the IV use of BCNU was Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 485 hampered because of systemic toxicities, including severe myelosuppression, pulmonary fibrosis, and secondary acute leukemia [70– 74]. Given these disappointing findings, Dr. Henry Brem at Johns Hopkins and Dr. Robert Langer at MIT developed the idea of embedding BCNU in a polymer matrix to achieve sustained drug delivery to malignant glioma [75]. The final BCNU–polymer matrix used in clinical trials was composed of a poly(carboxyphenoxy-propane/sebacic acid) matrix loaded with carmustine, also known as Gliadel 1. Phase III clinical trials used a 3.5% BCNU loading per 200 mg of polymer matrix and wafers were placed in regions lining the resection cavity (Fig. 3). This method of drug delivery allows for an in vivo release period of 21 days, with much of the drug release taking place over the first 5–7 days after implantation and complete degradation was noted at 6–8 weeks after implantation [76– 80]. Most importantly, this method of drug delivery demonstrates little to no systemic toxicities. A meta-analysis reported the results from two phase III trials which tested the effect of BCNU wafers and radiation versus placebo wafers and radiation in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma [81– 83]. This meta-analysis found a 13.1 month median survival in patients receiving Gliadel 1 and a 10.9 month median survival in patients receiving placebo wafers (p ¼ 0.031). The results from this meta-ana- lysis led to the FDA approval of Gliadel for newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients in 2003. While these findings may seem somewhat modest, they have provided a framework for developing polymer-laden drugs for local delivery to brain tumors. Polymer-based drug delivery represents a method to achieve sustained drug activity in the brain and new developments in local delivery to brain tumors continue to investigate the use of such delivery platforms using other drugs. Similar to carmustine, other agents such as methotrexate, which demonstrate considerable anti-tumor toxicity but limited clinical application in gliomas because of poor penetrability of brain parenchyma, are being investi- gated for their potential to be delivered using polymer platforms. Fig. 3 Polymer-laden drug delivery. Following resection of a malignant glioma, up to eight carmustine (BCNU)- polymer wafers are placed within the tumor cavity. As the wafers dissolve, they release BCNU locally and provide direct delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor cavity. Figure and text were reprinted, with permission [57] 486 M.A. Tyler et al. Convection-Enhanced Delivery When delivered locally within the brain, the concentration of a drug traveling by diffusion drops exponentially from the site of administration. This becomes more of a burden with micrometastases and infiltrative satellites that are commonly seen in the most aggressive type of brain tumor, malignant glioma, where it is difficult for a drug to reach intraparenchymal regions of the brain beyond the resection cavity and especially in ‘eloquent’ areas of the brain. With this in mind, researchers at NIH developed convection-enhanced delivery (CED) as a novel way to deliver drugs over a large volume of tissue. With CED, a catheter(s) is placed in a predetermined area of the brain using standard imaging techniques (i.e., postoperative MRI scans and computed tomography scans) and a drug is infused over a period of hours to days. A constant pressure gradient created by an infusion pump permits the drug infusate to be delivered homogenously to circumscribed areas of brain tissue without causing signifi- cant tissue damage. This method of delivery has especially become relevant in drug delivery to brain tumors because it bypasses the BBB and reduces systemic toxicities. Moreover, it allows for the local delivery of macromolecules, such as viruses, liposomes, targeted antibodies and protein moieties to large areas of brain parenchyma. One of the first clinical trials to evaluate the application of convection- enhanced delivery in brain tumors involved studies with cintredekin besudotox (CB), a recombinant protein toxin consisting of the IL-13 ligand conjugated to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin. CB targets the IL13 receptor a2 commonly over-expressed in malignant glioma. This recombinant cytotoxin demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, with 50% inhibi- tory concentrations of 0.1–30 ng/ml [84– 86]. The first clinical studies assessing the CED-mediated delivery of CB were in patients with recurrent malignant glioma [87]. These studies established the dose-limiting toxicity (0.5 mg/ml), infusion dose (6 days of infusion well tolerated) as well as the importance of catheter placement in outcome efficacy. A follow-up study was conducted with CB in patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. Twenty-two patients undergoing gross total resection of their mass received 96-hour infusions of CB (0.25 or 0.5 mg/ml), followed by external beam radiation and temozolomide or no temozolomide treatment [88]. The majority of treatment-related adverse events recorded were either grade 1 or 2, which related to catheter placement and CB. Unfortunately, a recent phase III study comparing the efficacy of IL13- Pseudomonas exotoxin therapy versus Gliadel wafers failed to show any benefit over Gliadel alone. In a recent phase I trial conducted by Sampson et al., the authors utilized CED to infuse an EGFR-targeted toxin, TP-38, to patients diagnosed with recurrent malignant brain tumors [89]. TP-38 is a recombinant protein consist- ing of a genetic fusion of TGF-a and a modified form of Pseudomonas exotoxin. In this study, the authors infused TP-38 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/h/catheter over a period of 50 hours, for a total volume of 40 ml. The study investigated the Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 487 toxicity and response of three doses: 25 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, and 100 ng/ml. There were little dose-limiting toxicities associated with the study, and no systemic toxicities were reported. The overall median time to progression was 14.9 weeks. Of note, 2 of 15 patients with residual tumor at the time of therapy demonstrated radiographic response and were alive at the time of report. One patient diagnosed with multirecurrent bifrontal GBM treated at the 25-ng/ml level had a nearly complete response that persisted for 198 weeks without progression. Another patient diagnosed with GBM showed nearly complete response and remained (alive for >260 weeks). What was interesting about this phase I study was that the authors con- ducted SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography) imaging to monitor the distribution of drug infusate (Fig. 4). Usually, the infusate is Fig. 4 CED of the targeted toxin, TP-38.(A) Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image of TP-38 distribution co-registered with axial MR image for anterior catheter positioned below the resection cavity.

Figure and text were reprinted, with permission [89] 488 M.A. Tyler et al. co-administered with albumin, which serves as a carrier protein for the infused drug. In its place, the authors used 123I-labeled albumin coinfused in the same volume with TP-38, and subsequently, they were allowed to observe the drug distribution properties mediated by CED. This method allows for a better interpretation of the clinical efficacy of TP-38. Their results and those from other groups revealed one of the major obstacles encountered in CED – the need to optimize drug delivery parameters using CED. Many times, the area in which a catheter is placed (i.e., white matter versus gray matter) can effect the distribution of a particular drug. The drug may enter areas of lower resistance (i.e., ventricular compartments, CSF) rather than the intended target. Such findings illustrate a requisite need to employ state-of-the art imaging systems to track drug distribution. These findings also underscore the need to better understand the parameters in the diseased brain which dictate the distribution of a particular drug [90]. 4 Targeted Biological Therapy for Brain Tumors 4.1 Antibody-Based Drugs and Recombinant Proteins: Active Targeting of Brain Tumors Scientific researchers are consumed with the idea of identifying the ‘magic bullet,’ as Paul Ehrlich once hypothesized, which will one day successfully treat the most devastating cancers; malignant brain tumors are no exception. The development of monoclonal antibodies against cancer targets symbolizes a principle manifestation of Ehrlich’s concept. The rationale for developing anti- body-based mechanisms to target brain tumors is obvious. With the advent of hybridoma technology, antibodies can be generated against any conceivable target on the tumor cell surface or the tumor interstitium (i.e., secreted ligands). This is especially relevant in the case of cancer, where the restricted expression of so-called ‘tumor-associated antigens’ (TAA) can readily be identified using modern biotechnological screenings. Monoclonal antibodies are engineered to elicit their anti-tumor responses in three putative fashions: (i) conveying toxins in the form of chemical conjugation to the antibody, aka immunoconjugates, immunotoxins; (ii) inhibiting activation of pivotal signal transduction proteins involved in cell growth and tissue regen- eration; and (iii) activation of the immune system [91– 93]. Currently, antibodies have been engineered according to three basic classifications, namely, chimeric (mouse + human), human (entirely human), and humanized (mouse comple- mentary determining region (CDR) + human). The most well-known examples of antibody-based drug delivery in brain tumors refer to studies with the mAb, bevacizumab (Avastin 1). Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG1 mAb engineered to bind secreted VEGF protein, preventing its interaction with cognate receptors and the downstream signals that eventually result in tumor angiogenesis. Bev- acizumab has been approved to treat patients diagnosed with metastatic Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 489 colorectal cancer, and since then, it has been evaluated in the treatment of patients with malignant glial tumors. Trials investigating the potential utility of bevacizumab in combination with the topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan, have yielded astonishing results. In a trial conducted by Vredenburgh et al. at Duke University, patients with recurrent GBM were treated with 10 mg/kg bevacizu- mab plus irinotecan every 2 weeks [94]. Twenty out of the 35 patients treated had at least a partial response, using a greater than 50% decrease in contrast- enhanced MRI signal as a criterion for partial response. The overall 6-month PFS was 46% (95% CI, 32–66%) and the 6-month overall survival was 77% (95% CI, 64–92%). These results are extremely promising, given the poor prog- nosis of patients diagnosed with recurrent GBM. It has been speculated that antagonizing VEGF activity helps to reduce the tortuous vasculature associated with GBM pathogenesis by reducing vascular permeability and interstitial pressures within the tumor mass, making it easier for drugs like irinotecan to penetrate the tumor bulk [94, 95]. These speculations pose another intriguing question: Are the radiographic responses reported due to the reduced vascular permeability, or a result of a bevacizumab-mediated anti-tumor response? Ques- tions like these underscore a need for new radiographic criteria to be developed to better assess the anti-tumor effect of novel agents. There are currently 22 active and approved clinical trials (mostly phase II) that are assessing the activity of bevacizumab against malignant CNS tumors. The results from these studies are awaited with interest. In addition to the uses described above, antibodies and recombinant proteins/ peptides have been engineered to target membrane proteins of the BBB and tumor surface to achieve delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor parenchyma [41, 96]. This approach was developed based on our current knowledge of receptor- mediated transcytosis (RMT) mechanisms in BBB endothelial cells. The BBB contains multiple receptor types that utilize RMT to ferry metabolites from the BBB luminal surface, through the cell cytoplasm to the abluminal surface and brain interstitium. With this in mind, monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins have been engineered to target receptors of the BBB, such as LDL receptors, the transferrin receptor (TfR), and IGF receptor [39, 85]. More recently, these antibody systems and recombinant proteins have been engineered and used to ‘decorate’ polymeric nanoparticles such as PEG, liposomes, and others in an attempt to actively target the brain parenchyma through the vascular delivery route. For instance, Hallahan et al. showed that a fibrinogen ligand could be conjugated to liposomes and albumin nanoparticles and could effec- tively target radiation-induced integrin expression in tumor vasculature when delivered intravenously [97]. Polymeric ‘bioconjugates’, or nanoparticles, con- sisting of a polymer, encapsulated drug, and recombinant protein targeting moiety represent a novel and active area of research. Formulations have been innovated using chemotherapies such as methotrexate, cisplatin, paclitaxel with targeting moieties against EGFR and TfR. Although, these studies are still in their infancy and relevant pre-clinical studies have yet to become prevalent. The antibody/protein density that is used to decorate polymeric nanoparticles is a 490 M.A. Tyler et al. critical factor in affecting good delivery and stability of the devised nanocarrier and a researcher must engineer the protein so as not to compete with endogenous ligand. These systems represent a somewhat novel yet exciting delivery approach for brain tumor therapy and it is likely that these systems will enter ‘center stage’ in the near future. 4.2 Vector Therapy Vector therapies for the treatment of brain tumors represent a significant research interest in the realm of experimental brain tumor therapies. Because the brain represents an area of ‘immune privilege’ (discussed below), the local delivery of allogenic agents directly into the tumor cavity is both a feasible and a logical approach to achieve selective anti-tumor therapy. Vector therapy refers to a type of gene therapy in which nucleic acid, whether it is DNA or RNA, is targeted to a specific cell type, cancer cells in our case. Upon vector delivery, the gene of interest is expressed (or, knocked down in the case of siRNA/miRNA) and tumor cell cytotoxicity is concomitant with gene delivery. Similar to anti- body development strategies, the potential targets are left to the researcher’s imagination; however, the range of cancer targets is more extensive with vector therapy than with antibody-based therapy. With vector therapies, the cancer target is not limited to cell surface or interstitial expression. For this reason, vector therapies all differ in their particular genetic construction and choice of cancer target, but can still be classified based on the method of delivery: (i) viral vector delivery and (ii) non-viral vector delivery. Up until now, the gene of interest has included oncolytic viral genes (aka, virotherapy), suicide genes (e.g., v-tk), cytokine gene transfer, and tumor-suppressor gene transfer [98, 99]. In any case, the goal of any gene therapy approach is as such: targeted gene expression throughout the tumor tissue. 4.2.1 Non-Viral Vector Delivery Non-viral vector delivery has been characterized largely by the use of cell-based and liposomal-based gene delivery systems. In the earliest malignant brain tumor clinical trials which assessed the efficacy of cell-based gene delivery systems, researchers employed a murine fibroblast cell line to transduce tumor cells with the HSV thymidine kinase gene (HSV-tk) [100]. In a phase III study conducted by the GL1328 international study group, patients with previously untreated GBM received 30–50 single intracavitary injections of vector producing cells (VPC) in a mean volume of 9.1 ml (range 4.0–12.6 ml at 1\u0003108 VPC/ml), after which, the thymidine kinase inhibitor, ganciclovir (GCV) was administered IV (5 mg/kg over 1 hour period) 2 weeks after VPC injection for a period of 2 weeks. The median time to progression for the gene therapy treatment arm was 180 days, while the control groups, which received Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 491 standard fractionated radiotherapy was 183 days. The median survival was 365 days and 354 days, and the 12-month survival rates were 50 and 55% for the gene therapy and control groups, respectively. While this treatment proved safe and feasible, there clearly was no benefit when compared to standard therapy. Researchers believe that the lack of success was most likely due to limited gene delivery resulting from the non-motile murine fibroblast and the MLV vector. Since then, researchers have entered into an age where the use of bone marrow- derived progenitor cells and neural stem cells has become the cell of choice for targeted gene delivery to brain tumors. These cells demonstrate a characteristic tropism for CNS pathology, regardless of whether the tumor originated within the CNS or metastasized from another organ system [101]. Stem cells are commonly engineered using retroviral-based expression cassettes, in which, a retroviral vector is used to insert a specific gene of interest into the tumor-tropic stem cell. Theoretically, the genetically engineered cell should express the gene of interest once inserted. Upon expression of inserted gene into the tumor region, tumor cell toxicity results. More commonly, lentiviral-based retroviral vectors have become the favorite vector for stem cell engineering, because these viruses have a higher rate of gene insertion into the host genome, most likely because lentiviral insertion is not dependent on the stage of the host’s cell cycle, unlike MLV vectors employed in first generation trials. Aboody and colleagues have conducted extensive studies showing the suitability of neural stem cells (NSC) in delivering suicide genes, such as cytosine deaminase, in effecting tumor reduction [102– 106]. These researchers have documented their observa- tions to the extent that the development of a NSC-based clinical trial is cur- rently under development. In addition to the pioneering studies such as those of the Aboody group, researchers have engineered stem cells to express siRNA to ‘knock-down’ cancerous gene expression, immunogenic cytokines, etc. Other cell-based strategies that fall within the category of ‘immunotherapy’ are rele- vant under a gene therapy context. These strategies, however, are discussed in more detail below, under immunotherapy approaches. The half-life of nucleic acid, when delivered in its ‘naked’ form, is very low. Liposomal-mediated delivery of genes represents a way of shuttling genes to tumor tissues in the brain and protecting them from host nucleases. In addi- tion, liposomes are relatively easy to manufacture and they possess no inher- ent toxic or immunogenic characteristics at the doses used. In a recent study, cationic liposomes were employed to deliver the suicide gene, HSV-tk,to patients afflicted with GBM [107]. In this study, researchers used PET ima- ging and CED to deliver the HSV-tk suicide gene. While the study included only eight patients, one of the patients demonstrated sites of necrosis correlat- ing to GCV activity by PET [107]. The use of liposomes has been argued to be non-specific in activity, however, novel studies have shown that liposomes can be functionalized with specific peptides/antibodies which can mediate specific gene delivery based on the expression of characteristic tumor cell surface proteins [108, 109]. 492 M.A. Tyler et al. 4.2.2 Viral Vector Delivery Viruses have evolved to achieve robust gene expression within a host’s cell. For this reason, viral gene delivery represents a substantial amount of current gene therapy research, and so far, the best way to deliver a gene to a desired cell type. Viral vector delivery to brain tumors has been investigated using different types of viruses, including adenovirus (Ad), herpes simplex virus (HSV), retrovirus (RV), measles virus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Semliki Forest virus, vaccinia virus, and reovirus [110]. The most commonly used viruses represented in experimental brain tumor therapies are the HSV and Ad viruses. Replication-deficient viral vectors have been used in early clinical trials for patients with recurrent GBM to deliver the HSV-tk gene, with some promise [111– 114]. After a phase I trial established that adenovirus-mediated HSV-tk therapy significantly improved survival (15.0 months) of malignant glioma patients when compared to retrovirus-mediated HSV-tk gene delivery (7.4 months; p<0.012), a randomized controlled study by Immonen et al. was undertaken in patients with primary and recurrent gliomas [111]. Patients in the active treatment group received intracavitary injections of 3\u00031010 PFUs of the ADvHSV-tk vector in aliquots of 0.1–0.3 ml for a total volume of 10 ml. The treatment was tolerated well; anti-Ad antibodies could be detected in 6 out of 17 patients receiving the active treatment without any particularly adverse effects. Most importantly, patients in the active treatment group demonstrated signifi- cantly longer mean survival time (70.6 +/– 52.9 weeks) than a historical control group (62.4 +/– 30.9 weeks; p<0.0017, log rank regression). The results from these clinical trials have led researchers to investigate the role of Ad’s ability to deliver other anti-tumor genes, such as the cytokine IFN-b. IFN-b is a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-proliferative and immunomodula- tory activities. Pre-clinical studies evaluating the anti-tumor activity of Ad- delivered IFN-b in murine models (hIFN-b) demonstrated that administration could affect complete tumor regression, CD8+ activation and long-term resis- tance to re-challenge in an intraperitoneal tumor model [115]. Chiocca et al. recently published a phase I trial which investigated safety and potential effi- cacy of Ad-delivered human IFN-b (Ad.hIFN-b) in patients with malignant glioma [116]. A total of 11 patients in the active treatment group were sub- divided into 3 treatment cohorts based on vector dose (2\u00031010,6\u00031010,2\u00031011 viral particles). Patients received two separate injections of Ad.hIFN-b; on day 1, patients received five stereotactic injections directly into the tumor mass. Four to eight days after the first injection, the tumor was removed and a total of 10 vector injections (1.0 ml total volume) were administered by free hand directly into the tumor resection cavity. Biological response to vector delivery was analyzed by measuring serum Il-6 and IL-10 concentrations, hIFN-b levels in resected tissue and CSF samples, anti-Ad antibodies, vector biodistribution, serum neopterin concentration, and histopathological analysis. Histological analysis of brain tumor tissue indicated a dose-related induction in apoptosis Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 493 which was consistent with inflammatory infiltrates with populations of neutro- phils, macrophages, and monocytes. Intratumoral Ad.hIFN-b DNA was detected in 10 out of 11 patients receiving active treatment. The authors noted a variable yet dose-related increase in anti-Ad titers (1/6 in low and intermediate groups versus 4/5 in high-dose treatment group). There was one patient who experienced grade 4 dose-limiting toxicity of confusion which was associated with treatment administration. The authors posited that this may have been due to extravasation of the vector into CSF fluids. The use of replication-deficient vectors prevents promiscuous and poten- tially hazardous viral replication; however, it also limits the extent of gene delivery. For this reason, virotherapy (virotherapy ¼ VIRal Oncolytic THER- APY) has been developed. With virotherapy, researchers hope to exploit the lytic replication cycle of a virus to achieve a sustained anti-tumor infection. Commonly, a replication-competent viral vector is engineered to specifically transduce and replicate in tumor tissue, thereby lysing tumor cells in a specific fashion. There exist a number of genetic engineering strategies in which researchers modify the virus genome so that a replicating virus specifically kills tumors cells. First generation viral vectors possessed deletion mutations which attenuated viral replication and restricted cell lysis to cells with over- active metabolisms, i.e., rapidly dividing tumor cells. Viral vectors falling under this category include ONYX-015, a human Ad type 5 vector missing the 55 kDa E1B protein; and G207, a HSV-1 vector containing deletion modifications in regions of its genome corresponding to g134.5 and UL39 coding regions [117, 118]. The initial phase I trials assessing the dose-limiting toxicities of these agents show that there is little toxicity resulting from local administration of these agents [117, 118]. A clinical study conducted by the New Approaches to Brain Tumor Therapy CNS Consortium (NABTT) with the ONYX-015 vector found that the replicating Ad was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to treatment. Further, no maximum tolerated dose was achieved (max. dose: 1010 PFUs). The median time to progression after treatment was 46 days. Three patients remained alive with more than 19 months of follow-up and one patient had not progressed at the time of report. These studies have provided a logistical framework for the use of replicating viral vectors in patients with aggressive brain tumors. Given the somewhat low toxicity profile of these agents, additional studies will need to evaluate the efficacy of these approaches. In addition to deletion modifications which render these attenuated viruses more specific, researchers have recently made use of tissue-specific promoters (TSPs) and transductional modifications to achieve efficient tumor-specific cell lysis. Continued studies with ONYX-015 and G207 showed that these viruses do not transduce the tumor tissue to an extent that would produce observable therapeutic benefits. The use of TSPs that control the expression of viral replication proteins is a useful strategy and has been documented by several groups [119– 124]. Transductional modifications also increase gene transfer to tumor cells. The incorporation of the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptide motif into 494 M.A. Tyler et al. the Ad type 5 virus has been shown to improve viral transduction to malignant glioma cells by targeting avb3 and avb5 integrins [125– 128]. Most experimental strategies investigating the potential of anti-tumor viral vectors utilize local intratumoral/intracavitary injections to deliver a viral agent. This bears several limitations, namely, gene expression is limited to areas sur- rounding the injection tract. In addition, despite the fact that patients with CNS malignancies are severely immunocomprimised, clearance of the viral agent by local immune cell populations has been documented [129, 130]. It is likely that the use of an additional agent, such as stem cells [131], polymer systems [132], and immunosuppressants [133] will increase the residence of these viral particles within the brain, permitting adequate gene amplification and tumor toxicity. Also, with the advent and promise demonstrated with CED systems, viral delivery may be significantly enhanced when administered using CED plat- forms. It is also likely that these virolytic agents will show promise when combined with other treatment modalities. Pre-clinical studies assessing the use of oncolytic viral agents in combination with chemotherapies and radio- therapies have shown promise [134– 137] and it is likely that in the future the efficacy of oncolytic agents will be assessed when combined with different therapies, such as temozolomide and radiotherapy. 4.3 Immunotherapy Multiple forms of immunotherapy are being explored both as an adjuvant and as an alternative treatment. However the effectiveness of these approaches is limited by the immune privileged status of the brain. The concept of immune privilege grew out of experiments by Peter B. Medawar showing that unlike the rest of the body, the brain did not immediately reject foreign transplanted tissue. Once thought to be a result of the immune system’s ‘ignorance’ of what transpired within the brain [138], over time the concept of immune privilege has been challenged and refined as increasing evidence suggests that the immune system is functional within the CNS, albeit in a finely regulated manner [139]. ‘Immune Privilege’ in the CNS: The immune system is thought of comprising two arms, an afferent or immune sensing arm that detects the presence of pathogens or altered self cells and primes or activates the efferent arm, tasked with killing or neutralizing the invader [140]. Both of these arms are limited or otherwise restricted within the brain in ways which limit the immune system’s ability to respond to glioma. Dendritic cells (DC) are a critical component of the afferent arm, but their function is restricted within the brain. In other organ systems of the body, DC serve as the most effective of the professional antigen presenting cells (APC), sentinels that phagocytose or otherwise absorb intruders and then travel through the lymphatic system to draining lymph nodes where they present foreign antigen to B and T cells of the efferent arm to activate the immune Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 495 response. The CNS lacks a conventional lymphatic system and DC are not present in non-inflamed brain parenchyma [141]. Furthermore, in experiments in which DC were injected into parenchyma, they did not home to draining lymph nodes, supporting the theory that DC do not patrol the parenchyma where glioma develop [142]. Instead, afferent sensing within the parenchyma works through drainage of soluble antigen along perivascular spaces of capil- laries and arteries into lymph nodes [143]. Although there are no DC in normal parenchyma, DC are present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; CSF-DC) and do home to lymph nodes when stimulated there. However, both CSF-DC and soluble antigen draining appear to skew the efferent arm away from generating a Th-1 Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response thought to be most effective against tumor toward a Th-2 humoral response more suited to targeting a bacterial infection. The efferent arm, once thought to be largely intact in the CNS, has proven to be highly regulated as well. Entry of potential effector cells, T cells, B cells, and monocytes, is tightly controlled by the blood–brain barrier physiology in a two- step process, each one requiring different activation steps. First, cells must pass through the vascular endothelium of the post capillary venule into the Virch- ow–Robin space. Second, they then must penetrate the glia limitans to finally reach the parenchyma [144]. Molecular impediments to T-cell function in the CNS include widespread expression of Fas ligand, which induces apoptosis in Fas positive immune cells [144], low expression of MHC in the non-inflamed state [145], which impedes T-cell activation and constitutive expression of B7- H1 on the surface of microglia, which downregulates T-cell activation and cytokine production [146]. Immune system–Glioma interactions: In spite of the efferent and afferent barriers to immune activation, there is some evidence of an immune-mediated anti-tumor response against glioma. Most glioma have tumor infiltrating lym- phocytes (TIL), however, the prognostic significance of this is still controver- sial, with some studies showing a survival benefit associated with increased infiltration [146– 148] and others showing no significant benefit [149, 150]. Furthermore, tumor-specific CD8+ T cells have been detected in the peripheral blood of patients with GBM [151]. These cells produce IFN-g when incubated with autologous tumor cells as well as with DC pulsed with the U118 GBM tumor line, but not with unstimulated DC alone or U118 alone. The limited activation of the immune response versus GBM supports the theory that the tumor is actively escaping or impeding immune surveillance. The most commonly cited mechanisms of glioma immune escape include impaired tumor–T-cell binding, resistance to T-cell-mediated killing, production of immunomodulatory surface molecules, factors, and cytokines, and recruit- ment/generation of regulatory T cells (Treg) [152]. Impaired tumor-T-cell binding can be mediated through glycosaminoglycan coats that directly block cell–cell binding [153]; decreased expression of cell–cell binding proteins such as intracel- lular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) [154]; and decreased expression of proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation such as transporter associated with antigen processing-1 and human leukocyte antigen-1 (HLA-1) [155]. 496 M.A. Tyler et al. Mechanisms of direct resistance to T–cell-mediated killing include downregula- tion of Fas [156] and production of soluble decoy receptor for Fas ligand [157], increased production of anti-apoptotic proteins resulting from constitutive acti- vation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3). Immuno- modulatory surface molecules include B7-H1, which binds PD-1 to inhibit T-cell activation and cytokine secretion [158], Fas ligand, which allows the tumor to kill activated immune cells [159], and ectopic HLA-G which binds to an inhibitory receptor on both NK cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes [160]. Secretion of immunosuppressive factors such as TGF-b2, IL-10, and pros- taglandin E2 plays an important role in suppressing T-cell activation and facilitating glioma immune escape. TGF-b2 acts to suppress immune response in numerous ways: it inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation [161, 162]; downregulates MHC II expression [163]; inhibits function of mononuclear phagocytes and microglial cells [164]; and inhibits function of cytotoxic lym- phocytes through inhibiting production of perforin, granzyme A and B, IFN-g, and Fas ligand [165, 166]. IL-10 inhibits the immune system by impairing maturation, activation and function of antigen presenting cells [167] as well as T-cell proliferation in response to IL-2 [168]. Prostaglandin E2 blocks the pro- inflammatory action of cyclooxygenase [169], inhibits T-cell and NK-cell acti- vation and shifts the T-cell repertoire toward a Th-2, B cell, antibody-mediated immunity instead of Th-1, CTL-mediated immunity [169]. Treg are a subset of CD4+ T cells that have been shown to suppress immune responses by rendering conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconv) anergic, i.e., unable to trigger an immune response when presented with their cognate antigen [170]. Our lab and others have demonstrated increased Treg infiltration into glioma tumors [171, 172] and that this infiltration correlates with tumor grade [173]. Immunotherapy in Glioma: Immunmotherapeutic strategies rely on the immune system’s ability to mount a clearance of foreign entities based on the recognition of specific antigens. Thus, much of the research in cancer immu- notherapy aims at sensitizing the host’s immune system to cancer antigens, or boosting the host’s immune system, in an attempt to generate a host immune reaction to the resident tumor, and, ideally, a sustained and ‘learned’ anti- tumor immune response. Therapies fall into three major categories: immune priming strategies, adoptive immunotherapy, and immunomodulation. Immune priming strategies seek to correct the defects of the afferent arm through vaccination with tumor-specific antigens as well as transfer of dendritic cells loaded with tumor antigens. Adoptive immunotherapy works through the efferent arm of the immune system by transferring sensitized immune cells in the hope that they will attack the tumor directly. Immunomodulatory strategies seek to recalibrate the regulatory networks that have been subverted by the glioma in an attempt to generate anti-tumor immune reactivity. Because these strategies share many overlapping features, we have chosen to organize immu- notherapy approaches according to cell-based and non-cell-based approaches, both of which constitute major areas in cancer immunotherapy. Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 497 4.3.1 Non-Cell-Based Immunotherapy Generating Tumor-Specific Immunity: Peptide Vaccines One of the most promising approaches to overcoming immune suppression has been the use of peptide vaccines derived from tumor antigens to prime the immune system to respond to the tumor. Just as vaccines are engineered to generate immune protection in anticipation of pathogen infection, so are they generated to combat tumor recurrence and progression. Potential tumor anti- gens fall into two categories, namely, ‘tumor associated’, which are expressed in other tissues, but over-expressed within the tumors; and, ‘tumor specific’, composed of antigens that are only found within the tumor. These antigens are generated by somatic mutation of normal proteins that would otherwise be considered ‘tumor associated’ if it were not for the existence of a somatic mutation in clonal populations of tumor cells. Tumor-specific antigens are greatly preferred because of the consequences of collateral damage with the brain are particularly grave given its vulnerability to inflammation and inability to regenerate. Vaccines can be screened using techniques such as ‘reverse immunogenetics’. With reverse immunogenetics, peptides – whether endogen- ous or genetically engineered – can be eluted from MHC-class peptide clefts and screened for their ability to generate classic immune responses in vitro, such as T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, humoral immune response (antibody production), and others. Vaccines with high immunogenecity are used in vivo by themselves, or with cellular co-administrations, such as DC (discussed below). We discuss in detail the generation of a peptide generated to mount an immune response against the EGFRvIII peptide. As mentioned above, EGFRvIII is an attractive target because it is not expressed in normal tissues but is expressed in a wide number of malignancies including breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancers [174– 176] as well as between 31 and 50% of malignant gliomas [177, 178]. Initial pre-clinical studies targeting EGFRvIII in rodents were promising; a peptide vaccine developed targeting the novel EGFRvIII epitope was successful in raising antibodies, stimulating a CTL response and extending survival [179– 181]. The success of these pre-clinical studies led to several human trials that have also produced promising results. VICTORI was the first Phase I human trial of the EGFRvIII keyhole limpet vaccine (PEPvIII-KLH). The vaccine was well tolerated and showed promise [182]. The Duke-based study enrolled 20 patients with a WHO grade III or IV glioma who had undergone gross resection and radiotherapy. Qualified patients (n ¼ 16) received three intradermal administrations of the vaccine at 2 week intervals via PEPvIII-KLH-pulsed autologous dendritic cells. The vaccine was successful in stimulating cellular immunity; post-vaccination restimulation with the peptide alone gave rise to a delayed hypersensitivity response in 5 of 13 patients and a positive in vitro proliferation response from samples of 10 of 13 patients. The clinical results were also promising; no major adverse effects was reported and among grade III patients, 2 of 3 had stable disease at 66 and 123 months, while among the 13 GBM patients, mean time of progression 498 M.A. Tyler et al. was 46.9 weeks and median survival was 110.8 weeks. For the phase II trial of ACTIVATE, the study was expanded to include MD Anderson and the protocol was simplified to eliminate autologous DC and instead deliver the PEPvIII-KLH peptide vaccine along with GM-CSF to stimulate DC maturation in situ. Pre- liminary results indicate the vaccine was well tolerated and ex vivo studies have demonstrated humoral and cellular immunity; final results have not yet been reported [182]. A phase III comparing EGFRvIII vaccine and GM-CSF versus the alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ), on the basis of progression-free survival for 6 months, overall survival, and immune response, is underway and expected to be completed in the near future (NCT00458601). One of the potential problems facing tumor vaccine researchers is the possi- bility of immunoediting, in which targeting a specific peptide merely selects for variants that lack that peptide. This was observed in the original murine experiments investigating the EGFRvIII peptide vaccine [175] in which recur- rent tumors that were EGFRvIII negative developed in 15% of the surviving mice. One approach to avoid immunoediting is to target multiple peptides in a tumor, either through autologous whole tumor vaccines or personalized pep- tide vaccines. The personal peptide vaccine approach screens patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for reactivity against a panel of tumor associated and specific peptides and then inoculates them with the best matches. In a 2005 phase I trial 25 patients (8 with AA and 17 with GBM) were screened and treated with up to four peptide vaccines [183]. The vaccine was well tolerated and the majority showed increased cellular and humoral responses. Clinical results were moderately favorable with 5 of 21 showing partial radio- graphic response, 8 of 21 showing stable disease, and 8 of 21 showing progres- sive disease. Median survival among GBM patients was 622 days. Other tumor vaccine targets under investigation include cytochrome p450 [184], telomerase [185], GALT3 [186], survivin [187], tenascin [188], glycoprotein 240 [189], and SART1 [190]. Immunomodulatory Strategies Attempts to counteract the inherent immunosuppressive activities of malignant glioma have focused primarily on changing the cytokine environment. This has involved either seeking to replace or supplement immuno-activating cytokines, such as IL-2, that are missing or otherwise present at low levels in the tumor micro-environment, or, conversely, to counteract immunosuppressive cyto- kines such as transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-b2 ) that are present at abnormally high levels. In addition, recent pre-clinical research has revealed a role for Treg in immune escape and new studies are focusing on depleting or otherwise counteracting these cells. TGF-b2 is known to be one of the most potent immunosuppressive molecules produced in the body and is commonly over-expressed in glioma. It is capable of interfering with both the afferent arm by downregulating MHC expression [191] and the efferent arm by directly inhibiting effector cells [192– 194]. Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 499 Fakhri and colleagues sought to block TGF-b2 in order to make a more effective vaccine [195]. They injected six GBM patients with a whole cell vaccine comprised of tumor cells genetically modified with a TGF-b2 anti-sense trans- gene. This blocked tumor cells’ ability to produce TGF-b2 and thereby improved the immune system’s ability to raise both CTL and humoral immune responses. Most importantly, median survival was increased when compared to historical controls (68 weeks versus 47 weeks). In a phase I/II trial of 24 patients with malignant glioma, Hau and colleagues tested anti-sense oligonucleotides to directly block production of TGF-b1 [196]. Results were very encouraging. Two AA patients experienced complete remissions and overall survival times in both AA and GBM patients, 146.6 weeks and 44 weeks, respectively, were increased relative to historical controls. Targeting Treg to limit glioma immunosuppression is supported by pre- clinical data from murine models. It is reasonable to suggest that a population of lymphocytes exist in the tumor mass to sequester pro-inflammatory cyto- kines. Data from our lab indicate that depleting Treg with anti-CD25 antibo- dies (PC61) prolongs survival without inducing autoimmunity [197]. Other labs have achieved similar results with both anti-CD25 [198] and anti-CTLA-4 [199] antibodies. Finally, there is data to suggest that temozolomide may decrease tumor progression of the Treg chemoattractant CCL2 [200]. Data from Grauer suggest that depleting Treg prior to vaccination with tumor lysate-pulsed DC greatly increased the efficacy of the vaccine [201]. Recent data from the Castro lab suggest that the timing of Treg depletion is critical. When glioma-bearing mice were treated with PC61 antibody early on in disease course, Treg were depleted and the adenoviral tumor vectors were more effective in inducing a CTL response [202]. However, when the mice were treated later in the disease course, the PC61 antibody also affected CD4+ and CD8+ effector cells and weakened the immune response. Although there is not yet any published data on Treg and human glioma, a clinical trial at Duke is currently recruiting patients for Treg depletion with Daclizumab, an anti-CD25 alpha antibody accompanied by TMZ and an RNA-pulsed DC vaccine [203]. Immunomodulatory therapy, particularly interventions that target Treg and TGF-b2 , represents one of the most exciting developments in glioma thera- peutics. It offers the possibility of reversing glioma immunosuppression, which has been a major unseen obstacle to the efficacy of other immunotherapies, and as such, it brings new hope for achieving the potential benefits that have been so difficult to realize in the transition from murine to human experiments. 4.3.2 Cell-Based Immunotherapy Dendritic Cell-Based Strategies Dendritic cell (DC)-based strategies seek to leverage the critical role DC play in the afferent arm of the immune system. DC are the most potent APC and are capable of presenting antigen on both MHC I and MHC II. With their ability to 500 M.A. Tyler et al. stimulate a variety of afferent and efferent immune cell types, DC represent a crucial integrative regulator between the innate and adaptive immune arms. Because of these qualities, it was thought that DC would be more effective at overcoming tumor immunosuppression than directly injected peptide vaccines. Thus much of the recent work involving anti-tumor vaccines have focused on DC as a main component in the development of tumor vaccines. Typically DC are harvested from bone marrow (i.e., from the patient or a partially matched donor), expanded ex vivo with GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF-a, then pulsed with either known tumor antigens, patient-derived tumor lysates, or RNA, and then re-infused. This process is technically challenging and this has led some inves- tigators, such as in the ACTIVATE study described above, to turn back to alternatives such as direct injection of tumor vaccines and cytokine adjuvants to activate local DC at the injection site. Although DC have been tested with individual peptides targeting specific tumor antigens, notably EGFRvIII and survivin, a major part of their appeal is that they can be used with whole tumor lysates or peptides eluted from tumor MHC I that would presumably target multiple tumor antigens, preventing tumor immunoediting and recurrence of tumor cells lacking that specific antigen. The main concern with the tumor lysate and related approaches is that they run the risk of breaking self-tolerance and inducing an auto-immune encephalitis. However, this risk remains theore- tical and to date no such reactions have been reported. In HGG-IMMUNO, one of the largest DC studies to date, De Vleeschouwer’s group treated 56 recurrent GBM patients with autologous early mature DC pulsed with autologous tumor lysates [204]. Patients were divided into three cohorts that each received between two and five induction vaccinations fol- lowed by either booster vaccinations or tumor lysates every 4 weeks. Although the majority of adverse reactions were mild, there was one grade IV neurotoxi- city reaction and several grade II hematological reactions. Clinical response was mixed, although median progression-free survival and overall survival were not impressive at 3 and 9.6 months, respectively, overall survival at 24 and 36 months was encouraging at 14.8 and 11.1%. While the differences between treatment arms were not statistically significant, there was a trend supporting longer overall survival in Cohort C which received 4 weekly induction vaccina- tions followed by boosters of tumor lysates only. Although the results from HGG-IMMUNO are disappointing, multiple human trials investigating the use of autologous DC pulsed with autologous tumor lysates in glioma are ongoing or recently completed. Results from these trials are expected to clarify the value of such strategies. These include two dose escalation trials at UCLA in pediatric patients by Lasky and Liau [205, 206], a phase II trial at Cedars Sinai by Yu which is expected to be completed in 2008 [207], and a phase II trial comparing patients treated with conventional ther- apy (including TMZ) and tumor lysates pulsed DC with historical controls which was recently completed by Fadul at Dartmouth and is awaiting publica- tion [208]. Finally a large multi-institutional randomized placebo-controlled phase II study evaluating DCVax, a commercial tumor lysate-pulsed DC Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 501 preparation, is underway [209]. Other alternatives to tumor lysates include apoptotic bodies and whole tumor RNA. Although neither is in glioma clinical trials, the early data from animal experiments are promising. The Pollack lab showed increased survival in a rat model using DC that were cocultured with apoptotic tumor cells [210]. The Kobayashi group pulsed DC from five GBM patients with tumor mRNA and was able to raise a strong tumor-specific CTL response [211]. Peptide-pulsed DC approaches under study include hyaluronan mRNA [212] and SART-1 [213]. The Jadus lab recently published a proof of principle paper showing that allogenic partially HLA-matched tumor lines could be used to generate peptides for vaccine generation or pulsing dendritic cells [214]. The great potential suggested by pre-clinical trials of DC vaccines remains unrealized. While a small minority of patients seem to have benefited in certain trials, for the majority, concrete benefits are elusive. Significant work remains to be done in optimizing protocols and identifying those most likely to respond. It remains to be determined which is the most effective DC subtype, method of generation, loading protocol, dose and route of administration. The Sloan lab sought to begin answering these questions by directly comparing four of the most common whole tumor DC-based therapies [215]. Working with patient- derived PMBC, they compared DC fused with MHC-matched glioma cells (Fusion), DC pulsed with apoptotic tumor cells (DC/APO), DC pulsed with total tumor ribonucleic acid (DC/RNA), and DC pulsed with tumor lysates (DC/Lys). They found that none of the preparations produced significantly more mature DC than any other and that both DC/RNA and DC/APO were better at inducing CTL from PBMC than Fusion or DC/Lys. However, DC/ APO also produced significantly more NKT cells which could potentially lyse glioma cells in a non-MHC I-dependent fashion. On this basis they judged DC/ APO superior. Adoptive Transfer Immunotherapy Adoptive therapy attempts to overcome blocks to the efferent arm of the immune system by harvesting immune cells from the patient, manipulating them to activate them or otherwise increase their effectiveness and then re- infusing them to target the tumor. Classically, the cell types used have included peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK), tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL). Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells Interest in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells followed Rosenberg’s pilot treatment of four lung or liver cancer patients with LAK cells [216] and in vitro experiments demonstrating LAK lysed 36 of the 41 tumor samples tested but did not attack allogenic non-tumor tissue [217]. Unfortunately, the majority of studies that used LAK in glioma did not live up the initial high hopes 502 M.A. Tyler et al. surrounding the therapy, although many showed clinical or radiographic improvements, most failed to show any survival benefit [218– 223]. The most positive reports came from Hayes and colleagues in a phase I study in which 19 patients with recurrent disease (15 GBM and 4 AA) were treated with surgery followed by intratumoral LAK and IL-2 [224]. This study differed from previous studies in their explicit restrictions on steroid use during immu- notherapy. Steroids were reduced or eliminated when possible, although they were available as bolus treatments for acute symptoms of IL-2 toxicity. CNS toxicities related to IL-2 occurred and were dose related; they included transient cerebral edema, confusion, and decreased alertness. All toxicities resolved with a steroid bolus. Results were very encouraging among GBM patients; there were two partial radiographic responses and one complete response that occurred 17 months after treatment. One of the four AA patients had a com- plete response. Most impressively, the median survival for GBM patients was 53 weeks post-reoperation, with 53% alive after 1 year, while a contemporary control group treated with chemotherapy alone had a median survival of 25.5 weeks and only 6% were alive after 1 year. Hayes reported that as of 1999 both complete response patients were still alive [225]. The largest study of intratumoral LAK therapy was conducted by Dillman and colleagues and comprised 40 patients who were reoperated on for recurrent GBM [226]. IL-2 was given to 23 of the patients at infusion, but dose and schedule were not specified. However, receipt of IL-2 did not have a significant effect on survival (p ¼ 0.24). Adverse effects were not described. Median survi- val among the 31 patients who had a consistent diagnosis of GBM at both initial presentation and re-operation was significantly higher than comparable histor- ical controls, 17.5 months versus 13.6 months (p ¼ 0.012). Survival at 6 months and 2 years were superior as well, at 69 and 31%, respectively. Median survival also compared favorably with reports in the literature which ranges from 4.3 [227] to 8.6 months [228]. Work from the Ohno lab indicated that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) could be harvested from patient tumors and that they had significantly greater lytic activity than LAK on a per cell basis [229]. Quattrocchi and colleagues reported results from a phase I trial using TIL and IL-2. Six patients with recurrent glioma (3 AA and 3 GBM) were treated with 1\u0003109 autologous TIL and IL-2 [230]. Adverse effects were mild, one patient complained of transient low grade fevers and two developed asymptomatic hydrocephalus. All patients developed transient cerebral edema but none required steroids. Clinical out- comes were encouraging, at 3 and 6 months three patients showed partial radiographic response. Two died at 12 months and one at 18 months post- immunotherapy. At 45 months 3 of 6 patients were still alive. Despite this, interest in TIL was supplanted by interest in antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. Interest in using tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes grew out of evidence of the immunological deficiencies present in studies using TIL and the belief that enhancing specificity for tumor would increase efficacy. Although TIL Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 503 were able to lyse glioma cells, they displayed two log lower proliferative capa- city, even when stimulated with strong reagents such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) [231]. TIL, particularly the CD4+ fraction, produced less IL-2 upon stimulation and had lower IL-2 receptor expression than control lymphocytes [232, 233]. Experiments by researchers working in a melanoma model demon- strated that it was possible to produce tumor-specific CTL from lymph nodes of immunized patients [234]. Furthermore, CTL were shown to home to tumor sites and were shown to reject tumors in animal models of glioma [235]. Kitahara and colleagues demonstrated that tumor-specific CTL could be generated from peripheral blood without prior immunization with tumor [236]. Five patients with malignant glioma were treated with intratumoral autologous tumor-specific CTL. One patient with GBM showed temporary regression for 20 weeks prior to recurrence, while three others recurred quickly and died. One patient with primary mixed AA-GBM, had near complete tumor regression on CT at 104 weeks remained healthy and without neural deficits. Several studies followed seeking to build on Kitahara’s results by using adjuvants such as Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) injections prior to PBMC harvest, IL-2 and GM-CSF prior to PBMC harvest in order to increase CTL yield and efficacy. In a follow-up study of nine patients with grade III or IV malignant glioma, anti-CD3 antibody and IL-2 were used in place of autologous tumor cells and IL-2 for post-vaccination restimulation of PMBCs [237]. Adverse effects from infusion were minor and transient and were limited to fever, chills, and nausea. Clinical results were mixed. The response among patients with grade III disease was very encouraging. Two patients had complete or near complete radiographic tumor regression and were alive and disease free at 4 and 5 years post-recurrence, while a third showed partial regression with no effect on survival. Among the GBM patients there were no signs of regression and no effect on survival. Median survival post-recurrence in this group was 6 months. Plautz and colleagues also pursued an autologous tumor immunization model to raise tumor-specific CTL but replaced BCG with GM-CSF and harvested lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes instead of from peripheral blood [238]. Ten patients, two with progressive primary and eight with recur- rent GBM, were treated. Adverse effects were minor, with fever the most common. There were no serious toxicities. Clinical effects were mixed. There were two patients that showed 6 months radiographic regression and one that had stable disease for 17 months but the remainder had progressive disease. The most encouraging result of the trial was that of the 8 patients with recurrent GBM, half were still alive 1 year after the re-operation and immunotherapy. In a 2000 follow-up study, Plautz and colleagues sought to confirm their findings using a group of 12 newly diagnosed patients, two with grade II astro- cytoma, four with AA, and six with GBM [239]. Patients were free of corticoster- oids during immunotherapy and were preconditioned with cyclophosphamide and acetaminophen. Clinical results included partial radiographic regression in four of eight patients with visible residual disease following initial surgery. Among the patients with GBM, four had gross residual disease post surgery 504 M.A. Tyler et al. and two showed partial regression that occurred several months after treatment. Survival statistics were not calculated because of small sample size and hetero- geneity, but among the patients with GBM, median time to progression was 11 months, with the two who showed partial radiographic response at 14 months and greater than 29 months. While adoptive transfer immunotherapy techniques have produced some scattered clinical successes and shown glimmers of promise, results from over 30 years of research remain unsatisfactory. Much of the initial interest has waned as attention has shifted to other techniques such as tumor vaccination and dendritic cell vaccination. However, recent findings have the potential to re- invigorate the field. Among the most interesting is work from the Agur lab in creating a mathematical model of glioma–immune system interactions [240]. The model takes into account adoptively transferred CTL, the patients own CTL, tumor size, growth rate, MHC-class I and II expression, and the cytokine micro- environment. The model was then tested against clinical trial data and model predictions were compared with actual trial results. In the case of results from Kruse’s group [241], the model predicted both the treatment success of the AA patients and the failure of the GBM patients. Based on predictions from the model and the biological differences between tumor types, Agur predicts that the number of CTL used in protocols needs to be increased by 20-fold. These conclusions are supported by recent data re-evaluating the role of age as a prognostic factor. Wheeler and colleagues found that the number of recent thymic emigrant CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood was a better predictor of clinical outcome than age in vaccine trials [242]. This suggests that decreasing capacity for thymic production of new CD8 + T cells may play an important role in glioma immune escape. Taken together with the data from the Agur lab, it suggests that adoptive CTL therapies at higher doses merit further investigation. 5 Conclusions Malignant brain tumors represent a group of cancers that have eluded success- ful treatment strategies since they were first described. Indeed, the heteroge- neous nature of malignant brain tumors and complex physiology of the CNS have stumped researchers’ and physicians’ attempts at treating this disease for many years. However, the rapid evolution in our understanding of the mole- cular underpinnings and complex physiologies of brain tumors have allowed researchers to develop novel treatment approaches which have changed the once devastating nature of this disease. The research that has gone into these developments has warranted the application of some of the most sophisticated and innovative approaches in experimental therapeutics. Translating these developments into successful clinical application will rely on the development of novel technologies in diagnostics and an improved understanding of the complex physiology of CNS tumors. Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 505 While not discussed in this chapter, the development of novel imaging technologies that better define a brain tumor’s pathogenic characteristics will greatly enhance the development and application of targeted therapeutics. Markers that are capable of mapping molecular and physical traits responsible for the aggressive and drug-resistant nature of brain tumors will allow the application of targeted therapies and delivery paradigms, such as CED and IA delivery, to reach their full potential. While CED is still a novel delivery approach, it possesses vast potential. When we understand the parameters which dictate fluid flow in the cancerous brain tissue, CED can most effectively be applied to deliver experimental agents such as cells, viruses, liposome, and polymer formulations. In addition, state-of-the-art imaging developments will allow for the development of novel and improved non-invasive approaches for brain tumor targeting strategies. Like many translational approaches in medicine, improved therapeutic application in brain tumors will arise with relevant discoveries in the basic sciences. Our understanding of how certain proteins and receptors partake in aberrant signal transduction cascades is still somewhat limited in scope. A greater understanding of the role of specific proteins in cellular physiology will allow the proper application of targeted molecular therapies, such as growth factor inhibitors and gene therapy. In addition, a more detailed under- standing of how genetic and molecular aberrations contribute to the cancer pathology as a tissue will do much to improve novel applications. Understand- ing the role of different tissue compartments in the tumor, such as the tumor stroma, will speed these developments. Immunotherapy for brain tumor thera- pies symbolizes a very promising and exciting treatment strategy for brain tumors and cancer in general. An understanding of the immune system’s role in the healthy and diseased brain will enhance the development of sophisticated protocols that can lead to most optimal treatment outcome using these approaches. The physiological barriers in the CNS still continue to confound researchers’ efforts to deliver drugs to the brain. A greater understanding of the BBB in health and disease will do much to optimize drug delivery to brain tumors. In summary, these understandings may one day lead to treatment algorithms which can include a combination of different treatment approaches and delivery strategies more extensive and effective than those used today, to the extent that the goals of molecular medicine come to fruition.

Targeted Therapies for Malignant Brain Tumors 519 The Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer Presents Multiple Avenues for Therapeutic Intervention Tiffany N. Seagroves Abstract A critical aspect of tumor physiology is the sensation of oxygen in the microenvironment. The oxygen-responsive Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1a protein is a master transcriptional regulator of the hypoxic response, controlling expression of a variety of genes related to metabolism, glucose transport, cell cycle progression, cell migration, multidrug resistance, and angiogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated that over-expression HIF-1a protein in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis, increased risk of metastasis and decreased survi- val. Moreover, hypoxic regions of tumors are believed to be the source of tumor cells that are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. More recently, it has also been proposed that hypoxia stimulates expansion of normal and cancer stem cells. Despite a complete understanding of how HIF-1a impacts breast cancer progression and metastasis, the HIF-1a pathway is ideal for targeting drug design since interfering with a master regulator of the hypoxic response could disrupt multiple downstream processes essential to tumor cell self-renewal, expansion, dissemination, and metastatic colonization. 1 Introduction to the HIF-1a Pathway and Its Relevance to Breast Cancer 1.1 Relevance of Hypoxia to Tumorigenesis In response to hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, cells try to restore homeostasis through regulation of cellular metabolism, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and balancing decisions between survival and cell death [1]. As part of adaptation to their local microenvironment, most solid tumors have bypassed the normal cellular controls that regulate these processes [2]. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a transcription factor is a master regulator of the hypoxic response in T.N. Seagroves (*) Center for Cancer Research, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA e-mail: tseagro1@utmem.edu Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_16, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 521 multiple cell types, directly and indirectly controlling activation and repression of hundreds of genes [3–5]. Zhong et al. first reported in 1999 that HIF-1a protein, detected by immunohistochemistry, was over-expressed in the majority of solid tumors that had originated in multiple tissue types (13/19 tissues), including the breast. In fact, HIF-1a was over-expressed in 29% of primary late-stage breast carcinomas and perhaps more significantly, 69% of metastases from the breast [6]. As expected, HIF-1a protein was also detected in layers of cells immediately surrounding necrotic areas of tumors, however, no expression was detectable within ‘‘normal’’ breast tissue adjacent to tumors [6]. A study of breast cancers by Bos et al. followed in 2001, in which high levels of HIF-1a immunostaining were found to be positively correlated with other clinical prognostic factors including high proliferation rates, increased tumor grade, and positive staining for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/Neu [7], also known as ERBB2. In this study, a majority of well- differentiated (11/20) and poorly differentiated (17/20) ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) samples over-expressed HIF-1a, whereas over-expression was noted in all (20/20) tumors classified as poorly differentiated invasive carcino- mas [7]. Moreover, several clinical studies have demonstrated that over-expres- sion of HIF-1a in breast cancer patients correlates with aggressiveness, and ultimately, poor prognosis and decreased survival [8–11]. In fact, in a large retrospective study on patients who had surgery from 1986 to 1995 without chemotherapy or hormone therapy prior to surgery, HIF-1a expression inde- pendently correlated with high risk of metastasis and with an increased chance of relapse [12]. Hypoxia also impacts the clinical response to therapy. Hypoxic regions of tumors in which HIF-1a is abundant are resistant to therapeutic interventions, including ionizing radiation and a variety of chemotherapeutics, as reviewed in [13, 14]. Moreover, hypoxic induction of HIF-1a is a potent mechanism to down- regulate ERa protein in breast cancer cells [15], suggesting that chronic hypoxia may contribute to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer as only ER+ patients respond to tamoxifen therapy. Finally, it has also been proposed that hypoxia stimulates renewal and expansion of normal and cancer stem cells (CSCs) [16]. This concept is highly relevant to breast cancer patients since studies have demonstrated that the population of breast tumor cells that have the ability to self-renew are enriched with the ability to initiate tumorigenesis in vivo [17–21]. Moreover, breast cancer cells that exhibit properties of CSCs are the most resistant to therapeutic intervention, including radiation and DNA damaging drugs [20, 22, 23]. These topics will be discussed in further detail later in this chapter. According to American Cancer Society, the 5-year survival rate drops from 98% for women who are diagnosed with localized breast tumors to 80% for women with regional metastasis and 26% for women with distant metastases [24]. Therefore, understanding the contribution of the hypoxic response to breast cancer is of critical significance not only for designing treatment for primary tumors that contain hypoxic regions resistant to intervention but also for pre- venting metastasis since HIF-1a may control a metastatic switch. Despite a 522 T.N. Seagroves complete understanding of how HIF-1a impacts breast epithelial cell tumorigen- esis and metastasis, the HIF-1a pathway is ideal for targeted drug design since interfering with a master regulator of the hypoxic response could disrupt multiple downstream processes essential to tumor cell expansion and dissemination. 1.2 Overview of the HIF-1 Pathway HIF-1a is the oxygen-responsive partner of the HIF-1 heterodimer, which functions as a transcription factor, and binds to the hypoxic response elements (HREs) in target gene promoters; the HRE consensus site is 50-RCGTG-3 0 [25]. There are also two other HIF-a isoforms in mammals, HIF-2a and HIF-3a, which bind to the same HRE consensus. HIF-1 controls transcription of multi- ple gene families including glycolytic metabolism, glucose transport, cell cycle progression, growth factors, cell migration and adhesion, multidrug resistance, and angiogenesis [4, 5]. As shown in Fig. 1, HIF-1a levels are regulated primar- ily at the post-translational level via proteosome-dependent protein stability. Hypoxic exposure induces and stabilizes HIF-1a protein accumulation, although the oxygen tensions at which HIF-1a is stabilized are tissue-type dependent [26]. More importantly, up to 50% of locally advanced breast cancers exhibit heterogenous regions of hypoxia that correspond to 0.1–1% O2 [27], which is in the range of oxygen exposure commonly used to model tissue hypoxia in vitro. In contrast, HIF-1a’s partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein (or HIF-1b), is expressed con- stitutively and can heterodimerize with multiple other bHLH partners [25]. Fig. 1 Oxygen-dependent stabilization of HIF-1a.(Left) At 21% O2, HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes hydroxylate HIF-1a on two key proline resides, permitting physical interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which in conjunction with a Cullin2/Skp1/Elongin-B/C (VBC) complex, functions as a E3 ubiqutin ligase, leading to rapid HIF-1a proteolytic degradation. (Right) Under hypoxic stress, PHD activity is reduced, HIF-1a is stabilized and partners with ARNT (orange oval) to form the HIF-1 heterodimer, which binds HREs within target gene promoters. Classic direct target genes include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter-1 (SLC2A1), and phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK1). (Center) Western blot: Strong hypoxic induction of HIF-1a protein in primary mammary murine epithelial cells cultured overnight at 0.5% O2 Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 523 The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains of HIF-1a, which mediate DNA-binding and HIF-1b interactions, respectively, are located at the N-terminus, whereas the C-terminal half of HIF-1a contains three important domains: the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain, a nuclear translocation signal, and two transactivation domains (N-terminal, N-TAD and C-terminal, C-TAD). The ODD domain is comprised of the region that binds to the tumor suppressor protein von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) as well as the N-TAD. The ODD contains two key proline residues (Pro402 and Pro564) that are hydroxylated by a family of HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes, PHD 1-3 [2]. Activity of the PHDs depends on the presence of oxygen, iron, and 2-oxoglutarate as co-factors [28]. The consequence of PDH-mediated hydroxylation is rapid, 26S proteosome-dependent degradation of HIF-1a, reliant upon its interaction with VHL, which is part of a larger Cullin2/ EloginB/C protein complex (VBC) that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The necessity for tight control of the HIFa subunits’ stability via VHL is clear from observation of tumors that develop in patients with VHL disease, which are characterized by high levels of expression of the HIFa subunits, and down- stream HIF target genes, as reviewed in [29]. In addition, it has been shown that breast cancer cells that express lower VHL levels have higher levels of HIF-1a, as would be expected [30]. More recently, a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase, hypoxia- associated factor (HAF), has been reported to target HIF-1a, but not HIF-2a, for proteolytic degradation independent of oxygen tension[31]. Over-expres- sion of HAF led to decreased HIF-1a expression and decreased tumor growth. HIF-1a is also hydroxylated on Asn803 in the C-TAD by the asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor inhibiting HIF-1 (or FIH-1). FIH-1-mediated hydroxyla- tion inhibits the recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator p300/CBP to HIF-1a, thereby inhibiting downstream gene transcription [32]. In sum, in response to hypoxia, there is a dramatic increase in HIF-1a protein expression, as well as enhancement of its transcriptional activity. The potential redundancy in transcriptional regulation between HIF-1a and HIF-2a is an area of intense investigation. Although HIF-1a and HIF-2a are closely related proteins, they have been shown to regulate different target gene sets depend- ing on the cell type and microenvironment context [33–39]. Although HIF-2a was originally reported to be highly enriched in the vasculature, is also expressed in multiple other tissues [40], and it has been shown to have an essential role in promoting renal clear cell carcinoma[41]. HIF-3a lacks critical TADs conserved in HIF-1a and HIF-2a, and therefore may act as a dominant-negative inhibitor [42]. In addition to HIF-1a, breast cancer cells also express HIF-2a.However, in a study of a panel of breast cancer cell lines, HIF-2a expression was low to undetectable, suggesting that HIF-1a is the primary regulator of the hypoxic response in the breast [43]. This was later confirmed using siRNAs to either HIF- 1a or HIF-2a and analyzing mRNA expression of key HIFa target genes [36]. However, a recent study that characterized expression of HIF-1a and HIF-2a immunostaining in breast cancers identified HIF-2a as the predominant HIFa subunit that independently predicted survival [44]. Therefore, there is still 524 T.N. Seagroves controversy regarding whether HIF-1a or HIF-2a is the predominant player in predicting breast cancer survival, although it is clear that the HIF-dependent hypoxic response pathway is a key mediator of breast cancer pathology. Further- more, a large-scale microarray profiling screen has recently identified a 123-gene ‘‘hypoxic signature’’ that functions as an independent predictor of prognosis and survival in breast cancer patients, which exhibited more predictive power than the previously described ‘‘wound’’ signature in breast cancer [3]. 1.3 Use of Mouse Models to Understand HIF-1 Function 1.3.1 Conditional Knockout of HIF-1a During Normal Mammary Gland Development Due to embryonic lethality associated with global knockout of HIF-1a [45], the use of genetic mouse models to understand HIF-1a function in various tissues and cell types has focused on the Cre/loxP conditional gene deletion strategy [46], as reviewed in [47]. Deletion of both HIF-1a ‘‘floxed’’ (flanked by loxP) alleles [48] in the mammary epithelium is accomplished using transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase under control of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the MTMV promoter [49, 50]. Using this approach, it was demonstrated that HIF-1a expression is critical for differentiation, but not proliferation, of the mammary gland during pregnancy and for milk production and secretion at lactation [51]. The first stage at which the glands lacking HIF-1a in the differed by histology was at day 15 of pregnancy (15-P). This time point represents a period of mammary gland development that is well into the period termed ‘‘secretory differentiation,’’ which is characterized by expression of milk protein genes, such as b-casein and a-lactalbumin, markers of the casein, and whey fractions of milk, respectively [52]. In addition, by 15-P there was accumulation of large cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs) and proteinaceous material within the wild-type alveoli, whereas the HIF-1a null alveoli did not exhibit any evidence of differentiation and remained ‘‘collapsed,’’ and devoid of CLDs. mRNA expres- sion of two markers associated with the milk lipid globule, xanthine oxioreduc- tase (Xor) and adipophilin (Adph), was also reduced by over 50% in response to HIF-1a deletion [51]. These phenotypes, evidence of a failure to differentiate, were maintained through the remainder of pregnancy, as shown in Fig. 2. Regulation of these markers by HIF-1a is of interest since ADPH mRNA expression is directly regulated by HIF-1a in MCF-7 cells [53] and deletion of a single copy of Xor gene recapitulates the phenotype observed in HIF-1a null- lactating glands [54]. Moreover, expression of ADPH appears to be required to form CLDs [55]. Therefore, HIF-1a is essential for differentiation of the mammary gland in preparation for lactation by regulating cellular metabolism. Moreover, the results from these studies suggest that although HIF-1a is not detectable by immunostaining of the normal human breast, low levels of HIF- 1a present in normal murine breast tissue are necessary to regulate breast Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 525 physiology. Therefore, it must be considered that inhibitors of the HIF path- way may have adverse effects in the normal breast or in tissue adjacent to tumors. 1.3.2 Conditional Knockout of HIF-1a in a Mouse Model of Breast Cancer Reveals that HIF-1a Is a Key Mediator of Metastasis There are a variety of well-characterized transgenic mice that reproducibly develop mammary tumors; in these models, an oncogene, such as ras, polyoma middle T (PyMT), Neu (the rat homologue of HER2/ERBB2), or c-Myc is expressed under control of the MMTV minimal promoter. Overall, these mod- els mimic the pathology observed in human breast cancers [56, 57], and more importantly, they have a subset of the same molecular lesions to those found in breast cancer patients [58, 59]. The Neu and Myc transgenic models also mimic human cancer in several ways: (1) MYC and ERBB2 are amplified in 17 and 30% of human breast cancer patients, respectively [60], and (2) the tumors exhibit stages of progression in vivo and have a pathology similar to human DCIS and lobular carcinoma [61, 62]. Recently we crossed the MMTV-Cre HIF-1a floxed conditional deletion model to the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse. This model was chosen since tumors produced by the MMTV-PyMT model have been shown to faithfully mimic the pathology of breast cancers [63], and more recently, the luminal subtype of breast cancer [64]. In addition, all nulliparous PyMT transgenic Fig. 2 Heterogenous expression of Cre recombinase in the MMTV-Cre (line A) transgenic mouse during pregnancy. Mammary tissue harvested from a HIF ‘‘double-floxed’’ (DF); MMTV-Cre transgenic mouse at day 18 of pregnancy was immunostained with a polyclonal antibody to Cre recombinase (Novagen) (brown, nuclear stain) and counterstained with hematoxylin (200\u0002 magnification). The Cre-negative alveoli exhibited evidence of milk precursor production, such as CLDs, whereas the Cre-positive staining alveoli did not, as in [51] 526 T.N. Seagroves females develop mammary tumors with a high incidence of lung metastases[63] within 3 months, in contrast to the MMTV-Myc and MMTV-Neu models, which must be bred to exhibit mammary tumors within 4–6 months of age. As shown by the staining for the tissue hypoxia marker hypoxyprobe-1 in Fig. 3, there are large waves of intratumor hypoxia present in murine mammary tumors, as has been documented in breast cancer patients in which oxygen tension was directly measured using an electrode [27]. We found that deletion of HIF-1a in tumor cells expressing the MMTV- PyMT oncogene delayed the time to palpable tumor onset and decreased cellular proliferation and tumor microvessel density during early carcinoma stages at 10 weeks of age. However, tumor wet weight and volume were equivalent at study end point in late-stage carcinomas at 14 weeks of age. Perhaps the most striking effect was that deletion of HIF-1a significantly prolonged survival, likely due to dramatically reduced size and number of metastases to the lung [65] as shown in Fig. 4. 1.3.3 Limitations of Animal Models Although gene deletion models have been useful to confirm that HIF-1a is a critical regulator of breast cancer growth and metastasis, these animal models do not mimic what is actually observed in the clinic, which is over-expression of HIF-1a. Generation of novel transgenic mouse models in which HIF-1a is Fig. 3 Mammary tumors originating in MMTV-PyMT females exhibit distinct regions of hypoxia. Two hours prior to sacrifice, a PyMT+ female transgenic mouse bearing a late- stage mammary carcinoma was injected i.p. with hypoxyprobe-1 (NPI, Inc.), which binds to DNA and protein adducts created by hypoxic exposure[228]. Tumor sections were probed with anti-hypoxyprobe-1 antibodies (brown staining) and counterstained with hematoxylin (200\u0002 magnification) Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 527 over-expressed in the MECs would be a useful resource to address this defi- ciency. Alternatively, stable over-expression of HIF-1a could also be achieved through viral transduction of normal or breast cancer cell lines and transplan- tation of these cells into the cleared mammary fat pad. Furthermore, the molecular analysis of HIF-1a function in breast epithelium has largely been performed in immortalized human breast cancer cell lines cultured in vitro in monolayer on plastic and/or in xenografted immunocompromised mouse mod- els that lack an intact immune response, thereby eliminating the critical influ- ence of the local tissue microenvironment on evaluating the hypoxic response. The mechanisms by which HIF-1a impacts breast cancer growth, aggressive- ness, and therapeutic response are highly complex and likely involve multiple interacting pathways that are microenvironment and cell type-context specific. Moreover, the specific contribution of HIF-1a in the breast tumor epithelial cells versus myoepithelial cells versus stromal cells (including endothelial cells) versus recruited immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages, remains undefined, although the tissue-specific Cre transgenic mouse models reagents to execute these studies are available [47]. 1.4 Oxygen-Independent, Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Regulation of HIF-1: A Key Role for the EGFR Family? Although hypoxia rapidly stabilizes HIF-1a protein, oxygen-independent mechanisms have also been demonstrated to increase/stabilize HIF-1a protein expression, as reviewed in [66]. For example, HIF-1a stability can be induced Fig. 4 Conditional deletion of HIF-1a in MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors reduces the number of lung metastases, particularly macromets. Lungs were harvested from MMTV-PyMT transgenic females bearing late-stage mammary carcinomas by inflating with 10% formalin followed by fixation and paraffin embedding. Sections were prepared at every 100 microns through the lung and then stained with H&E to reveal metastatic lesions, as in[65]. The presence of macrometastases (dashed circle) visible to the naked eye prior to sectioning the lung were only observed in mice bearing HIF-1a wild-type tumors 528 T.N. Seagroves by oncogene activation through Src and Ras, or via activation of a variety of growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs), resulting in increased protein synthesis of HIF-1a. This regulation is independent of oxygen or HIF-1a’s interactions with VHL [66]. For example, in PC3 prostate cancer cells treated with insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [67], HIF-1a was stabilized via either the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways [4]. In MCF-7 cells, over-expression of the HER2 tyrosine kinase receptor or treatment with the ligand heregulin (which binds ERBB3/ERBB4 receptors) was reported to stimulate HIF-1a protein synthesis in a PI3K-dependent manner [68]. Supporting the relevance of these in vitro observations, studies in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma model have shown that the hypoxia-independent over-expression of HIF-1a is an early event in cancer progression, occurring at the hyperplasia stage prior to development of decreased oxygen tensions [69]. Therefore, regulation of HIF-1a expression is not restricted to cells undergoing hypoxic stress, thereby adding an additional layer of complexity to the role of the hypoxic response in cancer. It is also becoming increasingly clear that there are strong interactions between the members of the EGFR family (EGFR/ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERRB4) of RTKs and HIF-1a in tumor cells. These relationships are highly relevant to breast cancer since over-expression of EGFR and HER2 is commonly observed in patients [70]. Constitutive activation of RTKs in breast cancers would likely synergize with tumor hypoxia to further increase HIF-1a stability/expression. For example, in a panel of breast cancer cell lines cultured in the presence of EGF, the levels of HIF-1a protein expressed at normoxia were increased, and HIF-1a synergized with EGFR to regulate survivin expression through the Akt pathway [71]. More recent studies have demonstrated that EGFR expression, independent of its kinase activity, is critical for tumor cell survival. Even a kinase dead EGFR construct prevented tumor cell autophagy through stabilization of the Na+/ glucose co-transporter 1 SGLT1[72], which facilitated tumor cell survival in low glucose conditions, and is a hypoxia-inducible transcriptional target gene [73]. Moreover, it has been shown that the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib (Iressa) decreased HIF-1a protein expression in head and neck squa- mous cell carcinomas through decreased translation mediated through the P13K/ Akt pathway [74]. High levels of HIF-1a expression in A431 squamous vulvar carcinoma cells have also been shown to contribute to resistance to both gefitinib and the EGFR-blocking antibody cetuximab (C225) [75]. Finally, activation of the EGFR by the ligand-transforming growth factor (TGF)a, which is upregu- lated in VHL null renal clear cell carcinomas, stimulates RCC proliferation, whereas this was blocked with treatment with the EGFR inhibitor PD153035 [76]. Together, these observations suggest that combining therapies to block the EGFR and HIF pathways would synergize to kill tumor cells, a strategy that has been previously recommended in an excellent review of HIF-1 inhibitors as anticancer agents [77]. Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 529 1.5 HIF-1a and Angiogenesis Hypoxia resulting from limited diffusion of oxygen from distant or local, but immature, blood vessels is a common feature of solid tumors. Hypoxia is a well- characterized inducer of tumor neo-angiogenesis and VEGF-regulated blood vessel growth, as reviewed in [78]. However, tumor vasculature is distinctly different that normal vasculature, often forming a poorly organized vascular network consisting of primarily immature, tortuous vessels that are leaky, collapsed, or have arterial to venous shunts, creating areas of hypoxic stress, as reviewed in [14]. Ultimately, compromised vessel function and tissue hypoxia leads to resistance to both ionizing radiation and chemotherapy [1]. 1.5.1 VEGF Therapies and Intratumor Hypoxia The connection between the hypoxic response and the angiogenic switch is also clear from pathology of tumors arising in patients with VHL disease; these tumors are characterized by hypervascularity and extremely elevated levels of VEGF expression [79]. VEGF has been shown in animal models of pancreatic cancer to be a key mediator of the angiogenic switch [80]. The demonstrated critical role for VEGF in regulation of tumor neo-angiogenesis and vascular function in a variety of tumor types led the push in the 1990s to develop anti-VEGF blocking anti- bodies, such as Avastin (bevacizumab), which are currently being used as adjuvant therapies in metastatic breast cancer [81]. One drawback of anti-angiogenesis therapy has been the reported rapid re-growth of the vasculature following drug withdrawal. Studies in animal models have postulated that this is perhaps due to tracks of basement membrane and pericytes that remain upon destruction of immature endothelial cells, since new vessels developed rapidly along these ‘‘tracks’’ upon withdrawal of anti-VEGF therapy [82, 83]. Vessel ‘‘normalization’’ as a means to improve therapeutic response has also become a hot topic [84]. It has been observed that use of VEGF blocking antibodies in conjunction with chemotherapy increases the clinical response and reduces intratumor hypoxia, as reviewed in [85], possibly through pruning immature vessels, allowing better tumor perfusion by the more organized, mature vessels. 1.5.2 Relevance of Angiogenesis to Breast Cancer Several studies have noted correlations between high microvessel density (MVD) and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [86–89]. More specifically, HIF-1a over-expression in breast cancer has been associated with increased MVD, increased expression of pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF and basic fibro- blast growth factor (bFGF), and ultimately, poor prognosis [90]. Interestingly, the dual EGFR/VEGFR family kinase inhibitor AEE788 when combined with ionizing radiation was effective in improving tumor oxygenation by reducing intratumor hypoxia and reducing expression of the classic HIF-1a target gene, 530 T.N. Seagroves glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) in tumors derived from the MMTV-Neu (murine HER2 homologue) transgenic model of breast cancer [91]. 1.5.3 Role of HIF-1a in Angiogenesis Is Microenvironment-Context Specific In teratocarcinomas derived from global HIF-1a null embryonic stem (ES) cells, tumor vascularization was dramatically decreased [45, 92]. This find- ing was in contrast to data generated in fibrosarcomas in which HIF-1a had been conditionally deleted; these tumors exhibited a relatively small decrease in MVD in spite of consistently reduced tumor mass [48]. In PyMT-derived mammary tumors, deletion of HIF-1a resulted in a decrease in MVD within early-stage carcinomas, but no difference in MVD was noted in late-stage carcinomas at the study end point [65]. Finally, deletion of HIF-1a in the normal mammary epithelium had neither an effect upon Vegf mRNA production at 15-P nor resulted in changes in MVD or gross vessel branching by the end of pregnancy prior to parturition [51]. Although mice conditionally deleted for Vegf in the mammary epithelium were reported to also exhibit lactation defects similar to the conditional HIF-1a model [93], it is possible that in the normal tissue setting, other factors besides HIF-1a can substitute for regulation of VEGF activity, including estrogen and progesterone, whereas HIF-1a may be required for neo-angiogenesis in breast cancers. Together, these data indicate that the pro-angiogenic effect of HIF-1a is highly sensitive to context-specific dif- ferences in the microenvironment. 1.6 HIF-1a and Tumor Metabolism As tumors enlarge, they exhibit changes in energy metabolism relative to untransformed cells [1]. In the presence of O2 normal tissues primarily utilize oxidative phosphorylation to form ATP from glucose. However, in response to hypoxia, cells switch to a glycolytic metabolism, producing only a fraction of the ATP generated under aerobic conditions. Although glycolysis is less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP, in the presence of sufficient glucose, glycolysis can sustain ATP production due to increases in the activity of the glycolytic enzymes. Many regions within solid tumors adapt to hypoxia by permanently relying on glycolysis to survive, regardless of subsequent exposure to normoxic oxygen levels (i.e., ‘‘aerobic glycolysis’’). This phenomenon is referred to as the ‘‘Warburg effect’’ [94], which also correlates with a higher constitutive level of glycolytic enzyme expression. It is not surprising, therefore, that cancer therapies that inhibit the glycolytic path- way, such as 2-deoxyglucose, decrease the rate of proliferation of transformed cells [95]. Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 531 1.6.1 HIF-1a Is a Key Regulator of Glycolytic Energy Production We have previously demonstrated that HIF-1a is a critical regulator of hypoxic glycolytic metabolism and production of ATP in primary and transformed fibroblasts [96]. Although HIF-1a null cells grown in high-glucose medium at 21% O2 grow at the same rate as wild-type cells during log-phase, at hypoxia (1% O2), exponential growth of HIF-1a null cells was severely impaired. The total amount of free ATP produced under hypoxia by either primary or trans- formed HIF-1a null MEFs was also approximately half that of wild-type cells [96]. Similar results have been obtained in endothelial cells and macrophages in which HIF-1a has been conditionally deleted [97, 98]. Therefore, HIF-1a expression is critical to regulate the metabolism and the proliferative potential of oxygen-depleted cells. 1.6.2 Importance of Glycolysis in the Breast HIF-1a’s role in glycolytic metabolism is also relevant in the breast. HIF-1a protein is stabilized even under normoxic conditions in the metastatic, ERa-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MD-435 and MDA-MB-231, but not in ERa+ MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, glycolytic activity at normoxia was elevated in the MDA-MB-435 cells compared to MCF-7 cells [99]. More recently, Robey et al. have demonstrated that in 10 of 12 low-passage breast cell lines derived from patients, there were significant correlations between glycolytic rate and phosphorylated c-Myc and HIF-1a levels [100]. In addition, HIF-1a expression has been shown to be responsible for resistance of HeLa cells to the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) as HeLa cells in which HIF- 1a had been knocked down were more cytotoxic following 2-DG treatment compared to control cells [101]. Moreover, regulation of glycolysis is also critical in the lactating normal mammary gland, a time of a coordinated upregulation of glycolytic enzyme activity due to the increased demands for energy to produce and secrete milk [102]. For example, the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity increases from 52,500 mUnits/g wet weight in pregnant mice to 81,400 mU/g wet weight in lactating mice, and the activity of pyruvate kinase (PK) increases from 43,500 to 102,000 mU/g, respectively [102]. 1.7 HIF-1a and Metastasis Metastasis is the primary cause of death for breast cancer patients. A large body of evidence supports the hypothesis that hypoxia, in general, and HIF-1a specifically, plays a critical role in cancer metastasis, as reviewed in [103]. For example, as discussed, HIF-1a has been found to be over-expressed in a high percentage of metastatic lesions from the breast [6], HIF-1a over-expression correlates with decreased disease-free survival and is an independent marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [8, 12], and in orthotopic animal model of breast cancer, deletion of HIF-1a strongly impairs metastasis to the lung [65]. 532 T.N. Seagroves In addition, it is of note that HIF-1a was found to be significantly upregulated in a screen of breast cancer patients that had bone marrow (BM) micrometas- tases compared to BM-metastases negative patients [104]. The presence of disseminated breast cancer cells in the BM of patients has been shown pre- viously to predict unfavorable outcome [105]. 1.7.1 HIF-1a Targets Are Key Mediators of Metastasis Some of the genes that have been connected to HIF-1a that regulate breast cancer metastasis include the ligand/chemokine receptor CXCL12 (SDF-1)/ CXCR4, lysyl oxidase (LOX), Twist, Snail, and osteopontin (Spp1). The CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway is a critical regulator of breast cancer cell metasta- sis, as reviewed in [106]. The CXCR4 receptor is expressed by breast cancer cells and corresponding metastases, whereas high levels of CXCL12/SDF-1 are found in organs that are common sites of breast metastasis, including the lymph nodes, bone, lung, and liver [107]. Activation of CXCR4 in response to exposure to CXCL12/SDF-1 also increases breast cancer cell motility and invasion, whereas over-expression of CXCR4 in breast tumor cells increases lung and bone metastases in vivo and downregulation of CXCR4 decreases metastasis[106]. The breast tumor stroma also expresses CXCL12. In fact, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) expressing CXCL12 have been shown to participate in recruitment of endothelial progenitors from the circula- tion to the primary tumor [108]. Both CXCR4 and CXCL12/SDF-1 are induced by hypoxic exposure and are direct-HIF-1a transcriptional target genes [109, 110]. Moreover, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is a key player in stem cell homing to target tissues as well as maintenance of the stem cell niche since CXCR4 is expressed by many embryonic and adult stem cells that either migrate toward an SDF-1 signal or remain in their respective niche due to high expression of SDF-1, as occurs in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow [111]. Finally, inhibitors to CXCR4, originally developed to target HIV-1 infection, have shown promise in blocking metastasis in animal models of breast cancer [112, 113]. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a catalytic extracellular matrix remodeling enzyme that was found in vitro to be upregulated at the mRNA level in invasive breast cancer cell lines and to be upregulated in invasive breast cancer cells relative to primary tumors [114]. LOX has also been shown to be a direct HIF-1a transcriptional target [115]. Furthermore, breast cancer patients with high LOX-expressing tumors have poor survival, and secreted LOX has been found to be a key player in hypoxia-induced metastasis since blocking LOX expression in MDA-MB-231 cells using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly reduced the numberofmetastasestothe lung follow- ing orthotopic injection of tumor cells into the mammary fat pads of nude mice [116]. Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 533 1.7.2 Role of HIF-1a in EMT Acquiring the ability to mobilize to distant sites in the body may be regulated in part by the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in which epithelial cells lose polarity, exhibit a decrease in E-cadherin, and acquire markers of expressed by stromal fibroblasts, such as vimentin, as reviewed in [117]. A key mediator of this pathway is Twist, a basic-helix-loop helix transcription factor that has been shown to promote EMT and to mediate metastasis [118], and is also a direct HIF-1a-regulated gene [119]. Snail, a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, also promotes EMT and invasion and metastasis in multiple cancer types [120] and is regulated by the hypoxic response pathway via the VHL/HIF axis [121]. For example, elevated levels of HIF-1a resulting from loss of VHL in renal cell carcinomas downregulates E-cadherin expression through regulation of Snail and the sphingosine-1-phopsphate receptor sub-type 1 (S1P1) [121]. Interestingly, when Yang et al. knocked down Snail in conjunction with over- expression of Twist or when Lox was knocked down in conjunction with Twist, Twist over-expression could not completely restore migration and invasion, suggesting that Snail, Lox, and Twist may regulate distinct pathways critical for metastasis [119]. Given the direct role of HIF-1a in mediating expression of each of these genes, HIF-1a may influence EMT and metastasis through multi- ple molecular mechanisms. 1.7.3 HIF-1a and Osteopontin Regulation, a Plasma Biomarker of Poor Prognosis Finally, in multiple cell types, hypoxia induces expression of secreted phospho- protein 1 (Spp1), also known as osteopontin, (OPN) [122, 123], which is believed to be indirect since no functional HREs have been confirmed to exist in the OPN promoter. OPN is a glycoprotein highly expressed in multiple cell types, including immune cells and osteocytes of the bone, as reviewed in [124]. OPN is also over- expressed in a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, as well as the infiltrating inflammatory immune cells present in cancers [124]. Expression of OPN by tumor cells, or high levels of circulating OPN, correlates with a poor prognosis in head and neck cancer and breast cancer patients [124]. Moreover, studies of mice xenografted with MDA-MB-231 cells via intracardiac injection that had formed osteolytic lesions and were further selected in vivo for bone metastasis, identified both CXCR4 and OPN as highly enriched in 231 cells with high rates of metastasis to bone [125]. More recently, work from the Weinberg laboratory has elegantly demonstrated that secretion of OPN by subcutaneous implantation of ‘‘instigator,’’ or tumorigenic, invasive human breast tumor cells (BPLER or MDA-MB-231) into mice promoted growth and metastasis of normally weakly tumorigenic breast cancer cells (the ‘‘indolent’’ or responder cells, human mam- mary epithelial cell line with hygro-H-rasV12, HMLER-HR) [126]. OPN secreted by the instigating primary tumor was shown to activate the bone marrow and to then mobilize mesenchymal precursor cells into circulation, which resulted in 534 T.N. Seagroves induction of rapid growth of the HMLER-HR cells into large tumors. In addi- tion, knockdown of OPN in the instigator population completely blocked for- mation of lung macrometastases. Although the influence of tissue hypoxia was not investigated in these studies, it is of note that HSCs reside in the most hypoxic regions of the bone and that hypoxia has been recently implicated in recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow to sites of tissue injury [127] and in regulation of stem cell biology, which will be discussed in detail in the following section. 1.8 Hypoxia, HIF-1, and Cancer Stem Cells 1.8.1 Impact of Hypoxia/HIF-1 on Cancer Stem Cells The HIF-1 pathway has been proposed to impose a stem cell (SC) identity on more differentiated transformed cells [16]. This complements popular theory that tumors contain a rare fraction of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which have been defined as similar to normal SCs in that they can (1) self-renew, (2) form tumors upon serial transplantation into host mice, and (3) recapitulate the phenotype of the parental cancer [128]. CSCs were first described in acute myeloid leuke- mia using antibodies to specific cell surface markers and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), which isolated a small fraction of cells capable of self- renewal and tumor formation when transplanted to the bone marrow of immu- nocompromised mice [129]. By using a similar strategy, a population of tumor- initiating cells (TICs) has also been identified from a variety of solid tumors, including breast cancer [130]. The characterization of breast TICs or CSCs, and the genes and pathways that control their self-renewal, survival, and expansion is essential in order to design therapies that preferentially target the relatively rare fraction of CSCs present in a breast tumor. This is particularly true in light of increasing evidence that suggests that the CSC population represents the fraction of tumor cells resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, as reviewed in [131, 132]. To date, the specific contribution of hypoxia, generally, or HIF-1a specifically, to tumor-initiating ability (TIA) and CSC self-renewal and during breast tumor progression or to chemotherapy resistance mediated by CSCs remains largely undefined. 1.8.2 Connections Between Hypoxia, HIF, and Cancer Stem Cell Behavior There are several connections between hypoxia and control of normal stem cell biology. For example, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are enriched in hypoxic regions of bone [133], expansion of HSCs ex vivo is more efficient under hypoxic conditions [134], and neurosphere formation is also enhanced at 3% O2 [135]. In addition, it has been suggested that CSCs exist in a hypoxic environment and that hypoxia stimulates expansion of CSCs, as reviewed in [16]. For example, the local microenvironment of the stem cell niche may influence the ability of CSCs to Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 535 metastasize [136] and also likely strongly impacts therapeutic response [14, 132]. It has been recently reported that most of the tumor cells detected in the bone marrow of breast cancer patients have a stem cell phenotype, which suggests there is selective pressure for their dissemination [137]. Of additional interest, two of the four genes (Klf4, Sox2, Oct-4,and c-Myc)recently demonstrated to convert normal murine fibroblasts to cells with embryonic stem cell activity, Oct-4 and c-Myc, are modulated directly by the HIFa subunits, reviewed in [16]. 1.8.3 Overview of Profiling for Breast Cancer Stem Cells Several laboratories have purified and characterized putative normal SCs and breast CSCs using cell surface markers in which bone marrow lineage-depleted (Lin-) mammary epithelial cells are sorted for sub-populations that express cell surface markers that then correlate with self-renewal, regeneration, and/or TIA. However, there is still controversy regarding whether breast CSCs may express different cell surface markers than normal breast SCs, whether the same markers that are described for human samples will also define SCs in a mouse mammary gland, and whether CSC markers may vary among tumors arising from different tissues types. For example, in human breast cancer samples, Al-Hajj et al. found that, in eight of nine patients, the CD44+/CD24-/low sub- population of cells of breast tumors had high TIA in nude mice [138]. In contrast, in the normal gland, single b1-integrin (CD29)hi/CD24+ cells are able to reconstitute an entire functional mammary gland [139]. More recent studies in transgenic murine models of breast cancer have shown that in the p53 null mammary tumor model, the CD29+/CD24+ population defines the popu- lation with enriched TIA. TIA was not observed in CD24+/CD29\u0003 population, which constituted the bulk of tumor cells, or with CD44+ tumor cells [140]. b3-integrin (CD61) has also been shown in the normal mammary gland to define the more committed ‘‘luminal’’ progenitor population that is responsive to Gata-3; when Gata-3 was deleted, an increase in CD61+ luminal progenitor cells is observed [141]. Similarly, enriched TIA was recently described for the CD61 + population of tumor cells in the MMTV-Wnt1 and p53+/- mouse tumor models of breast cancer, although this population did not define TIA in the more well-differentiated MMTV-Neu tumor model [19]. In contrast, in the MMTV- Neu model, the CD24 + and stem cell antigen (Sca-1) +/CD24 + populations have enriched TIA [18]. And, in MMTV-PyMT tumors [63], the CD24 +/CD29 + or CD29 +/CD61 + sub-populations were increasingly enriched during the course of tumor progression from a hyperplasia to early to late carcinomas [17]. Finally, use of CD133 (Prominin-1) as a surface marker of TICs has been well described for brain, prostate, and colon cancers [142]. In Brca1 null breast tumor cells, the CD133 + sub-population defined the cell population with enhanced TIA [20]. Although there is controversy regarding whether CD133+ is a stable CSC marker [143], or whether changes in CD133 are merely related to the cell cycle [144], it is of heightened interest that CD133 was recently described to be a hypoxia-inducible, oxygen-responsive gene [145]. 536 T.N. Seagroves 1.8.4 Relevance of Notch and Wnt/b -Catenin Pathways in Stem Cell Biology The Notch and canonical Wnt pathways are known regulators of HSCs, and Notch is required for Wnt to maintain undifferentiated HSCs [146]. The Notch and Wnt pathways also cross talk during tumorigenesis [147]. As reviewed in [148], Notch receptors (Notch-1-4 in mammals) undergo a series of proteolytic cleavages in response to activation by DSL [Delta, Serrate (Jagged in mam- mals), and Lag-2] ligands presented by neighboring cells. This leads to translo- cation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to the nucleus, where it interacts with the DNA-binding protein CSL (also known as RBP-Jk or CBF-1, or Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] in Drosophila). In the canonical Wnt pathway, in the absence of Wnt ligand, b-catenin is degraded by the proteosome following its phosphorylation by the kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3b. In the presence of ligand, GSK3-b activity is repressed, allowing b-catenin accumulation, and its binding to the LEF/TCF family of transcription factors to upregulate Wnt target genes, including c-Myc, which has been shown to interface with HIF-1a to regulate cellular metabolism [149]. 1.8.5 Interactions Between NOTCH, HIF-1a, and FIH-1 in Cancer Cells There are several lines of evidence that the Notch pathway is a key player in breast CSC biology. Aberrant Notch activation transforms human breast and murine MECs and mammary stem cells are enriched for Notch activity (reviewed in [150]). In addition, elevated Notch1 and Jagged-1 mRNA levels correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [151] and Notch-4 promotes self-renewal of mammary stem cells [152], Notch-3 is upregulated 3- fold in normal breast cells grown as mammospheres in suspension culture [153], and over-expression of the Notch-3 ICD in transgenic mice causes precocious alveolar development in pregnancy and produces mammary tumors [154]. Furthermore, it has been shown that when MS isolated from the normal human breast are exposed to hypoxia, expression of Shc [p66Shc [155]] increases, which is required to induce Notch-3 and that blocking Notch-3 using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) reduces both primary and secondary MS formation as well as the expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) [156]. Of note, CAIX is direct HIF-1a target gene for which expression negatively corre- lates with disease-free survival in breast cancer patients [9]. Observations in P19 neuronal stem cells and C2C12 myogenic cells that hypoxia increases the transcriptional activity of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD), increases N1ICD expression and that HIF-1a and N1ICD physically interact to mediate repression of differentiation [157] have directly connected HIF-1a to the Notch pathway. Hypoxia potentiates Notch signaling in multiple tumor cell lines, leading to increased transcriptional expression of several Notch target genes, including Hey1,as well as Delta-like 1 (Dll1), a Notch ligand [115]. There are also connections between the hypoxia/Notch and the epithelial–me- senchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. In SKVO-3 ovarian carcinoma cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, hypoxia promoted EMT [115]. Transient Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 537 expression of the N1ICD in SKVO-3 cells promotes tumor cell invasion and migration through Notch-dependent upregulation of Snail.Furthermore, HIF- 1a was recruited to the Snail promoter only under stimulation from both hypoxia and Notch ligand [115]. In addition, FIH-1 has recently been shown to hydro- xylate the ankryin (Ank) 1–7 repeat of the NICD in Notch-1, Notch-2, and Notch-3, but not Notch-4, resulting in decreased Notch transactivation and acceleration of myogenic and neuronal differentiation in C2C12 and P19 cells [158]. Recent studies have suggested that ER-negative, but not ERa+, breast can- cers become ‘‘addicted’’ to Notch signaling through upregulation of survivin, which leads to therapeutic resistance [159]. In addition, expression of cytoplasmic FIH-1 has been reported to be an independent factor that negatively correlates with disease-free survival in invasive breast cancer patients, whereas nuclear expression of FIH-1 correlated with decreased tumor grade and recurrence [160]. As FIH-1 directly represses both HIF-1a and Notch transcriptional activ- ity, it may be an attractive candidate for targeting the eradication of breast CSCs. 1.8.6 The Wnt/b -Catenin Pathway in Breast Cancer and Interactions Between HIF-1a and b -Catenin in Hypoxic Cancer Cells Direct connections between HIF-1a and the Wnt/b-catenin pathway in the breast are less well defined, although it has been clear for some time that dysregulation of the Wnt pathway leads to breast cancer. For example, trans- genic MMTV-Wnt-1 and MMTV-DN89b-catenin (a stabilized b-catenin) mice develop mammary hyperplasias/tumors [161]. In addition, mammary tumors that originate in either MMTV-Wnt-1 or MMTV-Myc mice contain an expan- sion of MECs that express Sca-1, whereas this is not observed in MMTV-Neu tumors [162]. In contrast, when a dominant-negative chimera of b-catenin known as b-engrailed is expressed in the mammary gland, which suppresses b-catenin signaling without affecting cell–cell adhesion, cell survival of lobu- loalveolar progenitors is decreased [163]. Finally, when murine preneoplastic COMMA-D b-geo cells are engineered to express a stabilized version of b-catenin, there is an enrichment of MS formation efficiency (MSFE), whereas expression of b-engrailed repressed MSFE [22]. It has been shown in HepG2 and renal carcinoma cells that GSK3b directly phosphorylates HIF-1a on three Ser/Thr residues, leading to its degradation by the proteosome independent of VHL [164]. In contrast, hypoxic exposure blocked GSK-3b activity, permitting HIF-1a to accumulate as well as presumably b-catenin. Direct physical inter- actions between b-catenin and HIF-1a proteins were also recently observed in colon carcinoma cells only under hypoxic stress [165]. VHL also plays a direct role in downregulation of b-catenin stability through its interaction with a previously identified VHL-interacting protein, Jade-1. Chitalia et al. found that Jade-1 func- tioned as a single subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targeted both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated b-catenin for proteolytic degradation, thereby establish- ing a pathway in which VHL can repress Wnt-on or Wnt-off signaling [166]. 538 T.N. Seagroves 2 HIF-1 and Therapeutic Resistance in Breast Cancer A direct role for HIF-1a in mediating resistance to radiation and chemotherapy has been confirmed in a variety of cell types since downregulation of HIF-1a at least partially restored sensitivity to therapy [167–173]. If one accepts the CSC concept as highly relevant to cancer control and that HIF-1a is a key regulator of CSC behavior, then the HIF-1 pathway must be critical for the survival of the CSCs after radiation or chemotherapy. If this relationship could be firmly established, it would have a significant impact on breast cancer clinical out- comes since it is believed that the CSCs remaining post-therapy are the fraction capable of tumor cell regeneration. 2.1 HIF-1a and Radiation Resistance Elegant studies by Moeller et al. in the Balb/C-derived 4T1 murine mammary cancer model have demonstrated that HIF-1a promotes tumor radioresistance in part by upregulating expression of VEGF and bFGF during the period of re- oxygenation following single-dose irradiation, stabilizing the tumor vasculature [174]. However, animal studies such as these may not reflect what is observed in the clinic since most patients receive fractionated irradiation, in which radiotherapy is provided in multiple doses over a course of a few weeks. It has been shown that immediately after a large, single dose of IR, most of the cells in a tumor will be hypoxic, but after several hours of recovery, previously hypoxic regions of tumors can be re-oxygenated [13]. This type of intermittent hypoxia has been shown to enhance the survival of the tumor endothelial cells in a HIF-1a-dependent manner in a liver xenograft mouse model [175]. In head and neck cancers, the level of pimonidazole binding (which detects tissue hypoxia) has been shown to correlate with the ability to predict treatment outcome [176], although similar studies failed to find the same relationship between the staining for CAIX and the ability to predict outcome [177]. An excellent review that clearly outlines the potential role of CSCs in radioresistance has been recently published [178]. Using FACS-based methods to sort for breast tumor cells with enriched CSC activity, studies have shown that the breast CSC population for a particular cell line is more radioresistant than its parental cell line. For example, MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231 cells that were enriched for a CD24\u0003/lo/CD44+ profile and grown as mammospheres were more radioresistant than parental monolayer- cultured cells [179]. In MCF-7 cells exposed to increasing doses of IR, the Sca- 1+ and CD24+/CD29+ sub-populations increased, whereas the Sca-1\u0003 or CD24\u0003/CD29\u0003 population decreased. There were increases in gH2AX, a marker of DNA damage in the Sca1\u0003 versus the Sca-1+ population [23]. Independent studies have shown in normal MECs that the Sca-1+ progenitor population is highly resistant to radiation, that Sca-1+ cells contain less DNA damage than Sca1\u0003 cells, and that active b-catenin mediates self-renewal of Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 539 Sca-1+ cells, possibly through induction of survivin [22]. By testing for the role of HIF-1a versus HIF-2a in these model systems using stable-hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown, or by using genetic models of HIFa subunit deletion, it will be possible to test for a direct role of HIF-1 or HIF-2 in mediating radiation resistance in CSCs. In order to maintain the pertinent microenvironment and to preserve the potentially hypoxic CSC niche in vivo, these studies should also be conducted in transgenic models of breast cancer, which develop spontaneous tumors,which arethensubjectedtoradiation therapy at particular stages of tumor progression. 2.2 HIF-1a and Chemotherapy Resistance There are several mechanisms by which hypoxia, and thereby HIF-1a expres- sion, within solid tumors may regulate resistance to chemotherapy [14]. First, the limited and disorganized vasculature in tumors results in poor perfusion and delivery of nutrients, which could lead to reduced proliferation in hypoxic regions, and therefore, poor clinical response, since most chemotherapeutic agents are most effective in highly proliferating cells. Second, it has been proposed that doxorubicin (DOX) relies on generation of superoxide from oxygen for cytotoxicity [180], therefore DOX would be expected to be less effective in hypoxic regions of tumors. HIF-1a has also been shown to regulate expression of two proteins that control drug efflux, the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) [167] and the ABC transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) [181]. Of note, ABCG2 effluxes Hoechst 33342 dye, which has been used to enrich the ‘‘side-population’’ of cells with stem-like features in multiple tissues, including the breast [182, 183]. 2.3 HIF-1a and the Estrogen Receptor Interestingly, hypoxic exposure downregulates estrogen receptor (ER)a protein through HIF-1-dependent proteolytic degradation, suggesting that hypoxia may contribute to tamoxifen resistance [15, 184]. Several recent studies have noted an association between HIF-1a and decreased expression of ERa in breast tumors [184–186]. This is an important finding since ERa-negative tumors are associated with an increase risk of progression to metastasis and ERa is reduced in the majority of tamoxifen-resistant tumors [187]. Because ERa represses up to 70% of its 400 target genes in MCF-7 cells [188], it is possible that HIF-1a may function to relieve repression of a subset of ERa targets in the breast. They may be cancer-associated candidate genes that are co-regulated by HIF-1a and ERa that could be exploited in the future to treat breast cancer patients. 540 T.N. Seagroves 3 Therapeutic Strategies That Modulate HIF-1a 3.1 Overview of HIF-1a Inhibitors Several reviews have highlighted the benefit of targeting tumor hypoxia, generally, and the HIF-1 pathway, specifically, in treating solid tumors [13, 77, 189]. There- fore, I will focus on those pathways and inhibitors that have been tested in vitro in breast cancer cell lines, that have been tested for efficacy in animal models of cancer, or that have been used successfullyinclinicaltrialstotreat solidtumors. 3.1.1 Inhibitors of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway As discussed previously, constitutive RTK activation and/or the downstream PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway can stabilize HIF-1a independent of oxygen and result in upregulation of HIF-1a target genes, such as VEGF. Therefore, it is not surprising that various inhibitors of these pathways have been shown to result in decreased HIF-1a expression and transcriptional activity. For exam- ple, treatment of cancer cells with small molecule inhibitors of EGFR, such as gefitinib (Iressa) or erlotinib (Tarceva), or with monoclonal-antibody based therapy, such as cetuximab/C225, reduces HIF-1a expression [74, 190]. Inhibi- tors of mTOR also reduce HIF-1a synthesis and therefore, transcriptional activity. For example, rapamycin (sirolimus), temsirolimus, and everolimus/ RAD-001 can each reduce tumor growth, in part through reducing VEGF- dependent tumor angiogenesis [191]. Rapamycin treatment of transgenic MMTV-Neu female mice resulted in decreased tumor progression through decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, albeit without sig- nificant changes in MVD [192]. In MDA-MB-231 cells, when RAD-001 was combined with radiation therapy, this strategy enhanced reduction in colony formation post-irradiation, although the effect on HIF-1a expression was not evaluated in this study [193]. The inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 also resulted in decreased HIF-1a expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines [194]. Currently, there are several pending clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of combinatorial therapies targeting various RTK-activated pathways in treat- ing metastatic and inflammatory breast cancer [195]. The rationale for these types of trials is supported by pre-clinical studies that have shown that therapies combining anti-EGFR family inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors are synergistic in killing MDA-MB-468 cultured cells and Calu6 non-small cell lung cancer tumors in the xenograft setting [196]. With respect to breast cancer, treatment of transgenic mice with MMTV-Neu mammary tumors with rapamycin and Herceptin (trastuzumab), which targets HER2 receptors, is also synergistic, resulting in enhanced tumor apoptosis [197]. It also should be considered that at least part of the therapeutic response may be due to the repression of HIF-1a and its downstream target genes. Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 541 3.1.2 DNA Modification Inhibitors It is becoming increasingly appreciated that tissue hypoxia represents a potent epigenetic modifier to regulate gene expression in tumors [198]. Various histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown to reduce HIF-1a expression and tumor angiogenesis, likely due to the ability of HIF-1a to physically interact with various HDAC enzymes [199]. For example, HDAC inhibitors FK228 and LAQ824 have been shown to inhibit HIF-1a protein accumulation and transcrip- tional activation in Lewis lung carcinoma and renal carcinoma cells [200, 201]. Topotecan (TPT) is a molecule discovered in a HIF-1-targeted high- throughput screen of the NCI Diversity Set and is a topoisomerase I inhibitor. TPT acts by inhibiting the hypoxic induction of HIF-1a protein and interferes with its ability to bind DNA [202]. However, in a phase I/II clinical study of patients with metastatic breast cancer, TPT therapy was found to have limited efficacy and deemed not appropriate as a first-line therapy for breast can- cer[203]. Several clinical trials are currently recruiting women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer to test efficacy of these types of inhibitors in combination therapy [195]. 3.1.3 Inhibitors of Hsp90 Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone over-expressed in multiple cancers that has multiple signal transduction proteins as substrates for stabilization, folding, and maturation including ERBB2, Akt, and HIF-1a [204]. Therefore, although HSP90 inhibitors are not specific to a particular pathway, they are advantageous for killing tumor cells in that they are capable of blocking multiple, signaling pathways in the cell that are often nodes for signaling cross talk. In addition, it has been demonstrated by comparison of normal and tumor cells of breast and colon cancer that the HSP90 inhibitor 17- allylamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG), a derivative of geldanamy- cin, preferentially targets tumor cells since in tumor cells, HSP90 is found in multiprotein complexes with high ATPase activity, whereas HSP90 in normal cells is uncomplexed [205]. The ability of the 17-AAG to interact with HIF-1a and then target it for proteosomal degradation independent of oxygen or VHL[206] has been found to be dependent upon interactions with receptor of activated protein C kinase (RACK1) [207]. 17-AAG has been tested in phase I clinical trials in patients with progres- sive solid tumor malignancies, with hepatotoxicity as the primary dose-limit- ing factor [208]. In addition, there is a lot of excitement regarding the ability of Hsp90 inhibitors to suppress the ability of breast cancer cells to develop resistance to small molecules TKIs [209], particularly in women with HER2+ breast cancers [210]. Several clinical trials are in the recruitment phase to test the ability of 17-AAG in combination therapies to treat locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer [195]. Novel synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors that are more bioavailable, such as SNX-2112, or its prodrug SNX-5542, have also been 542 T.N. Seagroves developed and shown in cultured cells as well as xenografted tumor models to have potent inhibition of Hsp90 at least equivalent to 17-AAG [211]. A Phase I clinical trial is in the recruitment phase to test the safety and maximum tolerated dose of SNX-5542 in refractory lymphoma or in patients with solid tumors [195]. 3.1.4 Other Small Molecule HIF Inhibitors YC-1, 3-(5 0-hydroxymethyl-2 0-furyl)-1-benzylindazole, a soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulator, has been shown in several xenograft cancer models to inhibit HIF-1a protein expression and to have anti-angiogenic activity [212]. In addition, in an animal model of metastasis, YC-1 treatment dramatically reduced cell migration and metastatic burden [213]. Likewise, YC-1 treatment has been shown to decrease bone metastases derived from MDA-MD-231 breast cancer cells that were introduced into animals by intracardiac injection [214]. YC-1 was recently reported in a human lung cancer cell line to also reduce cell proliferation to block activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and to reduce cyclin D1 expression [215]. However, to date no clinical trials using YC-1 have been initiated. Another small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1a that hasalsobeen shownto have potent antitumor activity is PX-478 (S-2-amino-3-[40-N,N,-bis(chlor- oethyl)amino]phenyl propionic acid N-oxide dihydrochloride) [216]. The primary mechanism of action of PX-478 is to block translation-dependent accumulation of HIF-1a independent of VHL in addition to decreasing HIF-1a mRNA levels and reducing deubiquitination[217]. A phase I trial is in recruitment to test PX-478 safety in patients with a secondary focus of evaluating its impact on the HIF-1a pathway [195]. Olenyuk et al. have developed a novel approach to HIF inhibition through the rationale development and characterization of DNA sequence-specific synthetic, cell-permeable polyamides [218]. The strategy for blocking HIF-1a-mediated tran- scriptional regulation was based on a FITC-conjugated polyamide that blocked HIF-a/HIF-1b from binding to the HRE located at \u0003947 to \u0003939 of the VEGF promoter (polyamide 1) [219]. It later demonstrated that whereas delivery of siRNA to HIF-1a or treatment with the HIF inhibitor echinomycin, a DNA- binding natural product, modulated nearly every known target gene of the HIF-1 pathway, that polyamide 1 was more restricted in its regulation of the HIF-1 response [220]. 3.1.5 Glycolytic Inhibitors Because of the HIF-1a-dependent Warburg effect observed in tumors, inhibi- tion of the glycolytic pathway, which has been proposed in the literature for decades [221], is an attractive therapeutic approach. Clinical studies in glioma patients have shown that administration of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) was well tolerated in combination with radiotherapy [222]. In animal models, some groups have reported a synergy of 2DG with chemotherapy or radiation and Complexity of the HIF-1-Dependent Hypoxic Response in Breast Cancer 543 others have reported that 2DG reduced therapeutic effect. For example, in an animal model of pancreatic cancer, combination of 2DG with radiotherapy sensitized tumor cells to radiation [223] and 2DG in combination with cisplatin- enhanced therapeutic response in cultured FaDu head and neck cancer cells [224]. In contrast, in human monocytic leukemia U937 cells, 2DG blocked etopo- side-induced apoptosis [225]. In addition, in pancreatic cancer cells, combining geldanamycin and the hexokinase II inhibitor 3-broma-pyruvate (3BrPA) was synergistic in reducing xenograft tumor growth [21]. Currently, two clinical trials are recruiting patients with advanced solid tumors or prostate cancer to evaluate 2DG as safe therapy for these patients. In addition, several prospective clinical trials are ongoing in which 18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18 FDG)-based PTE scan- ning will be used to evaluate tumor metabolism as a key future clinical parameter in refining treatment of a variety of tumor types, including breast cancer [195]. 3.2 Limitations of Current Anti-HIF Therapies Key limitations of current anti-HIF therapies are that they do not exclusively inhibit HIF-1 and the likelihood that, given the high number of genes that HIF- 1 regulates, there will be adverse side effects in normal cells. Moreover, HIF-1a not only activates but also represses target genes. And, the magnitude of HIF- 1-dependent regulation is highly cell specific. As an example, HIF-1a induces expression of pro-survival genes as well as genes that are pro-apoptotic, there- fore the overall microenvironment context will be important for pushing tumor cells to decide between survival and death. In addition, since HIF-1a can be stabilized under normoxic conditions due to activation of oncogenes, activation of RTKs or deletion of tumor suppressors such as VHL, strategies that do not solely rely on the presence of hypoxia for blocking HIF-1a transcriptional activity must also be considered. 4 Summary: Challenges for the Future The major challenge in applying new anti-HIF clinical regimens that will improve breast cancer patient survival is how to select for patients that will best respond to HIF inhibitors. For example, it is reasonable that patients with a HIF hypoxic response signature score [3] or that have tumors with a large hypoxic fraction or that have elevated glucose metabolism detected by 18 FDG imaging will benefit most from anti-HIF strategies. In addition, as new combinatorial approaches are evaluated in clinical trials that include pathway inhibitors to target the HIFa subunits, it will be critical to consider which therapies will best synergize with anti-HIF therapies and in what order they should be administered to patients. For example, the Dewhirst laboratory has demonstrated using colon HT116 xenografts that ‘‘radiation-first’’ strategies were most effective compared to ‘‘anti-HIF-first’’ approaches in combination therapy [168] and that the combined 544 T.N. Seagroves therapy was highly synergistic. This observation was explained in part due to the destabilization of the tumor vasculature in response to HIF-1a deletion. As another example, in a xenograft study of HeLa cells that expressed a pro- caspase3 construct under control of the HIF ODD delivered systemically through the protein-transduction domain of HIV-1 tat protein (TOP3 model), tumors from mice that had received combination therapy of ionizing radiation and TOP3 had synergistically reduced decreased tumor volume. In contrast, treatment with TOP3 alone only temporarily reduced tumor growth [226]. Another challenge in breast cancer treatment is to block metastasis. Since accumulating data strongly suggest that HIF-1a may regulate a metastatic switch in breast cancer by promoting EMT, cell invasion, homing, and coloni- zation, screens for compounds that limit HIF-1a-dependent steps of metastasis could have significant clinical impact. As reviewed in [227], a focus on blocking metastatic spread could perhaps be the most clinically relevant approach to cure breast cancer. One way screening for efficacy of novel anti-HIF compounds that are also dependent on HIFa function could be accomplished is to subject cultured breast cancer cells, in which HIF-1a or HIF-2a is over-expressed (compared to the parental cell line), to high-throughput cell invasion assays in the presence or absence of drug. Drugs that block invasion in a HIFa-dependent manner could then be tested in pre-clinical transgenic or xenografted animal models in which breast cancer cells are known to metastasize. Some of the systems that could be utilized include mammary tumor cells derived from the PyMT mouse, which our laboratory is developing, the murine 4T1 transplant system or by xenografting MDA-MB-231 cells into the cleared mammary fat pad. In addi- tion, to quantitate the effect of novel HIF inhibitors on primary tumor growth and metastasis, the routine use of bio-imaging modalities in mice over the course of the experiment, such as with the Xenogen bio-imaging system, will facilitate observation of the potency of HIF inhibitors on these processes. In addition, if cells are first dually labeled with both a fluorophore and a luciferase reporter, then it would also be possible to determine if the mammary tumor cells are still alive (fluorophore+; luciferase+), or if a therapy has killed the tumor cells (fluorophore+ only). This is because activity of luciferase, visualized by injection of D-luciferin into the animal, depends on ATP production, which would only occur in live cells, whereas a fluorophore signal may still be detected if the dead cells have not yet been cleared by the host, as in the case of necrotic areas. In conclusion, there are multiple avenues by which anti-HIF therapies may be beneficial to breast cancer patients. A more complete understanding of the role that HIF-1a plays in the various cell types that are involved in breast cancer progression and metastasis, in addition to fine dissection of the HIF-1a-regu- lated downstream pathways that may be preferentially up- or downregulated during specific stages of progression and metastasis, will be key to further refining therapies. The ultimate goal of such studies would be to tailor ther- apeutics to those breast cancer patients that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic regimens designed to block HIF-1a activity.

Tang 1 Introduction Over the last decade, anti-cancer therapies (chemotherapy and radiation, hormonal, neoadjuvant, and combinatorial therapies) have prolonged the lives of cancer patients. However, present cancer therapies fail in a high percentage of cases due to an incomplete elimination of the tumor cells, resulting in relapse and metastasis of the tumor. The vast majority of can- cer-related deaths are due to metastatic tumor growth that impairs the func- tion of vital organ(s). Thus, cancer relapse and metastasis are the major challenges in fighting cancer. Metastasis is an inefficient process in that <1% of the disseminated cancer cells are able to form clinically relevant macrometastases [1]. At present, this inefficiency is mostly explained in terms of the need for cancer cells to find the proper microenvironment. However, a hypothesis used to explain tumor forma- tion, i.e., the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, might provide an alternative explanation for this inefficiency [2–5]. Application of the CSC hypothesis to metastasis suggests that this rare subset of cells within a primary tumor that are capable of re-initiating growth and forming metastasis in distant sites may in fact be CSCs. Cancer relapse and metastasis often appear in patients after apparent successful initial therapy and recovery or after a long disease-free period. In some cases, the disease-free period is termed as ‘‘cancer dormancy,’’ which is defined as the long latency period that occurs in some patients between initial treatment and clinical evidence of relapse and metastasis [6]. Clinically, cancer dormancy may be one of the major reasons of tumor recurrence and metastasis. D.G.

One is cancer mass dormancy in which some tumor cells proliferate while others undergo apoptosis, resulting in a clinically undetectable tumor mass for a long time [7, 8]. The other mechanism is attributable to the residual cancer cells that have undergone cell-cycle arrest, quiescence, or cell dormancy [9]. Nor- mal adult stem cells (SCs) generally proliferate slowly and are even kept quiescent (or dormant) in their niche but can be ‘‘awaken’’ to contribute to tissue regeneration [10–12]. CSCs, responsible for initiating tumor and maintaining tumor homeostasis, might be endowed with some properties of their normal counterparts [13, 14]. That is to say, CSCs may also pro- liferate slowly or are kept quiescent in their niche although solid data are still absent. Collectively, CSCs may be the culprits of cancer dormancy that leads to relapse and metastasis. In this chapter, we review the current definition of CSCs and several methods that can be used to prospectively identify putative CSCs and study their niche requirement. Then we present traditional view of chemoresistance and review newly emerged evidence that CSCs may be naturally resistant to therapy. Finally, novel potential therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs and their niches are introduced. 2 Cancer Stem Cells 2.1 Definition In 1937, Furth and Kahn provided the first quantitative assessment of the frequency of the malignant cells in leukemia cell lines that could maintain the hematopoietic tumor in mice and the results indicated that not all of the cells could initiate tumor. Thus, the CSC principle was first introduced. Several studies in 1960s and 1970s elegantly showed the functional heterogeneity in tumors in that only a small subset of tumor cells can re-initiate tumor in vivo, and these studies officially introduced the CSC concept [15–18]. Studies in leukemia first provided compelling evidence for the existence of a putative CSC subpopulation or a hierarchical model of cancer [19]. By now, putative CSCs have been reported in multiple solid tumors including breast cancer, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer (see Table 1). The observations that leukemic SCs appear to display a similar cell surface phenotype to the normal hematopoietic SCs (HSCs) suggest that CSCs may originate from their normal counterpart [20]. Emerging data show that CSCs may also derive from com- mitted progenitors and even differentiated cells [21–23]. Together, CSCs may derive from stem cells that have acquired tumorigenic capacity or from com- mitted progenitors or even differentiated cells that have acquired self-renewal and tumorigenic properties. 560 H.

Yan et al. How should a CSC be defined? A CSC is a cell within a tumor that possesses the capacity to self-renew and to cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor, and the regenerated tumors can be serially xenotrans- planted [20, 24]. Strictly speaking, none of the CSCs thus far reported can be truly classified as CSCs and should, more appropriately, be called ‘‘tumor- reinitiating cells,’’ ‘‘tumorigenic cells,’’ or ‘‘putative CSCs.’’ In reality, it will be very difficult to identify a tumorigenic cell that can fulfill the strict definition of CSCs mentioned above. First, a tumor, especially a solid tumor, is made of numerous cell types. To expect one cell or even a population of cells, when transplanted into a foreign host (i.e., mice) in an exotic environment, to fully reconstitute an original patient tumor in its complete composition begs tremen- dous imagination and will be essentially impossible to prove. Second, when such experiments are actually done, the best one can do is to co-inject the putative tumorigenic cell population with stromal cells (e.g., fibroblasts) in an extracellular matrix (e.g., matrigel or collagen gel) into an ‘‘orthotopic’’ animal site such as brain, mammary fat pad, or prostate lobes. These so-called ortho- topic sites are considerably different from their human counterparts and tumor establishment would inevitably require the recruitment of various host (i.e., mouse) cells by the tumor-reinitiating cells. One can be certain that such ‘‘reconstituted’’ tumors could never be the same as the original patient tumors. Third, during the purification process, the majority of cells are often discarded to obtain marker-positive and marker-negative populations. These discarded cells would be important in the original tumor composition but they would be very difficult to reconstitute in tumor development assays. Altogether, one can say, at the best, that the experimental tumor reconstituted from the presumptive CSCs histologically ‘‘resembles’’ the patient tumor [24]. 2.2 Identification 2.2.1 Marker-Based Analysis This is the most widely used and also the most practical approach. A variety of adult tissue SCs are found to express relatively specific markers, which can be cell surface or intracellular (e.g., nuclear and cytoskeletal). Interestingly, CSCs seem to express various cell surface markers such as CD44 and/or CD133 that identify their normal counterparts [25], which allows a relatively simple enrichment procedure by utilizing either flow cytometry-based cell sorting or microbeads- based affinity purification. For intracellular markers such as a nuclear or cytoskeletal protein, a gene promoter-driven reporter construct such as GFP- tagged retroviral or lentiviral vector system can be developed to track down and purify putative (cancer) SCs [26]. Alternatively, transgenic animal models can be made by knocking in the gene promoter-driven reporter (GFP, LacZ, etc.) followed by further flow cytometry purification [27]. The disadvantages asso- ciated with using predetermined marker(s) to identify CSCs include that the Cancer Stem Cells 563 marker proteins frequently change during cell development in vivo and cell preparation in vitro and that in many cases the functions of these markers in both normal SCs and stem-like cancer cells are unclear. 2.2.2 Side Population (SP) Analysis Mouse HSCs are found to preferentially express multidrug resistance (MDR) family proteins such as MDR1 and other membrane transporters such as ABCG2 (also called breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)) [28]. This prop- erty allows the HSCs, in an experimental setting, to pump out the Hoechst 33342 dye. Therefore, on dual-wavelength flow cytometry, the CSC-enriched cell population is identified as a side or tail Hoechstdim population at the lower left quadrant of the histogram. By contrast, the major population of cells is displayed as Hoechsthi cells called as non-SP or main population [29, 30]. Recent work reveals that multiple adult tissue SCs can also be enriched by the SP protocol and that the SP from several cancer types are also enriched in stem- like cancer cells [31, 32]. The major advantage of this technique when used to identify putative CSCs is its simplicity and independence of predetermined markers. The potential problems associated with the technique are that chronic accumulation of Hoechst dye in non-SP cells may be cytotoxic (thus invalidat- ing suitable controls) and that SP cells isolated from some normal tissues or tumors seem to be enriched in progenitor cells rather than SCs. 2.2.3 Sphere Formation Assays Many normal SCs such as neural, hematopoietic, and mammary SCs, when maintained under special culture conditions, can form three-dimensional spheres, which are like mini-organs that can differentiate into multiple cell types. Putative CSCs identified in brain and prostate tumors as well as in melanoma also have the ability to form anchorage-independent spheres [24, 33, 34]. The advantage of using sphere-forming assays to enrich for CSC is its initial independence of specific markers. The disadvantages include the empirical nature of finding culture conditions suitable for sphere formation and the necessity of finding ways later to identify and purify the real CSCs from the spheres. 2.2.4 Label-Retaining Properties Mammary SCs and normal keratinocyte SCs in interfollicular epidermis and hair follicle bulges are quiescent and can be identified with a pulse label with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or H2B-GFP followed by a long- term ‘‘chase’’ (i.e., removal of the label). Fast proliferating progenitor cells dilute out the BrdU label after several cell divisions whereas the slow-dividing SCs retain BrdU and are thus identified as ‘‘label-retaining cells (LRCs)’’ by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry analysis [13, 35]. Interestingly, the LRCs in human breast tumors coexpress mammary epithelial SC markers 564 H. Yan et al. and seem to have certain SC properties [36]. Human PCa [37] and nasophar- yngeal carcinomas [38] also possess slow-cycling LRCs. The main challenge of this approach is that the LRCs have to be purified out live to show they indeed represent slow-cycling CSCs, which generally is difficult to do without a suitable genetic-tracking system. Furthermore, recent studies in HSCs suggest that not all LRCs may represent SCs [39]. On the other hand, the authors in this latter study [39] failed to show whether all the cells had been labeled with BrdU when the chase period began, as a very recent study shows that the H2B-GFP strategy labels a higher percentage of cells than using BrdU and that the label-retaining ovarian surface epithelial cells indeed possess certain SC properties [40]. 2.2.5 Clonal Assay The study in primary human keratinocytes has revealed cellular heterogeneity with respect to their ability to form a clone related to different cell sizes – small cells could form clones but large cells would undergo terminal differentiation [41]. Further work has shown that three different types of clones possess different proliferative capacities [42]. The holoclone contains tightly packed small cells with greatest replicative capacity. In contrast, the paraclone is a loosely packed clone of large cells with a short replicative life span. The third type of clone, the meroclone, contains a mixture of cells of different prolifera- tive potential and is a transitional stage between the holoclone and the para- clone [42]. Similar to primary keratinocytes, several head and neck cancer-derived cells can also form three different types of clone in culture [43]. More importantly, the holoclones but not paraclones highly express some stem cell-associated molecules, suggesting that holoclones might contain self-renewing stem-like cells [24, 43]. Our work, in several long-cultured cell lines of prostate, breast, and other cancer cells, confirmed that only a small fraction of cells can form holoclone in culture [24]. Our subsequent study in PC3 cells has revealed that holoclones are enriched for potential CSCs that can initiate serially transplan- table tumors [44]. 2.3 CSC Niche Normal SCs are found to harbor in a specialized microenvironment called the stem cell ‘‘niche’’, which contains capillaries, vascular endothelial cells, peri- cytes, and the fibrous proteins of the extracellular matrix. Other stromal cells, immune cells, and nerves may also be present in the niche [45]. Stimuli from the niche as well as signals from SCs themselves and from outside of niche, together, establish a regulatory network to balance between SC self-renewal and differ- entiation [46]. Under physiological conditions, the niche provides a tight con- trol over proliferation, typically maintaining cells in G0 and/or balancing Cancer Stem Cells 565 proliferation and apoptosis such that the SC population remains at a constant size [13, 47, 48]. Recent investigations in HSCs have uncovered two distinct niches, an osteoblast niche and a vascular niche [49, 50]. Osteoblasts lining the endosteal surface of the bone may function as the ‘‘quiescent or dormant niche’’, whereas the endothelial cells lining the bone marrow (BM) and spleen sinusoids may comprise the ‘‘activated or vascular niche’’ that regulates HSC expansion and differentiation. There has been some controversy over whether or not CSCs actually require specific niches. A recent study indicates that specialized microenvironments of BM (i.e., periendosteal region) seem to be required for the homing and engraft- ment of not only normal HSCs but also leukemic SCs [51]. CD133+ brain CSCs also seem to ‘‘live’’ in a vascular niche that secretes factors that promote their long-term growth and self-renewal [52]. Interestingly, CSCs themselves not only are dependent on factors produced by the vasculature to maintain self-renewal and long-term growth but also generate vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) and other factors to induce angiogenesis to promote vascular forma- tion [52]. Another recent study also reveals that the CD133+ glioma SCs secrete more VEGF to enhance vascular formation compared to bulk cells [53]. In this case, CSCs and angiogenesis can positively feedback each other to promote tumor development and maintenance. Intriguingly, normal SC niches may also be involved in the metastatic process, as tumor cells disseminated from the primary tumor often migrate and seed microanatomical areas characteristically occupied by somatic SCs [46]. Disseminated CSCs might acquire responsiveness to certain secreted niche signals and thus initiate metastasis from these supportive microenviron- ments distant from the site of primary tumor [54]. The tumor microenvironment in a secondary organ may be considered as a ‘‘metastatic niche.’’ It is believed that the metastatic niche either passively supports tumor development or facil- itates tumor formation. It has also been hypothesized that CSCs may remain dormant until activated by ‘‘appropriate’’ signaling from the microenvironment [55, 56]. Taken together, the potential role of the CSC niche in controlling the CSC fate provides some support for the theory that targeting the unique aberrant microenvironment of CSCs may represent a critical aspect of effective cancer therapy. 3 Chemotherapy and Drug Resistance Traditional chemotherapeutic strategies, on the assumption that the majority of the cells within tumor are actively proliferating, have used a variety of drugs and hormonal agents that interfere with the basic cellular machinery (e.g., DNA synthesis and replication, cell cycle, and cytoskeleton) [57]. However, because cancer cells share many properties with their normal counterparts, the serious, sometimes life-threatening, side effects that arise from toxicities to sensitive normal cells limit the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy [58]. Improved under- standing of the molecular alterations present in the cancer cells has enabled the 566 H. Yan et al. development of a more cancer-specific ‘‘targeted therapy’’ for some types of cancer [57]. Such therapeutics aim at selectively targeting proliferating cancer cells and leaving normal cells untouched, thereby reducing the common side effects. Nevertheless, all therapeutics, either targeted or non-targeted, are designed to ablate proliferating cancer cells [58], which may lead to the possi- bility of tumor recurrence or drug resistance due to the presence of quiescent cells or slow-dividing cells in the tumor. Since chemotherapy became one of the main therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment, resistance has often followed. A number of studies indicate that there are three major mechanisms of drug resistance in cells: first, decreased uptake of water-soluble drugs such as folate antagonists, nucleoside analogs, and cispla- tin, which require transporters to enter cells; second, various changes in cells that affect the capacity of cytotoxic drugs to kill cells, including alterations in cell cycle, increased repair of DNA damage, reduced apoptosis, and altered metabolism of drugs; and third, increased energy-dependent efflux of hydro- phobic drugs that can easily enter the cells by diffusion through the plasma membrane [59]. Of these mechanisms, the one that is most commonly encoun- tered is the increased efflux of a broad class of hydrophobic cytotoxic drugs, mediated by energy-dependent transporters, known as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which includes seven subfamilies labeled A–G [60–62]. Interestingly, resistance occurs not only to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs but also to targeted therapeutics such as gefitinib (epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR inhibitor), imatinib (an inhibitor of translocated BCR-ABL kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia), and tamoxifen (targeting the estrogen receptor or ER in breast cancer) [63–65]. How do cancer cells acquire resistance to chemotherapy? Are there cells in the tumor, e.g., quiescent or slow-dividing cells that are naturally resistant to chemotherapy? Or the proliferating cells targeted by anti-cancer drugs acquire genetic changes to be resistant? The CSC hypothesis may bring us new insight on these important questions related to drug resistance. 4 CSCs in Chemoresistance and Radioresistance Based on the CSC hypothesis, CSCs may be naturally resistant to therapeutic agents.First,mostchemodrugs target proliferating cells while CSCs are thought to be generally quiescent; therefore, CSCs will be mostly spared of drugs. Solid experimental data in support of this contention are yet to be provided. Second, the putative CSC niche may protect CSCs from damage during therapeutic treatment. Third, the ABC transporters that pump out drugs are preferentially expressed in CSCs, as described above for the SP cells. Many studies have shown that the SP phenotype is mediated by MDR pro- teins and that the SP tumor cells confer high drug efflux capacity [66–68]. A small population of stem-like cells in small-cell lung carcinoma has also showed coexpression of CD44 and multidrug resistance protein, MDR1, Cancer Stem Cells 567 suggesting that CSCs may be drug-resistant [69]. Furthermore, one recent study indicates that melanoma cells positive for ABCB5 are much more tumorigenic than the corresponding ABCB5\u0002 cells and that ABCB5 actually mediates drug resistance in melanoma, suggesting that the ABCB5+ cells may represent melanoma stem cells [70]. Fourth, chemodrugs often exert their effects by eliciting cancer cell apoptosis, and overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 has been observed in some CSC populations [71]. Indeed, prospectively purified CSCs from human colon cancer specimen are more resistant to apoptosis than bulk cells [72]. Fifth, SCs are also thought to be more resistant to DNA-damaging agents than differentiated cells because of their ability to undergo asynchronous DNA synthesis and the enhanced capacity for DNA repair. During asynchronous DNA synthesis, the parental ‘‘immortal’’ DNA strand always segregates with the new SC rather than with the differentiating progeny, thus helping to protect the SC population from DNA damage [73–75]. Similarly, CSCs seem to be more resistant to DNA- damaging agents [76, 77]. Several lines of evidence indicate that CSCs may be intrinsically drug- resistant. For example, putative CSCs are found to contribute to cisplatin resistance in a Brca1/p53 mutant mouse mammary tumor model [78]. In glioblastoma, the CD133+ CSCs demonstrate significant resistance to che- motherapeutic agents including teozolomide, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and etoposide in vitro [79]. In breast cancer xenografts, after several cycles of administering anti-cancer drugs to mice, the percentage of CD44+CD24\u0002 CSC population increases significantly. Furthermore, these cells exhibit much higher clonogenic and tumorigenic capacity than the parental cells [38]. Importantly, breast CSCs are enriched in breast cancer patients after administering chemotherapy [38]. Besides being ‘‘naturally’’ resistant to therapeutics, some CSCs may also acquire further resistance through accumulating mutations following exposure, producing a population of multidrug-resistant tumor cells that can be found in many cancer patients with recurrent diseases [80]. 5 Novel Cancer Therapies by Targeting CSCs and Their Microenvironment One of the major questions raised by CSC hypothesis is whether or not current therapies are in fact targeting the right cells. As discussed above, it has been speculated that CSCs have the ability to avoid or resist current cancer therapies, although this has yet to be definitively proven in the clinical setting. In addition, CSCs may play an important role in tumor metastasis and dormancy. So, the idea that cancers could be effectively treated by selectively targeting CSCs and their microenvironmental niche, which contributes to self-renewal of these cells, has attracted tremendous clinical interest [81]. 568 H. Yan et al. 5.1 CSC-Targeted Therapy As molecular mediators of therapeutic resistance in CSCs gradually become established, developing clinically useful inhibitors to target these pathways will be correspondingly prioritized. 5.1.1 Anti-ABC Transporters A connection between CSCs and drug resistance is thought to exist due to the expression of ABC transporters. Inhibition of ABC transporter activity should hinder CSC drug resistance and make CSCs more sensitive to chemotherapeu- tics. A number of inhibitors targeting ABCB1 including verapamil, cyclospor- ine, PSC833, and VX710 have been identified [80, 82]. However, negative results have been observed in clinical trials of these drugs possibly because other transporters, particularly ABCG2, also need to be efficiently inhibited to achieve a significant effect in the clinic. At present, tariquidar, effective against ABCB1 and ABCG2, is being tested, but some phase III clinical trials were terminated early owing to an increased incidence of adverse effects [83]. Selective downregulation of MDR genes in cancer cells is an emerging approach in therapeutics. Technologies that enable the targeted regulation of genes, including antisense oligonucleotides, hammerhead ribozymes, and short- interfering RNA, have produced mixed results. However, sufficient downregu- lation of MDR genes such as MDR1 has proved difficult to attain and the safe delivery of constructs to cancer cells in vivo remains a challenges [59]. Interest- ingly, recent studies have revealed the possibility of using the agents targeting the EGFR, Hedgehog, Wnt/b-catenin, and/or Notch cascades to inhibit the ABC multidrug efflux transporters and/or eliminate the CSCs [84–90]. For instance, in the cyclopamine treatment for CD44+ PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cells, a decrease of the expression levels of MDR1/ABCB1 and BCRP/ ABCG2 was observed, suggesting that Hedgehog signaling activity may con- tribute to MDR expression in these cancer cells [89]. Since cancers rely on several mechanisms to escape drugs, ABC transporter inhibitors will have to be combined with other strategies to achieve efficient elimination of CSCs in vivo. 5.1.2 Inhibiting DNA Repair Capacity CSCs may efficiently repair their DNA to escape from DNA damage, raising the possibility that inhibiting DNA repair capacity of CSCs could be an effective strategy to sensitize CSC to current therapy. Recent studies in human glioblastomas have shown that checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and check- point kinase 2 (Chk2) play a key role in CD133+ glioma stem cell survival to radiation by efficiently repairing damaged DNA; consequently, inhibition of Chk1/Chk2 kinases renders these CSCs less resistant to radiation [77]. These Cancer Stem Cells 569 observations suggest that selective suppression of DNA repair mechanisms may help overcome radioresistance of CSCs. 5.1.3 Promoting Apoptosis Although tumor cell death is controlled by several mechanisms, one of the dominant mechanisms involves mitochondria [91]. It is thus rational to target the mitochondria for therapeutic purposes due to its critical role in the regulation of apoptosis. One potential target is the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), the most significant component of which appears to be the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor known as the translocator protein [92]. Various ligands for the translocator protein have shown both anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity or may act as chemo-sensitizers via modulation of MPTP [93–95]. In addition to mitochondria, other prosurvival signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) and BCL-2 family proteins may also become targets for cancer therapy as CSCs generally have higher activities or expres- sions of these pathways. 5.1.4 Sensitizing Dormant CSCs to Anti-proliferative Agents Many types of cancer can persist as ‘‘minimal residual disease,’’ and putative metastasis SCs can remain dormant for years, but are re-activated by as-yet unknown mechanisms, often leading to rapid disease progression [96]. One possible strategy to sensitize dormant CSCs to anti-proliferative agents would be to promote their cell-cycle entry using cytokines known to activate normal SCs. For example, imatinib treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) CSCs intermittently activated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G- CSF) in vitro resulted in an enhanced efficacy of CML–CSC elimination compared with treatment using imatinib alone [97]. However, to utilize this strategy in the clinic, new markers have to be developed to determine whether a patient has dormant disseminated disease. At present, most of the markers inform about the recurrence of the disease (e.g., uPAR, ErbB2) rather than the state of tumor cell dormancy [98]. To achieve this goal it will be important to enhance collaborations between basic research and clinical labs to test the markers of dormancy identified in experimental models in samples from bone marrow, lymph nodes, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) [98]. These will be important for staging of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic targets. 5.1.5 Inducing CSCs into Dormancy Therapies aimed at inducing dormancy may help overcome conventional drug resistance that is based on the ability of drugs to induce cell killing. Thus, reprogramming cancer cells into a growth arrest would allow converting the disease that would be otherwise untreatable, into a chronic asymptomatic condition. Combination of mitogenic signaling inhibitors (e.g., MEK, MET, 570 H. Yan et al. EGFR, IGFR inhibitors) with activators of stress pathways (e.g., p38, JNK) may induce reprogramming of tumor cells into dormancy [99]. 5.1.6 Promoting Differentiation of CSCs The tumorigenic potential of CSCs generally correlates with their capacity to undergo long-term self-renewal [46]. Self-renewal activity is inversely correlated to differentiation, raising the possibility that enforced differentiation of CSCs could be an effective strategy to decrease or eliminate CSCs activity. This type of therapeutic strategy has been used to treat hematological malignancies such as leukemia, where the cancer-initiating cells and the cellular differentiation hierarchy are well characterized [100, 101]. The first differentiation agent suc- cessful in the clinic was all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This strategy has recently been reported in human glioblastoma, where it was shown that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) promote the differentiation of not only normal neural progenitors, but also of CD133+ glioma SCs toward a more mature astrocyte fate [102]. These findings should lead to renewed interest in devising therapies that promote the differentiation of cancer (stem) cells. Although differentiation therapy does not kill cancer cells, it does have the potential to restrain their self-renewal capacity and perhaps increase the efficacy of conventional therapies, which are often most effective on differentiated cells. Furthermore, differentiation agents often have less toxicity than conventional chemotherapies [103, 104]. 5.2 CSC Niche-Targeted Therapy In light of the central role of niche in maintaining quiescence and self-renewal of CSCs, strategies for reduction of the SC population must take into account the importance of targeting niche. HSCs need hypoxic niche to protect them from oxidative stress because reactive oxygen species induce p38-MAPK-mediated proliferation leading to HSC exhaus- tion [105]. Some CSCs may also be concealed in hypoxic microenvironments, which are common in solid tumors. Given that hypoxia seems to be important in maintaining CSCs, this provides an opportunity for tumor-selective therapy. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is stabilized under hypoxic conditions and promotes survival of cancer cells in hypoxic niches, so several strategies to inacti- vate HIF-1 are currently under investigation at the preclinical level [106, 107]. Other niches comprising reticular and endothelial cells known to secrete factors that promote self-renewal and survival have been found in close asso- ciation with the vasculature [108]. Since the niche is dependent on the presence of an efficient blood supply, one therapeutic strategy would be to target the niche endothelium. Clinical use of anti-angiogenic agents has accelerated in Cancer Stem Cells 571 recent years, with more than 40 agents currently in clinical trials for various types of cancers [109]. Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, has shown promise as part of a combination therapy regimen in several advanced cancers, including colon cancer [110] and glioblastoma [111]. Moreover, several agents that were originally developed to block EGFR (erlotinib, cetuximab, and vandetanib) have recently been shown to have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis by blocking VEGFR or by inhibiting pro-angiogenic protein secretion [109]. Furthermore, several lines of evidence have revealed the potential benefit of targeting the tumor-specific vascular precursor cells including the circulating VEGFR-2+ endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and VEGFR-1+ pleural mesothelial cells (PMC), which may be recruited to the activated stromal compartment in the primary and secondary neoplasms, for preventing and/or counteracting the neovascularization process associated with tumor develop- ment [112–115]. More particularly, it has been shown that the use of BM- derived EPCs engineered to express an anti-angiogenic gene product, a soluble truncated form of VEGFR-2, may impair tumor growth in vivo [115]. There are several theories regarding the clinical mechanisms of anti- angiogenic drug benefit. One possibility is that anti-angiogenics simply destroy the vascular structure of the tumor, promoting profound tumor hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Alternatively, anti-angiogenics may transiently normalize the tumor vasculature increasing oxygen and drug delivery [116]. In addition, it seems that some cancers may express VEGF receptors as well, raising the possibility that anti-VEGF therapies actually have direct anti-tumor effects. Cell adhesion molecule CD44 is expressed on both normal and leukemic SCs and mediates adhesive interactions with the endosteal BM niche by binding to various ligands [117]. Therefore, it is possible to separate the leukemic SCs from its microenvironment by anti-CD44 therapy. In support, monoclonal antibody ligation of the CD44 effectively eliminated AML SCs derived from some patients [118]. Also, treatment of prostate and breast cancer cell lines with an siRNA against CD44 can decrease cancer cell adhesion to BM endothelial cells [119]. It is well known that signaling molecules such as Hedgehog, Wnt, BMP, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and Notch-1 play important roles in niche control of cell fate determination [120], making it possible to develop novel cancer therapeutics by targeting these signaling pathways. Some studies have shown that the Hedgehog and Notch-1 signaling activities can be attenuated via Hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine and Notch-1 inhibitor GSI, respectively [86, 121]. 5.3 Combination Therapy Strategy A few considerations make combination therapy necessary in clinic. First, due to inherent genomic instability, differentiated cancer cells may acquire SC pheno- types, and also possibly acquire resistance to therapeutics. Thus, eradication of 572 H. Yan et al. the tumor will likely be achieved only by successful targeting of all cancer cells. Furthermore, most of CSC- or niche-targeted therapies aim at sensitizing CSCs to current therapy or inhibiting CSC activity including anti-apoptosis and che- moresistance to cytotoxic drugs, not killing CSCs directly. Finally, the fact the tumor cells survive anti-tumor therapeutics via variegated mechanisms suggests that single targeting therapy would not effectively eradicate the disease. In one word, in order to eliminate CSCs and cure cancer, it seems reasonable that combining traditional therapy with one or several agents that sensitize CSCs or target CSC niche would be a good approach to rationally advance the treatment of tumors. For example, depletion of blood vessels by anti-VEGF therapy could cause a dramatic reduction in the number of medulloblastoma SCs, but this regimen had little effect on the proliferation and survival of non- CSC tumor progenitors. The combination of anti-angiogenic drugs and con- ventional therapies could be highly cooperative [122]. 6 Conclusions and Future Directions Cancer recurrence and metastasis are major challenges of cancer therapy. Tumor dormancy may be one of the major reasons of cancer relapse and metastasis, and due to resistance, a subset of cancer cells that survives therapy may become the origin of cancer recurrence. The revived CSC hypothesis provides us new insight on understanding cancer cell resistance to therapeutics, especially to chemotherapy. CSCs are defined as a minor population of cancer cells that possesses the capacity to self-renew and to cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor. Several experimental strategies such as utilizing specific markers, SP analysis, clonal and clonogenic assays, and LRC tracking can be utilized to identify or enrich for putative CSCs. Some evidence suggests that CSCs might play key role in cancer metastasis and dormancy. Like normal SCs, CSCs might be endowed with higher intrinsic capability to escape chemotherapy through their relative quiescence, ABC transporter expression, dysregulation in apoptotic signaling and increased prosurvival mechanisms, and their capacity for DNA repair. CSC niche is the specific microenvironment in which CSCs grow. It provides critical factors for the long-term survival and self-renewal of CSCs. Because CSCs are supposed to contribute to tumor development and metastasis as well as relapse after tradi- tional therapies, it is of a great clinical potential that novel therapeutic strategies selectively target CSCs and their microenvironmental niche. Many clinical trials of drugs targeting bulk cancer cells or CSCs and their niches, although exciting and effective in preclinical trials, have not yielded positive results in patients. There are two possible reasons to explain this discrepancy. First, the preclinical models may be inappropriate. Numerous agents have shown very promising activity in animal models but have minimal clinical activity. One of the main reasons for this failure is the use of Cancer Stem Cells 573 inappropriate mouse models for preclinical assays which are not CSC-based mouse models. So, the development of strategies to target CSCs and their niches will require new approaches for the preclinical evaluation of their efficacy [58]. In addition, drugs targeting CSCs also possibly affect normal SCs, with which CSCs share many properties. Because we use much of the knowledge gained about normal SCs to design new strategies against CSCs, most of these ideas center around attacking the stem-like properties of CSCs, and normal SCs may also be targeted in the process [54]. For example, blocking ABC transporters, such as ABCG2 and ABCB1, may make CSCs more sensitive to chemotherapy, but may also cause the body’s normal SCs to become sensitive to drugs and die prematurely. So, more work is needed with regard to delineating the similarities and differences between normal SCs and CSCs in order to identify possible therapeutic strategies that would effectively and specifically eradicate CSCs while leaving normal SCs unharmed.

It has been historically known in ancient India and China for the treatment of skin dis- orders. In Western medicine, the first experimental evidence of photodynamic therapy was reported by Raab et al. who observed the lethality of acridine dyes to paramecium in the presence of light [1]. The photodynamic effect was further demonstrated by Tappeiner and colleagues who reported killing of basal cell carcinoma using eosin and light illumination [2]. More recently, Dougherty et al. developed a hematoporphyrin derivative, which was shown to kill cancer cells in vitro and mammary tumors in mouse models in vivo [3]. Photodynamic therapy has evolved as an effective therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. In 1995, the FDA approved photodynamic therapy using Photofrin for the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer. Recent developments in biomedical imaging provide new opportunities for photodynamic therapy. Modern ima- ging technologies can accurately detect and diagnose malignant tumors at an early stage and can effectively assess tumor response to cancer photodynamic therapy. Combining photodynamic therapy with imaging can provide image guidance for accurate laser irradiation of tumor and timely assessment of therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic therapy. Image-guided photodynamic therapy is a new, minimally invasive cancer treatment modality that can further improve the efficacy of photodynamic therapy. 2 Photodynamic Therapy Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the administration of a photosensitizer and activation of the photosensitizer with light irradiation in the tumor tissue, resulting in cancer cell death. Photodynamic therapy causes cell death through Z.-R. Lu (*) Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA e-mail: zhengrong.lu@utah.edu Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_18, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 581 two different mechanisms. When a photosensitizer accumulated in target cells is activated with laser light of a specific wavelength based on its absorbance, it absorbs photons and becomes photochemically excited. The excited photosen- sitizer then transfers the energy to molecular oxygen to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide (O2\u0002), which cause cell damage and cell death [4, 5]. The second mechanism involves energy transfer from the excited photosensitizer to cellular biomolecules, including DNA and RNA, catalyzing photochemical reactions of the biomolecules, such as 2 + 2 cycloaddition reactions in the nucleic acids, resulting in cytotoxicity. In general, photosensitizers have conjugate structures that absorb light with a long wavelength (>600 nm). These compounds are preferred because a longer wavelength, e.g., red light, has minimal tissue interaction and offers better tissue penetration than a shorter wavelength. Photosensitizers are derivatives of porphyrins, chlorins, and cyanins. Photofrin (Porfimer Sodium), a hematopor- phyrin derivative, was the first photosensitizer clinically approved for the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer, early non-small-cell lung cancer, advanced lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and intraepithelial neoplasia [6, 7]. Several other photosensitizers, including meta-tetrahydrophenylchlorin (mTHPC, Foscan1) [8, 9], benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD-MA, Visudyne1) [10, 11], 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, Levulan1) [12,13], and methyl aminolevulinate (MLA, Metvix) [14], have also been approved for clinical applications. Figure 1 shows the chemical structures of some of the clinically approved photosensitizers. Both ALA and MLA are the precursors for in vivo synthesis of porphyrins and they can be converted to active forms of photosensitizers after in vivo administration. Activation of photosensitizers with light is crucial in producing the photo- dynamic effect. Photosensitizers do not have any therapeutic efficacy without light activation. Light of the wavelength corresponding to the maximal absorp- tion of the photosensitizers is required to produce optimal irradiation and generation of cytotoxic species. Laser light of longer wavelength has better penetration in tissues due to reduced interaction with surrounding tissues and is preferred for photodynamic therapy. The application of light is mainly expressed in terms of fluence rate, which is defined as the radiant energy per second across a sectional area (W/cm2), and fluence, which is defined as the total energy input across a sectional area (J/cm2). Light dose applied to the tumor tissue must be over a minimum threshold to enable tissue penetration for the maximal therapeutic effect. At the same time, a very high light dose may lead to thermal toxicity to normal tissues beyond the target tissue. Fractionated light dosing, several low doses instead of one high dose, has been observed to produce more efficacious therapy in tumors [15, 16, 17]. Although the lower fluence rate required longer treatment times, they showed lower toxic side effects when compared to higher fluence rates [18]. Photodynamic therapy causes cell death via necrosis and activation of sig- naling pathways that elicit apoptotic and/or autophagic response [19, 20]. Irradiation of cells in the presence of a photosensitizer leads to damage of cell 582 Z.-R. Lu and A. Vaidya membranes/internal structures and causes release of stress signals, ultimately triggering apoptosis or necrosis. Necrosis is a form of traumatic cell death associated with acute cell injury, while apoptosis is programmed cell death, occurring naturally in the body. Several photosensitizers are known to activate caspases, the apoptotic proteins, in the mitochondria to induce apoptosis in photodynamic therapy. Photofrin is known to elicit both apoptosis and necrosis in tumor cells in photodynamic therapy [21]. Necrosis can be caused by damage to cell membrane and disruption of cellular function [22]. Autophagy, or cellular self-digestion, is a cellular pathway involved in protein and organelle degradation and represents the response of the cell to starvation [23]. Initial autophagic response followed by apoptosis has been observed for mouse leu- kemia cells in response to photodynamic therapy using hypericin, which is known to target the endoplasmic reticulum [24]. Double membrane encased Fig. 1 Chemical structures of some of the second-generation photosensitizers Image-Guided Photodynamic Cancer Therapy 583 autophagosomal vesicles have also been observed by electron microscopy in photodynamically treated MCF-7 cells receiving phthalocyanine photosensiti- zer [25]. The cell-kill effects depend on the structure and composition of the photosensitizer, its uptake into the cells, and subcellular localization and it is difficult to segregate these mechanisms. Photodynamic therapy causes vascular damage at the tissue level, which results in tumor regression as an indirect effect. The production of reactive oxygen species upon irradiation of the photosensitizer has been shown to damage the endothelium when the photosensitizer localizes in the tumor microvascula- ture [26]. Tumor vasculature subjected to photodynamic therapy is associated with release of thromboxane, histamine, and von Hildebrand factor [27, 28], which cause vasoconstriction, vasodilation, aggregation of blood cells, blood flow stasis, hypoxia, and cell death [29, 30]. Studies have shown that the efficacy of photodynamic therapy is determined to a large extent by the degree of damage to tumor microvasculature [31, 32]. This is corroborated by the fact that the efficacy of photodynamic therapy can be augmented by co-administration of antiangiogenic therapy [33, 34]. Targeting photosensitizers specifically on tumor stroma increases the efficacy of photodynamic therapy [35, 36]. Photodynamic therapy can also induce tumor immune response, resulting in better therapeutic efficacy. Immunity in response to photodynamic therapy is elicited by several mechanisms. Photoxidative damage triggers several cell signal transduction pathways [3, 37], causing expression of stress proteins [38,39]. It activates the nuclear factor AP-1, resulting in cytokines like IL-16, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-a [40, 41]. Immune response is considered more significant in long-term cancer management rather than in short-term tumor cell-kill effect. Photodynamic therapy is well tolerated with minimal accumulative toxicity in patients as compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It is minimally invasive and highly specific and does not cause scarring after the treatment. However, clinical application of photodynamic therapy is still limited to treat superficial lesions because it requires accurate light irradiation. Another chal- lenge for effective photodynamic therapy is the specific delivery of the photo- sensitizer into cancer cells. Current photosensitizers do not have good specificity to cancer cells. Recent development in drug delivery and biomedical imaging allows efficient delivery of photosensitizers into tumor tissues and accurate location of non-superficial lesions for effective photodynamic therapy. 3 Bifunctional Polymer Conjugates The conjugation of therapeutics to water-soluble biomedical polymers increases the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic drugs and reduces systemic toxicity [42, 43]. The polymer drug conjugates can preferentially accumulate in solid tumor tissues due to the hyperpermeability of tumor blood vessels or the 584 Z.-R. Lu and A. Vaidya so-called ‘‘enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect’’ [44, 45]. Polymer drug conjugates can also downregulate or overcome multiple drug resistance [46, 47]. Because of these unique properties, polymer drug conjugates exhibit much higher therapeutic efficacy than free drugs. Currently, several polymer drug conjugates are used in clinical cancer treatment, and more are in the pipeline for clinical development [48–50]. The conjugation of photosensitizers to biocompatible water-soluble polymers reduces their dark toxicity and accu- mulation in the skin and increases their accumulation in solid tumor tissues, resulting in high anticancer efficacy with PDT [51]. For example, conjugation of photosensitizer mesochlorin e6 into HPMA copolymers resulted in a maximum tumor uptake of 5.5% of the total administered dose (TAD) of the photosensi- tizer in a mice tumor model, while the maximum tumor uptake of free meso- chlorin e6 was less than 0.5% of TAD [51, 52]. Consequently, higher anticancer efficacy with photodynamic therapy was observed with the polymeric conjugates. Imaging probes or contrast agents can be readily incorporated into polymer conjugates to allow non-invasive tracking of the conjugates and accurate tumor detection with biomedical imaging modalities to guide photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment, particularly for the treatment of non-superficial lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive clinical imaging modality. It provides high-resolution images of soft tissues and is effective for cancer detection. Paramagnetic substances are often used as MRI contrast agents to increase image contrast between tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissue for accurate cancer detection and diagnosis. Covalent conjugation of an MRI contrast agent to the polymer photosensitizer conjugate provides bifunctional polymer conjugates. The bifunctional conjugates will allow real-time and non- invasive visualization of the biodistribution of the conjugates with MRI, accu- rate localization of non-superficial tumor, and the determination of the exact timing of site-directed irradiation of tumors, leading to better therapeutic efficacy. Poly-(L-glutamic acid), PGA, is a biocompatible drug carrier and has a large number of functional side chains suitable for preparation of bifunctional conjugates. A bifunctional conjugate, PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-mesochlorin e6 (Mce6) conjugate, was prepared for contrast-enhanced MRI-guided photo- dynamic therapy [53]. Gd-DO3A is a macrocyclic MRI contrast agent with high in vivo stability, and mesochlorin e6 is a photosensitizer. Figure 2A shows the structure of the bifunctional conjugate. Mce6 and Gd-DO3A contents in the conjugate were 0.078 and 0.62 mmol/g-polymer, respectively. A relatively large number of Gd-DO3A chelates were conjugated because MRI has a relatively low sensitivity to visualize the contrast agents. T1 relaxivity of the conjugate was 8.46 mM\u00021 s\u00021 per complexed Gd(III) ion at 3 T. Relaxivity of an MRI contrast agent is a measurement of the ability of the agent to generate signal enhancement in contrast-enhanced MRI [54]. Usually, polymer con- jugates of MRI contrast agents have higher relaxivities than corresponding free contrast agents. Image-Guided Photodynamic Cancer Therapy 585 The bifunctional polymer conjugates can be readily modified to opti- mize their pharmacokinetic properties to achieve better tumor-targeting efficiency and better therapeutic outcome. The modification of bifunc- tional polymer conjugates with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has a potential to modify the pharmacokinetics of the bifunctional conjugate by reducing non-specific tissue interaction, increasing blood circulation, and improving tumor-targeting efficiency. The conjugate of poly(L-glutamic acid) meso- chlorin e6 and Gd-DO3A was modified with PEG of 2000 Da to optimize the pharmacokinetics and to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the bifunctional conjugates [55]. The structure of the PEGylated bifunctional conjugate, PEG-PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6, is shown in Fig. 2B. The physical parameters of the conjugates and the control conjugate, PGA-(Gd-DO3A), are listed in Table 1. Although the conjugates were prepared from the same poly(L-glutamic acid), they had different apparent molecular weights due to the changes in their hydrodynamic volumes after various chemical a b Fig. 2 Chemical structures of a bifunctional poly(L-glutamic acid)-(Gd-DO3A)-mesochlorin e6 conjugate (A) and its pegylated bifunctional conjugate (B) 586 Z.-R. Lu and A. Vaidya modifications. The PEGylated conjugate had lower T1 relaxivity than the non-PEGylated conjugates because PEG reduced the water exchange rate of Gd chelates. 4 Non-invasive Imaging of Pharmacokinetics of Polymer Conjugates The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of polymer drug conjugates are traditionally investigated by sacrificing a large number of experimental animals at various time points. Biomedical imaging allows non-invasive evaluation of the real-time pharmacokinetics and whole body distribution of polymer conjugates in the same group of animals in preclinical development. Several clinical imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and ultrasound, can be used for non-invasive pharmacokinetic studies, including guiding cancer therapies. Among these imaging modalities, con- trast-enhanced MRI produces excellent anatomic images with high spatial resolution [56]. MRI is a non-invasive clinical imaging modality. MRI provides three- dimensional images of biological structures with high spatial resolution. MR image contrast is created based on the differences in proton densities and the longitudinal or transverse relaxation rates (1/T1 or 1/T2) of protons in the body. Paramagnetic metal chelates (e.g., Gd(III) and Mn(II) complexes) [54, 57] can alter the relaxation rates of water protons and are used as MRI contrast agents. The most commonly used clinical MRI contrast agents are stable Gd(III) chelates, including Gd-DTPA [58], Gd-(DTPA-BMA) [59], Gd-DOTA [60], and Gd-(HP-DO3A) [61]. These agents increase water proton T1 relaxation rate and MRI signal intensity in tissues with high concentrations of the contrast agents, creating image contrast enhancement with surrounding tissues. Con- trast-enhanced MRI is routinely used in cancer imaging. Polymer conjugates can be readily labeled with the paramagnetic chelates for non-invasive visuali- zation of the in vivo properties, including biodistribution and pharmacoki- netics, of the polymer conjugates.

In T1-weighted MR images, bright signal indicates high concentration of the paramagnetically labeled conjugates with similar relaxiv- ities [62]. Figure 3A shows three-dimensional T1-weighted coronal MR images of tumor-bearing mice before and at various time points after the injection of the PHPMA-GFLG-(Gd-DO3A) with an average molecular weight of 121 kDa at a dose of 0.03 mmol-Gd/kg [63]. These dynamic MR images of the same mouse clearly showed the blood pharmacokinetics of the conjugate. Strong blood signal was observed at the initial period after injection and the signal then gradually faded away. The MR images revealed that the high molecular weight polymer conjugate had relatively prolonged blood circulation. The prolonged blood circulation was shown for the conjugates with higher molecular weights. The conjugate was still visible in the blood 72 h post-injection. Prolonged blood circulation of the conjugate might result in high accumulation in tumor tissue due to EPR effect. MRI also revealed the dynamic and heterogeneous distribution of the labeled conjugate in tumor tissue. Figure 3B shows the color-coded contrast enhance- ment in tumor tissues. Significant contrast enhancement was first observed at tumor periphery after the initial injection of the conjugate and then gradually in the tumor interstitium, indicating that distribution of the polymer conjugate started at the tumor periphery and gradually diffused in the inner tumor tissue. Significant contrast enhancement was shown in tumor tissue for at least 3 days after the injection, indicating the prolonged presence of the conjugate in tumor tissue. Contrast-enhanced MRI provides non-invasive, continuous, and detailed evaluation on the biodistribution of polymer conjugates, while conventional pharmacokinetics only provides average distribution data.

Vaidya The real-time pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of PEG-PGA-(Gd- DO3A)-Mce6, PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6, and PGA-(Gd-DO3A) were non- invasively evaluated by contrast-enhanced MRI [55]. Figure 4 shows the three-dimensional MR images of mice bearing MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma xenografts before and at various time points after intra- venous injection of the polymer conjugates at the same Gd(III) equivalent dose (0.05 mmol-Gd/kg). The MR images clearly revealed the structural effects of the conjugates on blood pharmacokinetics and liver distribution of the conjugates. The unPEGylated conjugates, particularly PGA-(Gd- DO3A)-Mce6, showed strong enhancement in the liver, indicating high liver accumulation. PEGylated bifunctional conjugate showed much less liver enhancement, suggesting that pegylation of the conjugate significantly reduced non-specific liver accumulation of bifunctional conjugate. As a result, strong and prolonged enhancement was shown in the vasculature of Fig. 4 Three-dimensional MIP images (coronal view) of mice before (a) and at 2 min (b), 5 min (c), 15 min (d), 30 min (e), 2 h (f), and 18 h (g) after intravenous injection of 0.05 mmol-Gd/kg PEG-PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 (top panel), PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 (middle panel), and PGA- (Gd-DO3A) (bottom panel) Image-Guided Photodynamic Cancer Therapy 589 the mice injected with the PEGylated conjugate, indicating prolonged blood circulation of the PEGylated conjugate. The MR images also showed that all of the conjugates could be readily excreted via renal filtration and accumulated in the urinary bladder. Figure 5 shows axial T1-weighted 2D spin-echo images of tumor tissues of the mice before and at various time points after intravenous injection of the con- jugates [55]. Heterogeneous tumor contrast enhancement is shown in the tumor tissue, indicating heterogeneous tumor distribution of the conjugates. It appears that the PEGylated conjugate resulted in more significant tumor enhancement. Quantitative analysis of MR signal intensities provides semi-quantitative estimation of dynamic biodistribution of the conjugates in the blood, liver, and tumor. Figure 6 shows the dynamic changes of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the blood, liver, and tumor [55]. Large SNR generally indicates high concentration of Gd-DO3A-labeled conjugates, but such correlation is not linear. Nonetheless, semi-quantitative analysis clearly shows the pharmaco- kinetic property of the conjugates in different tissues. The bifunctional con- jugate and PGA-(GD-DO3A) had similar pharmacokinetics in the blood, liver, and tumor. PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 had relatively short blood circula- tion and high liver uptake possibly due to the hydrophobic interaction of mesochlorin e6 with the reticuloendothelial system. The modification of PGA- (Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 with mPEG of 2 kDa significantly reduced the non-specific liver uptake of the photosensitizer conjugate at the same Gd(III) dose. The PEGylated conjugate resulted in more prolonged blood enhancement than PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 and higher tumor accumulation due to the ‘‘EPR’’ effect.

Drugs containing PEGylated and non-PEGylated conjugates were injected at a dose of 6 mg-Mce6/kg. PGA-(Gd-DO3A) was injected at Gd equivalent dose of 0.045 mmol/kg. Each tumor received 15 min irradiation at a dose of 180 J/cm 2, 18 and 24 h after the injection of the conjugates. Figure 7 shows the percentage of increase in tumor size after the treatments with the PEGylated, non-PEGylated, and control conjugates as compared to that before the treat- ments. PEG-PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth as compared to PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 and PGA-(Gd-DO3A) (p<0.05). The therapeutic efficacy of the bifunctional conjugates in photodynamic therapy correlated well with the biodistribution of the conjugates as revealed by the contrast-enhanced MRI. The PEGylated conjugate, which had high tumor accumulation with low non-specific tissue, resulted in more effective suppression of tumor growth with site-directed photodynamic therapy. In comparison, the non-PEGylated conjugate, which showed high non-specific liver accumulation and low tumor accumulation, was less effective than the PEGylated conjugate in photodynamic therapy. The combination of contrast-enhanced MRI with photodynamic therapy based on the bifunctional conjugates can effectively localize tumor and esti- mate pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation of the conjugate and provide Fig. 7 Efficacy of photodynamic therapy for polymer conjugates in MDA-MB-231 xenografts- bearing nude mice. Efficacy is expressed as the percentage increase in relative tumor size for mice receiving PEG-PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 (^), PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 (&) at a Mce6 equivalent dose of 6.0 mg/kg, and PGA-(Gd-DO3A) at a dose of 0.045 mmol-Gd/kg (~) after the tumors were irradiated at 18 and 24 h post-injection 592 Z.-R. Lu and A. Vaidya the needed image guidance for photodynamic therapy to effectively treat non- superficial tumors. Contrast-enhanced MRI is effective to track bifunctional polymer conjugates labeled with a contrast agent, which is useful to determine the suitable timing for laser irradiation to achieve the best therapeutic out- come. High-resolution contrast-enhanced MRI images also allow accurate tumor detection. Accurate tumor localization is critical to guide laser irradia- tion of non-superficial tumors in photodynamic therapy. Image-guided photodynamic therapy is less invasive compared to other image-guided thera- pies, including image-guided thermoablation, cryoablation, laser ablation, and radiofrequency ablation, that have been used for clinical cancer treatment [64–66]. These techniques are still relatively invasive and it is very difficult to completely ablate tumor tissue without harming the normal tissue. In com- parison, image-guided photodynamic therapy is a less invasive approach for specific cancer treatment. 6 Non-invasive Assessment of Tumor Response with Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI measures the uptake kinetics of an MRI contrast agent in tumor tissue. Vascularity, the density of tumor micro- vessels, and tumor blood vessel permeability are important parameters for assessing response of tumor tissues to therapies. These tumor physiological properties can be evaluated from the uptake kinetics of contrast agents [67–69]. These parameters can be used to evaluate tumor response to therapies, including antiangiogenic therapy. Since macromolecules have limited extrava- sation in normal blood vessels and are hyperpermeable to the leaky tumor blood vasculature, DCE-MRI with macromolecular MRI contrast agents is considered to be more accurate in tumor characterization than low molecular weight contrast agents [70–73]. However, DCE-MRI with macromolecular contrast agents is limited to preclinical studies in evaluating therapeutic response because no macromolecular MRI contrast agent is available for clinical applications due to their slow excretion from the body and related safety concerns. Recently, biodegradable macromolecular MRI contrast agents based on polydisulfide Gd(III) chelates have been developed to alleviate the safety concerns and are promising for clinical development [74–77]. Tumor response to photodynamic therapy with different conjugates was non-invasively evaluated with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and a biode- gradable macromolecular MRI contrast agent, (Gd-DTPA)-cystine copoly- mers (GDCP) [78]. Figure 8 shows the representative dynamic change of relative signal intensity in peripheral tumor tissue over 15 min, after intrave- nous administration of GDCP at a dose of 0.1 mmol-Gd/kg. The tumors had different contrast uptake kinetics after treatment with different bifunctional conjugates and the control. The tumors treated with the non-therapeutic Image-Guided Photodynamic Cancer Therapy 593 control PGA-(Gd-DO3A) had rapid initial uptake kinetics because the con- trol had no therapeutic efficacy with photodynamic therapy. Rapid and high tumor contrast uptake kinetics indicates high tumor vascular permeability and tumor viability. The non-PEGylated conjugate had intermediate thera- peutic efficacy and the tumors treated with the conjugate had slower and lower uptake than those treated with the control. Low tumor contrast uptake kinetics indicates low tumor vascular permeability to the macromolecular contrast agent, indicating good tumor response to the therapy. The tumors treated with the PEGylated conjugate had much slower growth after the treatment and showed much slower uptake kinetics than the tumors treated with both PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 and PGA-(Gd-DO3A). The result sug- gested that the PEGylated conjugate was more effective in tumor treatment with photodynamic therapy. The tumor uptake kinetics measured by DCE-MRI correlates well with the tumor growth curves in Fig. 7. PEG-PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 conjugate resulted in significant antitumor efficacy with photodynamic therapy. As a result, tumor microvessel density and vascular permeability significantly decreased. DCE-MRI with the biodegradable macromolecular MRI contrast agent was effective for non-invasive assessment of the tumor vascular perme- ability. As compared to the traditional surgery-based biopsy, DCE-MRI can provide timely and non-invasive assessment of the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with the bifunctional conjugates. DCE-MRI with the biodegradable macromolecular contrast agents is advantageous for the characterization of tumor vascularity because the agents can selectively permeate through the hyperpermeable microvasculature of tumor tissues without extravasating through normal endothelium [79]. 0.8 0.9 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 02 46 8 10 12 14Relative SI Time (min) PEG-PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 PGA-(Gd-DO3A)-Mce6 PGA-Gd-DO3A Fig. 8 Relative signal intensity plots of the DCE-MRI data showing the dynamic uptake of (Gd-DTPA)-cystine copolymers in tumor periphery of mice treated with different conjugates 594 Z.-R. Lu and A. Vaidya 7 Concluding Remarks The advance of imaging technology not only improves cancer detection and diagnosis, but also provides new opportunities for development of new ther- apeutics and cancer treatment modalities. The combination of contrast- enhanced MRI with photodynamic therapy can provide accurate localization of non-superficial tumors and image guidance for laser irradiation of tumors. Paramagnetically labeled bifunctional conjugates are a critical component for image-guided photodynamic therapy, which provides an effective platform for the combination of contrast-enhanced MRI with photodynamic therapy. The hyperpermeability of tumor vasculature or the EPR effect of solid tumor allows preferential accumulation of bifunctional polymer conjugates in tumor tissues, which results in tumor enhancement in MRI for accurate detection and locali- zation of non-superficial tumor. In practical application, MRI can also guide the insertion of an optical fiber to the detected non-superficial tumor for effective photodynamic therapy. Therapeutic efficacy of the image-guided photodynamic therapy can be effectively and non-invasively evaluated with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with a biodegradable macromolecular MRI contrast agent. Image-guided photodynamic therapy is a promising modality in personalized medicine, which provides effective tumor detection and treatment and rapid and non-invasive assessment of therapeutic efficacy.

Image-Guided Photodynamic Cancer Therapy 599 Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications Ce´ lia M.F. Gomes 1 Introduction The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to the success of antineoplastic therapies [1]. The classical mechanism underlying MDR is the overexpression of energy-dependent transmembrane proteins behaving as drug efflux pumps. Three main proteins stand out in this family, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1), and breast cancer- related protein (BCRP). Each of these transporters has the ability to confer resistance to a broad spectrum of hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents as a result of enhanced drug efflux [2]. These pumps, in particular Pgp, have been found in several highly resistant solid and hematological tumors and are associated with a poor prognosis [3–6]. Strategies to circumvent MDR include the co-administration of modulators, compounds that inhibit the functional activity of MDR-related transporters, and the use of cytotoxic agents that bypass the efflux mechanism [7]. Information on the functional expression of MDR-related transporters has the ability to provide a rational basis for devel- oping potentially effective therapies that can be used in patients who are likely to be poor responders to standard chemotherapy and therefore have a poor prognosis under these circumstances. Molecular imaging techniques using radiolabeled probes provide a minimally invasive approach for the functional assessment of MDR in cancer patients. A number of radiopharmaceuticals suitable for single-photon emis- sion tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed and characterized as transport substrates of MDR transporters. Functional evaluation of MDR using imaging probes that mimic the antineo- plastic agents can thus potentially be used to predict chemotherapy response and give information for the inclusion of modulators in therapeutic protocols. The most common imaging probes are the clinically approved 99mTc-labeled C.M.F.

Their usefulness in detecting the MDR phenotype has been demonstrated in several clinical studies in different malignancies [8–10]. PET-based imaging probes including radiola- beled chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., colchicine, daunorubicin) and modulators (verapamil) are currently undergoing investigational clinical studies and have yielded promising results [11]. A standardized SPECT/PET imaging methodology could provide very useful information in the clinical setting by determining the individual tumor suscept- ibility to chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis and even following chemother- apy. This knowledge could serve as a critical tool for optimizing chemotherapeu- tic protocols on a patient-specific basis. This chapter outlines the scientific basis of the molecular imaging probes available for functional assessment of MDR and presents examples of their application in pre-clinical and clinical studies. 2 ABC Transporters and Drug Resistance The ability of tumor cells to develop cross-resistance to a broad range of cytotoxic agents, a trait known as multidrug resistance (MDR), limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy and is responsible for the treatment failure in several malignancies [1]. Nowadays, the emergence of MDR constitutes the major obstacle to the successful management of cancer patients. The classical mechanism underlying the MDR phenotype involves the overexpression of ATP-dependent efflux transmembrane proteins that actively remove the cyto- toxic compounds preventing their intracellular accumulation at toxic levels [2]. Active drug efflux is mediated by several members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transporters that share most of their sequences and present a high degree of structural homology [12]. P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the product of the human MDR1 gene, was the first ABC transporter identified and the most widely studied [13]. This protein was found to be expressed in several resistant tumor cell lines and confers resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated compounds including anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin), epipodophyllotoxins (etoposide, teniposide), vinca alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, vinorelbine), taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel), camptothecins (irinotecan, SN-38, topotecan) and others (colchi- cine, mitoxantrone, actinomycin D, bisantrene) [14]. Most of these drugs have distinct chemical structures and act on a variety of cellular targets, but share the property of being hydrophobic. For several years, Pgp was the only ABC transporter associated with the MDR phenotype. Subsequently other transporters were identified and recognized as energy-dependent drug efflux transporters, such as the multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [15,16]. The chemotherapeutic substrates of these proteins are summarized in Table 1. MRP1 was cloned from a doxorubicin-resistant small-cell lung cancer cell line (H69AR) that did 602 C.M.F. Gomes not express Pgp [15] and is a member of the branch C of the ABC superfamily that comprises nine additional MRP1 homologues as described elsewhere [17]. The drug resistance profile caused by MRP1 is similar to that of Pgp and includes anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, camptothecins, and methotrexate but not taxanes and mitoxantrone [18,19]. Despite these similarities, MRP1 and Pgp have distinct substrates and differ on their trans- port mechanism. The substrates of Pgp are neutral or mildly positive lipophilic compounds, whereas MRP1 has high affinity for lipophilic anions such as heavy metal oxyanions (arsenite and antimony) that are transported as com- plexes of glutathione (GSH), sulfate, or glucuronate [18,20]. Moreover, the transport of some unmodified drugs such as anthracyclines or vinca alkaloids by MRP1 requires free GSH as a co-transporter or a co-factor [21]. The characterization of a mitoxantrone-resistant breast cancer cell line that displayed an efflux-based MDR phenotype without expression of Pgp or MRP1 led to the discovery of BCRP. This transporter, also known as mitoxantrone resistance protein (MXR) or placenta-specific ABC transporter (ABCP), is a half-transporter acting as a homo- or heterodimer to form an active transporter [22]. The substrate specificity of BCRP overlaps somewhat with that of Pgp and MRP1, suggesting a similar role in the pharmacokinetic of chemotherapeutic drugs. In fact, the overexpression of BCRP in tumor cells confers resistance to mitoxantrone, topotecan, SN38, flavopiridol, doxorubicin, bisantrene, etoposide, and methotrexate [16]. It is possible that other members of the ABC superfamily are involved in drug resistance. During the past few years, eight MRP1 homologues (MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, MRP6, MRP7, MRP8, and MRP9), the bile salt export Table 1 Anticancer drugs substrates of Pgp, MRP1 and BCRP Pgp MRP1 BCRP Anthracyclines Doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone Doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin Doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, mitoxantrone Topoisomerase inhibitors Etoposide, teniposide Etoposide Etoposide, topotecan, irinotecan, SN-38 Vinca alkaloids Vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, vinorelbine Vincristine, vinblastine Taxanes Paclitaxel, docetaxel Antitumor antibiotics Actinomycin D, mitomycin C Actinomycin D Antimetabolites Cytarabine Methotrexate Methotrexate Anthracenes Bisantrene Bisantrene Flavonoids Flavopiridol Others Colchicine Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 603 protein (BSEP), first reported as a sister of Pgp (S-Pgp), and the transporter associated with the antigen processing (TAP) have been shown to confer resistance to certain drugs comprising the MDR phenotype and are considered as potential mediators of drug resistance [12,23–25]. Nevertheless the clinical significance of their expression in tumor samples has not been clearly demon- strated [26,27]. 2.1 Clinical Relevance The clinical relevance of ABC transporter’s overexpression in the effective treatment of cancer has been difficult to estimate. Despite the wealth of infor- mation regarding the transport mechanisms and substrate specificity of ABC transporters, translation of this knowledge from the bench to the bedside has been difficult to establish [6,26,28]. Most of the clinical studies performed so far are focused mainly on Pgp. A strong correlation between high levels of Pgp expression and poor clinical outcome has been reported in several malignancies including breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and neuroblastoma [3–5,29–31]. Other studies, however, have failed to demonstrate such correlations and the prognostic significance of Pgp expression in therapy response remains controversial [32–34]. One of the rea- sons for the inconsistency in published data appears to be related with metho- dological issues, especially with analytical methods. In fact, there are currently no universally accepted guidelines for analytical methods or clinical validation [2]. Differences in study design and analytical methods with respect to tissue collecting and molecular targets (mRNA or protein) and the absence of stan- dardized criteria to score the results have limited the ability to compare results from different institutions [26]. Moreover, the heterogeneity in patients groups in terms of patient number, initial or relapse samples, and differences in treatment protocols have also prevented the drawing of reliable conclusions. 2.2 Therapeutic Strategies to Overcome Drug Resistance Reversal of MDR by non-toxic agents that block the activity of ABC transpor- ters has been an important target for cancer therapy. Most attention has been given to inhibition of Pgp as it plays a major role in drug resistance. Since the early 1980s, a large number of compounds of diverse structure have been identified as inhibitors of Pgp and other ABC transporters [35]. These agents also referred to as MDR modulators or reversing agents were classified into three generations according to their characteristics and chronology. The first generation of modulators was not specifically developed for MDR inhibition and includes drugs with pharmacological activity such as calcium channel blockers (verapamil), calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine), steroid agents 604 C.M.F. Gomes (progesterone, tamoxifen), and immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine A) [36]. The high doses required to achieve effective serum concentrations, due to their low affinity for ABC transporters, have resulted in unacceptable high toxicity limiting their application in cancer patients [37]. The second generation of modulators designed to reduce the side effects of the first-generation agents has a better pharmacological profile. They are congeners of the first-generation agents but without some of the negative pharmacological effects. Examples include PSC833 and dexverapamil derivatives of cyclosporine D and verapamil, respectively. Although less toxic, the second-generation modulators still retain some characteristics that limit their clinical usefulness due to unpredictable pharmacokinetic interactions [7]. Many anticancer agents are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme and so are the second-generation modulators [38]. The competition of the two drugs for cytochrome P450 3A4 leads to an increase in the plasmatic concentrations of anticancer drug increasing their adverse effects. Since the pharmacokinetic interactions between modulators and cytotoxic agents are unpredictable, reducing the dose of the cytotoxic agent may result in under-dosing [38,39]. Moreover, these modulators are substrates of other ABC transporters that have a physiological role in regulat- ing the permeability of the central nervous system, testis, and placenta to protect these systems from being exposed to xenobiotics. Their inhibition could decrease the ability of normal tissues to protect themselves from the adverse effects of anticancer drugs [40]. Recently, a new generation of Pgp modulators has been developed to specifically target Pgp based on structure–- activity relationship data [37]. This third generation of modulators offers sig- nificant improvements as they are efficient at nanomolar concentrations and are not metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 [38]. Several compounds (tar- iquidar, zozuquidar, biricodar) are currently undergoing clinical trials. Data from phase I/II studies showed minimal pharmacokinetic interactions with anticancer agents, such as paclitaxel, vinorelbine, or doxorubicin, docetaxel and some of them are ongoing phase III clinical trials [41–43]. However, first reports showed either miscellaneous or negative results not meeting criteria for a study expansion [44–46]. Nevertheless the approach in which conventional chemotherapeutic agents are combined with MDR modulators is still consid- ered valid and the search for a fourth generation of MDR modulators is ongoing [7]. A novel strategy to overcome MDR based on down-regulation of ABC transporters and enzymes involved in drug resistance has been developed. Recent advances in antisense oligonucleotide technologies have led to the development of short hairpin RNA interference (shRNA) against MDR1 mRNA. A complete reversal of Pgp-mediated drug resistance to doxorubicin, colchicine, and taxol was achieved in doxorubicin-resistant K562 cells stably expressing shRNA [47]. Ablation of Pgp in cells stably transduced with retro- viral-mediated shRNA was documented by western blot and functionally con- firmed by increased sensitivity of MDR1-transfected cells toward vincristine, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin [48]. In the same study, Pichler et al. used shRNA Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 605 targeting a MDR1-firefly luciferase construct stably transfected in the liver of mice to follow in vivo by bioluminescence imaging, the downregulation of MDR1 expression [48]. Gene silencing approaches seem to have a great poten- tial in the treatment of drug resistance tumors. The main obstacle to the development of shRNA-based therapeutic approaches is related with the deliv- ery of the plasmid/vector to the target cells, especially in solid tumors, where delivery could be hampered by inadequate vascularization and microenviron- mental factors. Moreover, due to the physiological expression of MDR1 gene in several normal epithelial and endothelial cells, it will be important to restrict delivery of shRNA to Pgp-expressing tumor cells. 2.3 Detection of ABC Transporters in Tumors MDR-related transporters can be measured at mRNA level by reverse transcrip- tase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or at protein level by immunohisto- chemistry with monoclonal antibodies. Presently, the poor sensitivity and the lack of specificity of many commonly used antibodies along with difficulties associated with sample preparation, mostly related with contamination by normal tissue and data analysis, are impeditive for the achievement of reliable results [49,50]. The mRNA copy genes detected by RT-PCR do not always reflect the protein expres- sion levels and the detection of MDR-related transporters at both gene and protein levels cannot predict their functional activity. Specific mutations as well as the phosphorylation status of the proteins can affect their functionality [14]. Flow cytometry assays using fluorescent markers have been developed to assess the functional activity of MDR-related proteins following administration of specific MDR inhibitors. The intracellular accumulation of Pgp substrates such as rhoda- mine 123, daunorubicin, Calcein-AM, or Hoechst 33342 is measured in the pre- sence and in the absence of a Pgp-specific inhibitor [51,52]. Increases in the intracellular levels of fluorescence after exposure to a specific inhibitor reveal the presence of an active efflux pump. The functional flow cytometry as well as RT- PCR and immunohistochemistry are performed ex vivo, which implies to perform a tumor biopsy and sample processing. If this is not a significant obstacle for hematological malignancies, the same is not valid for solid tumors, which require more laborious procedures for sample collection and tissue purification. 2.4 Functional Assays Using Radiolabeled Molecules The emergence of molecular imaging techniques using radiolabeled probes as surrogate markers of chemotherapeutic agents provides an alternative approach for functional assessment of MDR in cancer patients. Over the last decade, advances in medical imaging modalities together with the development of novel-specific imaging probes extended the traditional role of imaging in cancer from detection and staging of disease to tracking specific molecular pathways in cells or tissue function. A number of radiopharmaceuticals 606 C.M.F. Gomes suitable for single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emis- sion tomography (PET) have been developed and characterized as transport substrates of MDR transporters. Studies performed in cellular models of resis- tance have shown that cells exhibiting the MDR phenotype accumulate smaller amounts of radiopharmaceuticals in comparison with the sensitive counter- parts, a feature that is correlated with the functionality of MDR-related proteins. Moreover, after addition of MDR modulators a considerable increase in both uptake and retention of radiotracers in resistant cells is observed, which is consistent with the blockade of MDR transporters. Such evidence suggests that functional imaging with radiotracers might be able to predict the develop- ment of resistance to chemotherapy mediated by ABC transporters. In addi- tion, this approach provides an important tool to evaluate in vivo the efficacy of MDR modulators as an alternative to the ex vivo assays, in which the serum taken from patients receiving a modulator is assayed for its ability to reverse MDR in a Pgp-expressing cell line. The ability to obtain in vivo and non- invasively information at functional level of MDR-related transporters, using probes mimicking the antineoplastic agents is of great practical benefit for patients and offers a possibility of determining the individual tumor suscept- ibility to chemotherapy. This previous knowledge could serve as a critical tool for optimizing chemotherapeutic protocols on a patient-specific basis. The following sections of this chapter are focused on the potentialities of SPECT and PET for imaging drug resistance mechanisms mediated by the expression of ABC transporters in cancer. Initially, we will introduce the radiopharmaceuticals available for SPECT imaging, highlighting some of results obtained from clinical and pre-clinical studies. Second, an overview over the advances in PET radiopharma- ceuticals that are becoming available for studying MDR will be presented. 3 Functional Imaging of MDR 3.1 SPECT Imaging Agents 3.1.1 [99mTc]Sestamibi Several gamma-emitting compounds have been synthesized, validated, and characterized as sensitive probes for Pgp and MRP1 functional activity. Most of these compounds are cationic and modestly hydrophobic similar to the chemotherapeutic agents in the MDR phenotype. The radiopharmaceutical hexakis(2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile)technetium-99m commonly known as [99mTc]Sestamibi or [99mTc]MIBI (Cardiolite1) was the first imaging agent recognized as transport substrate of Pgp and the most widely used in clinical and pre-clinical studies for functional evaluation of MDR [53]. [99mTc]MIBI belongs to the class of 99mTc-labeled cationic and lipophilic compounds originally developed and clinically approved for myocardial perfusion studies. Subsequently, it has been used as a tumor-seeking agent in several malig- nancies [54,55]. This complex crosses the cell membranes by passive diffusion in Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 607 response to the physiologically negative transmembrane potential and accumulates reversibly within the mitochondria using the electrical gradient generated by the high negative inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential [56,57]. The difference in the transmembrane potential, of the mitochondria, between normal epithelial and carcinoma cells is at least 60 mV more negative in the latter due to the higher metabolic requirements of tumor cells [58]. According to the Nernst equation, this difference would lead to a 10-fold increase in the cellular uptake of lipophilic cations [59]. This is the principle for the superior accumulation of [99mTc]MIBI in tumor cells when compared to the epithelial or connective surrounding tissues. However, although cellular uptake of [99mTc]MIBI is driven by the plasma and mitochondrial membrane potentials, the overall accumulation of the tracer is inversely proportional to the expression levels of Pgp in tumor cells. The earlier observations that intracellular accumulation of [ 99mTc]MIBI varied widely among tumor cell lines [60] prompted several groups to explore the role of Pgp in transport kinetics of [ 99mTc]MIBI in tumor cells. Several studies performed in tumor cell lines exhibiting the MDR phenotype, either by selec- tion with cytotoxic agents or by transfection with the MDR recombinant transporters, generally showed a reduced net uptake of [99mTc]MIBI, a feature that is closely related with the outward transport activity of Pgp. Based on this principle, Pgp-overexpressing tumors can be detected in scinti- graphic images by their low uptake (‘‘cold’’ spot) and rapid washout rate from the tumor lesion, whereas drug-sensitive tumors translate into a higher uptake (‘‘hot’’ spot) with a slow washout rate of the radiotracer [61]. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, pre-clinical and clinical, have been performed in order to appraise the usefulness of [99mTc]MIBI imaging to identify Pgp-expressing tumors on a functional basis. After observing that [99mTc]MIBI accumulates in tumor cells in reverse ranking order of their Pgp expression levels, Piwnica-Worms et al. developed an animal model of human carcinoma for in vivo assessment of Pgp activity using [99mTc]MIBI [53]. The animal model was established by subcutaneous inoculation of human sensitive carcinoma cells KB-3-1 and its drug-resistant counterpart KB-8-5 in opposite flanks. Previous in vitro studies have shown that KB-8-5 cells overexpress Pgp are 3.2-fold resistant to adriamycin when compared to parental KB-3-1 cells [62]. A relative resistance of 2–2.5 for KB-8-5 tumors was documented by growth tumor analysis after treatment with adria- mycin, further supporting the maintenance of the MDR phenotype after the inoculation of the cells in mice. The analysis of scintigraphic images 60 min after injection of [99mTc]MIBI showed a lower accumulation of [99mTc]MIBI in Pgp- expressing tumors compared to the parental tumors implanted in the opposite flank [53]. The imaging results were confirmed with quantitative biodistribution analysis of the radiotracer in tumors. In Pgp-enriched tumors (KB-8-5), the [99mTc]MIBI accumulation was 35\u00024% lower than in parental sensitive tumors. Similar results were observed by Barbarics et al. [63] in an animal model of human breast cancer. The MDA 435 breast carcinoma cell line and 608 C.M.F. Gomes its paclitaxel-resistant derivatives, MDA/T0.1 (200-fold resistant) and MDA/T0.3 (300-fold resistant), were grown as xenografts in athymic mice to characterize the effects of chemotherapeutic agents in tumor growth. The MDA 435 parental cell line accumulated the highest percentage of the [ 99mTc]MIBI injected dose per gram of tissue. Compared with the parental xenografts, the resistant xenografts took up approximately 35–50% less [ 99mTc]MIBI. After treating the animals with the Pgp- inhibitor PSC833, the accumulation of [ 99mTc]MIBI in resistant tumors increased to the same levels found in parental MDA 435 xenografts. Nevertheless, the amount of PSC833 required to attain an amount of [ 99mTc]MIBI in MDA/T0.3 xenografts equivalent to those in MDA 435 xenografts was greater (100 mg/Kg) than that required for the MDA/T0.1 xenografts (50 mg/Kg), further indicating that PSC833 modulates Pgp activity in a dose-dependent manner. In a rat model with a doxorubicin-resistant and drug-sensitive rat breast adenocarcinomas xenografts, Ballinger et al. observed that [99mTc]MIBI was washed out from resistant tumor with a 3-fold higher efflux rate when com- pared with sensitive tumors, demonstrating that functional Pgp mediates the outward transport of [99mTc]MIBI, reducing its cellular accumulation [64]. In an attempt to determine the predictive value of [ 99mTc]MIBI imaging, Muzzammil et al. compared the kinetic profiles of [ 99mTc]MIBI and doxorubi- cin in three variants of the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF7: sensitive MCF7/WT, doxorubicin-selected MCF7/AdrR, and MDR1-gene-transfected MCF7/BC19 cells [65]. The effects of potent second-generation Pgp modulators GG918 and PSC833 were studied regarding the accumulation of both agents and the sensitivity of the cells to doxorubicin. Cellular accumulation of [99mTc]MIBI and mean fluorescence of doxorubicin were assessed over 60 min with and without modulators. The time course of the accumulation of [99mTc]MIBI and doxorubicin differed significantly among the three cell lines under control situation, as depicted in Fig 1. The two resistant sublines, Fig. 1 Time-course accumulation of [ 99mTc]MIBI (A) and doxorubicin (B) in MCF7/ WT, MCF7/BC19, and MCF7/AdrR cells (reprinted with permission from Macmillan Publishers, Ltd, Ref. [65]) Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 609 MCF7/AdrR and MCF7/BC19, showed a deficit in both [99mTc]MIBI and doxorubicin accumulations, when compared with the wild-type cells, indicating that both drugs are transport substrates of Pgp. However, the differences in uptake between sensitive and resistant cells were greater for [99mTc]MIBI than for doxorubicin, suggesting that other cell factors may affect differently the uptake and retention of these drugs. The MDR modulators, GG918 and PSC833, reversed the accumulation deficits of [ 99mTc]MIBI and doxorubicin in the MDR1-gene-transfected MCF7/BC19 cells to the MCF7/WT levels. For MCF7/AdrR cells, reversal of accumulation deficit was complete for doxorubicin but only partial for [99mTc]MIBI, suggesting that other cell factors present in MCF7/AdrR cells affect [99mTc]MIBI uptake more than doxorubicin. The resistant variant MCF7/AdrR was established through long-term exposure to doxorubicin. During drug selection, it is possible that changes in membrane, cytosolic and nuclear proteins, metabolic function, mitochondrial density, or membrane potential charge that affect uptake and retention of [99mTc]MIBI might occur, that are not reversed by Pgp modulators [53,66,67]. Supporting evidence for this explanation was the complete restoring of drug accumulation in MDR1-gene- transfected MCF7/BC19 cells, whose resistance mechanism was solely mediated by Pgp expression. Both Pgp inhibitors were effective in restoring doxorubicin and [99mTc]MIBI accumulation to the levels found in MCF7/WT cells. Moreover, PSC833 and GG918 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxor- ubicin in the two resistant cell lines. Even so, the MCF7/AdrR remained 2- to 5-fold more resistant when compared to MCF7/BC19 cells, despite the equal levels of doxorubicin fluorescence. In conclusion, both [ 99mTc]MIBI accumula- tion and doxorubicin flow cytometry techniques were able to detect Pgp- mediated MDR and its modulation, clearly distinguishing sensitive from resistant cell lines. Although [99mTc]MIBI and doxorubicin share the property of being substrates of Pgp, having similar affinity for Pgp-transport function, the radioisotope method appears to offer a better predictive value [65]. In vitro experiments demonstrated that reduced cellular uptake of [99mTc]MIBI is also related with overexpression of MRP1. Utsunomiya et al. studied the uptake and efflux kinetics of [99mTc]MIBI in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (CNE-1) [68]. Western blot and RT-PCR analysis indicated that these cells express moderate levels of both MRP1 and MRP2 but not Pgp. The maximal accumulation [99mTc]MIBI, calculated as the ratio of radioactiv- ity concentration inside the cell to that found in the supernatant (Cin/Cout), was 6.3 and increased significantly after inhibition with verapamil and CsA when compared with control. The efflux rate of [99mTc]MIBI diminished significantly after addition of verapamil or CsA that are both not selective for Pgp and exert inhibitor effects on MRP1 activity. Additionally, PSC833 and GG918 did not elicit significant alterations on the efflux rate [99mTc]MIBI due to their specifi- city for Pgp. The GSH-dependent transport of certain drugs and organic anions by MRP1 led several authors to investigate the role of GSH on the transport of 610 C.M.F. Gomes [99mTc]MIBI in MRP1-overexpressing cell lines. Prior to perform the radio- tracer kinetic studies, cells were pre-treated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) to reduce the intracellular content of GSH. BSO selectively inhibits g-glutamyl- cysteine synthetase (g-GCS), the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of GSH [20,21]. The treatment with BSO increased the uptake and retention of [99mTc]MIBI in four grade IV glioma cell lines, suggesting that transport of cationic radiotracers are carried out, in part, through the MRP1/GSH system [69]. These results were in agreement with those of Vergote [70] and Hendrikse [71] which showed that incubation with BSO induced a higher retention of [99mTc]MIBI in cells with enhanced expression of MRP1 but not in Pgp-over- expressing cells. This feature can be useful to discriminate between Pgp and MRP1 drug resistance mechanisms, as Pgp activity does not require GSH, and to evaluate the efficacy of GSH-depleting agents as well. GSH is a ubiquitous intracellular tri-peptide that plays a central role in cellular defense against toxic environmental agents and drugs [72]. Elevated levels of GSH have been impli- cated in cellular resistance to a wide range of cytotoxic drugs, in particular alkylating agents and platinum-containing compounds [73]. Modulation of cellular GSH homeostasis represents a potential strategy to sensitize tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs, an approach that could be of particular interest in MRP1 overexpressing tumor cells [20]. Experiments with MRP1-transfected cells showed that depletion of GSH results in a complete reversal of resistance to vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines [74], suggesting that changes in the intracel- lular levels of GSH have a marked effect on MRP1-mediated drug efflux for at least some of the drugs to which it conferred resistance. Our group studied the chemosensitivity of four human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2, 143B, MNNG/HOS, and U-2OS) to the main cytostatics used in the current protocols (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate). Our purpose was to determine whether there was a relationship between drug resistance, gene expression, and functional activity of MDR-related transporters [75]. None of the cell lines were previously exposed to drugs and therefore not selected for drug resistance. We found that chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cell lines to doxorubicin was strongly dependent on mRNA MDR1 gene expression and could be circumvented by adding a Pgp inhibitor (cyclosporine A). The radio- tracer’s kinetic parameters extracted from the uptake and efflux curves corre- lated with MDR1 expression levels, hence predicting resistance to doxorubicin. Moreover, addition of cyclosporin A at the same concentration as in drug reversal studies, increased significantly the radiotracer uptake and reduces the efflux rate in resistant cells, confirming for the active role of Pgp in the mechanism of resistance to doxorubicin (Fig. 2). These observations prompted our group to investigate the ability of [99mTc]MIBI imaging for in vivo identification of Pgp-mediated drug resistance. For that purpose, an orthotopic animal model of osteosarcoma was established by intratibial inoculation of osteosarcoma cell lines in nude mice [76]. Doxor- ubicin sensitive (143B) and resistant (MNNG/HOS) cell lines were stably transfected with the firefly luciferase to monitor the local tumor growth by Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 611 bioluminescence imaging. The formation of osteolytic lesions, typical of human osteosarcoma, was monitored by conventional radiography. After primary tumor growth, the animals were imaged with [ 99mTc]MIBI during 60 min. The kinetic parameters obtained from imaging analysis clearly discriminated sensi- tive from resistant tumors. Cellular accumulation of [ 99mTc]MIBI calculated in both early (5 min) and delayed (60 min) images was significantly higher (p<0.05) in 143B-sensitive tumors compared with that in MNNG-HOS-resis- tant tumors. A faster washout rate of [ 99mTc]MIBI was equally observed in MNNG-HOS-resistant tumors as demonstrated by the shorter washout half- times and higher percentage washout rate in MNNG/HOS-resistant tumors (t1/2=87.3\u000215.7 min; %WR= 37.5\u00024.0) when compared with those in 143B- sensitive tumors (t1/2=161.0\u000247.4 min; %WR= 24.6\u00027.5 %). Fig. 2 (A) Chemosensitivity of a human osteosarcoma cell line (MNNG/HOS) to doxorubicin and reversal of drug resistance. Cells were treated for 24 h with doxorubicin at indicated concentrations with and without 5 mM CsA. The percentage of dead cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The MNNG/HOS cell line showed a high resistance to doxorubicin, with a low and invariable percentage of dead cells. After incubation with CsA, at non-toxic concentration, the percentage of dead cells increased linearly in dose-dependent manner. (B) Effects of CsA on uptake and efflux kinetics of [ 99mTc]MIBI in MNNG/HOS cells. The same dose of CsA as in drug reversal study caused a 4-fold increase in the steady-state accumulation of [ 99mTc]MIBI and enhanced significantly the intracellular retention of the radiotracer as demonstrated by the slower efflux rate as compared with the control. The mRNA analysis of MDR-related genes has revealed that the MDR1 gene is up-regulated in the MNNG/HOS cell line 612 C.M.F. Gomes The treatment of animals with the Pgp-inhibitor PSC833 increased signifi- cantly the washout half-times of [ 99mTc]MIBI in MNNG/HOS-resistant tumors (t1/2=173.0\u000224.5 min) to values comparable to those in 143B-sensitive tumors in control situation. However, no significant increase was observed in [ 99mTc]MIBI uptake in MNNG/HOS tumors, indicating that the uptake-related parameter is not a consistent index to evaluate the inhibitor efficacy of PSC833 [76]. Figure 3 illustrates a representative bioluminescent image of a mouse inoculated with osteosarcoma cells carrying a luciferase reporter gene into the right tibia and the early and delayed scintigraphic images acquired in the absence and in the presence of PSC833. The formation of osteolytic lesions, typical of osteosarcoma, was detected radiographically 3–4 weeks after the inoculation of tumor cells. The results obtained in vivo were largely consistent with those observed in vitro and suggest that Pgp expression is determinant on the chemosensitivity of tumor cells to doxorubicin, an important cytostatic used in the treatment of osteosarcoma, and can be detected non-invasively by [ 99mTc]MIBI imaging. According to these results, the uptake parameter is not so robust as the wash- out-related parameters to evaluate the functional activity of Pgp expressed in tumors, since [99mTc]MIBI is not target specific and its uptake is markedly 5 min 60 min C 60 min 5 min D B A Fig. 3 (A) Bioluminescent image of nude mouse 4 weeks after intratibial inoculation of osteo- sarcoma cells carrying a luciferase reporter gene. (B) Radiograph taken at 4 weeks shows the formation of osteolytic lesions in the corresponding region. [ 99mTc]MIBI images acquired at early (5 min) and delayed times (60 min) in the absence (C) and after treatment with PSC833 (D). The treatment with 50 mg/kg PSC833 increased both the uptake and the retention of [ 99mTc]MIBI in the tumor region Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 613 influenced by several factors rather than simply Pgp activity. The enhanced washout of [ 99mTc]MIBI appears to be a more reliable index of Pgp activity and a better predictor of drug resistance, since it reflects the Pgp-mediated outward transport. Inefficient blood supply, advanced cell necrosis, hypoxia, and the overex- pression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 may significantly reduce the uptake of [99mTc]MIBI in tumor lesions [77]. An adequate blood supply is a prerequi- site for the effective delivery of [ 99mTc]MIBI to the tumoral mass. Mankoff et al. studied the influence of tumor blood supply using 15O-water PET imaging on [99mTc]MIBI uptake in 37 patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma and found a significant positive correlation between early uptake and blood flow [78]. For instance, tumors containing necrotic areas accompanied by an inefficient blood supply and the occurrence of hypoxic cells can change the kinetics of [99mTc]MIBI, decreasing its intracellular accumulation, which can provide false-positive results regarding Pgp expression in tumor cells. In the absence of factors limiting the free diffusion of [99mTc]MIBI from blood to tumor cells, the early [99mTc]MIBI uptake reflects the density and the func- tional status of mitochondria namely the permeability of mitochondrial mem- brane and the preservation of the membrane potential [79]. During the early stages of drug-induced apoptosis there is an increase in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane under the control of the Bcl-2 protein family resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and dissipation of mitochondrial poten- tials. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane that prevents cells from entering the apoptotic process. The over- expression of Bcl-2 in tumor cells prevents the permeabilization of mitochon- drial membrane and the release of cytochrome c and other soluble proteins triggered by death signals protecting tumor cells from drug-induced apoptosis. This effect also impairs the trafficking of lipophilic cations across the mito- chondrial membrane, reducing its accumulation within mitochondria. This evidence was further observed by Del Vecchio et al. in breast cancer patients [80]. They found that tumors who failed to accumulate [99mTc]MIBI have a low apoptotic index and a marked overexpression on Bcl-2. This relationship was further observed in vitro in breast cancer cell lines stably transfected with the human Bcl-2 gene [81]. All clones overexpressing Bcl-2 showed a dramatic reduction, up to 97% of [ 99mTc]MIBI accumulation as compared with wild- type and mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, after treatment with stauros- porine, a potent inducer of apoptosis, [99mTc]MIBI uptake was partially restored in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells. Levels of Bcl-2 in transfected clones, as determined by immunohistochemistry, were elevated and in the range mea- sured in tumors who failed to accumulate [99mTc]MIBI. Conversely, tumors with high in vivo uptake of [99mTc]MIBI showed only barely detectable levels of Bcl-2 (Fig. 4). The biological information provided by an absent or a reduced accumula- tion of [99mTc]MIBI in early images may be related to different cellular processes and should be carefully interpreted. The lack of [99mTc]MIBI uptake 614 C.M.F. Gomes in malignant lesions can be indicative of a non-permeable mitochondrial membrane to [99mTc]MIBI due to high expression levels of Bcl-2 or can be related with the presence of Pgp or other efflux pumps. Although both conditions constitute a drug resistance mechanism and help tumor cells to evade chemotherapy, it is important to discriminate between them in order to define the suitable approach for circumventing drug resistance. Fig. 4 (A) Lateral view scintimammograms obtained 10 min after i.v. injection of 740 MBq of [ 99mTc]MIBI in two patients with untreated breast carcinoma. On the left, high focal [ 99mTc]MIBI uptake was observed in a 2 cm ductal carcinoma (tumor 2) of the upper external quadrant of the right breast. On the right,no[ 99mTc]MIBI uptake was observed in a 3 cm ductolobular carcinoma (tumor 3) of the upper external quadrant of the left breast. (B) Bcl-2 levels determined by western blot analysis in breast carcinomas obtained from patients who had previously undergone [ 99mTc]MIBI scan as described above. Two tumors (nos. 1 and 2) had high focal 99mTc-MIBI uptake in vivo and the other two (nos. 3 and 4) showed no 99mTc-MIBI uptake on scintigraphic images. Tumors with high in vivo [99mTc]MIBI uptake (nos. 1 and 2) showed only barely detectable levels of Bcl-2 protein, whereas the two tumors with no tracer uptake on scintigraphic images (nos. 3 and 4) showed high levels of Bcl-2 protein comparable to those found in the Bcl-2 overexpressing clone MCF-7 (reprinted by permission from Springer Science+Business Media, Ref. [81]) Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 615 Clinical Studies with [99mTc]MIBI The clinical relevance of [ 99mTc]MIBI imaging in predicting chemotherapy response has been investigated in diverse malignancies including breast cancer, lung tumors, osteosarcoma, lymphomas, and hepatocelular carcinoma. In gen- eral, [ 99mTc]MIBI kinetic parameters extracted from image analysis are corre- lated with the expression levels of Pgp and/or MRP1, detected at gene or protein level in the tumor specimen, and with tumor response to chemotherapy. A significant number of studies were conducted in breast cancer patients, since [ 99mTc]MIBI scintimammography is currently used as an auxiliary method in the diagnosis of breast cancer. A review of the published literature revealed that 41% of patients with breast cancers express Pgp at presentation, with increased levels after chemotherapy [82]. Moreover, the expression of Pgp, especially when detected following therapy, correlates with a worst prognosis in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapies, being considered a potential biomarker of drug resistance [4,82]. The first clinical studies planned to determine whether [ 99mTc]MIBI imaging could detect in vivo the presence of Pgp in breast tumors examined the relationship between [ 99mTc]MIBI uptakeand theexpression of Pgp assessed by immunohistochemistry. Kostakoglu et al. observed an inverse correlation between the tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios of [ 99mTc]MIBI and the density of Pgp expression in tumor tissues [83]. The values for the T/B ratios were significantly lower for those tumors expressing Pgp at high levels than those with scattered and no Pgp expression (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). In a prospective study, Kao et al. evaluated the relationship between the degree of accumulation of [ 99mTc]MIBI and Pgp or MRP1 expression in 48 patients with infiltrating ductal breast cancer [84]. The tumors with positive expression of Pgp and MRP1 showed the lowest T/B ratios (1.13\u00020.10), whereas the tumors with negative expression Pgp and MRP1 had the highest T/B ratios (2.17\u00020.14). A significant negative correlation has been observed between net uptake of [ 99mTc]MIBI and Pgp expression levels in tumor lesions; however, it was not proven any time dependence on this relationship. Del Vecchio et al. performed a radiotracer kinetic analysis over 4 hours following injection of [99mTc]MIBI in 30 untreated breast carcinoma patients [85]. The results showed a statistically positive correlation between radiotracer efflux rate and Pgp expression levels. The efflux rate of [ 99mTc]MIBI in Pgp- overexpressing tumors was 2.7-fold greater than that of tumors expressing Pgp at levels comparable to benign breast lesions. A threshold value corresponding to a half-clearance of 204 min was established to discriminate Pgp-overexpres- sing tumors from those with basal expression levels, with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the efflux rate constants of [ 99mTc]MIBI reflect the functional activity of Pgp and could be used to predict chemotherapy response of breast cancer patients. This hypoth- esis was further investigated in other studies. Ciarmiello et al. analyzed whether tumor clearance of [99mTc]MIBI may be predictive of therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer [86]. 616 C.M.F. Gomes Tumors with a prolonged retention of [ 99mTc]MIBI exhibited a favorable response to chemotherapy. In opposite, a rapid clearance of [99mTc]MIBI was significantly associated with a lack of tumor response to neoadjuvante che- motherapy as demonstrated by the presence of residual tumor in surgical speci- mens. Sciuto et al. reported similar results in a prospective study with 30 patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant che- motherapy [8]. On this study, the washout rate of [99mTc]MIBI was calculated using the T/B ratios in early (10 min) and delayed (4 h) images as follows: (T/B10 min–T/B4h)/T/B10 min\u0003100 (%). A cut-off of 45% was considered statistically discriminative between good and poor responders. Twelve of 30 patients who responded favorably to chemotherapy had a washout rate less than or equal to 45%. Conversely, the remaining 18 patients that have failed to respond to chemotherapy had a washout rate superior to 45%. In a retrospective study including 46 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, Takamura et al. evaluated the significance of [99mTc]MIBI uptake in early and delayed images in predicting tumor response to chemotherapy with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide or docetaxel [87]. Before starting chemotherapy, the patients underwent a [99mTc]MIBI SPECT study. The parameters extracted from SPECT images were the tumor-to-nor- mal tissue ratios (T/N) of [99mTc]MIBI uptake at 10 min (early phase) and at 180 min (delayed phase) and the retention index (RI) was calculated as follows: RI=(T/N(d))/(T/N(e)). After chemotherapy, tumor response was determined by clinical examination. Both early T/N(e) and delayed T/N(d) uptake ratios were significantly higher for patients who responded to chemotherapy than for non-responders. The diagnostic accuracy of the T/N(d) in predicting chemotherapy response using the arbitrary cut-off value of 3.0 was 89.1% with a positive and a negative predictive value of 81.0 and 96.0%, respectively. Although significant, the relationship between T/N(e) ratio and response to chemotherapy was less pronounced probably because the early phase of [ 99mTc]MIBI uptake is affected by other factors than the expression of Pgp, such as the blood flow to the tumor. Representative [99mTc]MIBI studies are shown in Fig. 5. The tumor retention index (RI) was not statistically different between responders and non-responders who seem to be attributable, at least in part, to the finding that RI was calculated using the T/N(e) ratio that is influenced by other factors than Pgp. The expression levels of Pgp, determined by immunohistochemistry in tumor specimens prior to treatment, was significantly higher in lesions with low T/B(d) ratios when compared with those with high values, indicating that [99mTc]MIBI extrusion is accelerated in Pgp-expressing tumors. Moreover, the higher expres- sion of Pgp was found in non-responders (Fig. 6). The results from this study suggest that the T/B ratio of [99mTc]MIBI at delayed times is useful to predict response to chemotherapy and for in vivo evaluation of Pgp expression status in patients with locally advanced or recurrent breast carcinoma. Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 617 Lung tumors represent another malignancy in which the expression of MDR-related transporters is associated with a poor prognosis [88–90]. Several studies have been published on the prognostic value of [ 99mTc]MIBI imaging in predicting chemotherapy response and its relationship with Pgp and/or MRP1 expression. Analysis of tumor retention and washout rates of [ 99mTc]MIBI by comparing early and delayed SPECT and planar images have been performed and correlated with the expression levels of Pgp and MRP1. The relation of those parameters with therapy response was also analyzed in some studies. Fig. 5 Representative [ 99mTc]MIBI SPECT scintimammograms obtained at 10 min (early phase) and 180 min (delayed phase) after i.v. injection of [ 99mTc]MIBI responder (A and B) and non-responder (C and D) patients (reprinted with permission of Wiley-Liss, Inc., a subsidiary of John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Ref. [87]) Fig. 6 Relation between chemotherapeutic response and T/N(e) ratios (A), T/N(d) ratios (B), retention index (RI) (C), and Pgp expression levels (D) in breast carcinoma patients. N.S.: not significant (reprinted with permission of Wiley-Liss, Inc., a subsidiary of John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Ref. [87]) 618 C.M.F. Gomes In a prospective study with a total of 46 patients with lung tumors, Kostakoglu et al. correlated the accumulation and washout rate of [99mTc]MIBI with the levels of Pgp expression determined by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections [91]. All patients underwent early (30 min) and delayed (3 h) [99mTc]MIBI imaging and bronchoscopic biopsy before initiation of chemo- or radiotherapy. They found a significant inverse correlation (p=0.001) between the T/B ratios and the density of Pgp expression, whereas no appreciable correlation (p=0.414) was observed between the [99mTc]MIBI washout rate and the Pgp expression levels. Current data strongly suggest that, although the reduced ability for the tumors to accumulate [ 99mTc]MIBI correlates well with the increased levels of Pgp expression, tumor washout rates of [ 99mTc]MIBI do not correlate with the density of Pgp in tumor tissues. Bom et al. observed similar results in 25 patients with SCLC [92]. In this study, they calculated the T/B ratios at 1 and 4 h after injection of [ 99mTc]MIBI and the percent retention as follows: %R = (T/B4h)/(T/B1h)\u0003100. The results were correlated with tumor response to chemotherapy evaluated according to follow-up CT and grouped as complete remission, partial remission, and no remission. The T/B ratios of patients with complete and partial remission were significantly higher compared with patients with no remission. However, the percent retention of radiotracer between 1 and 4 h did not differ significantly among the three groups. Assuming that Pgp acts as an active drug efflux pump mediating drug-outward transport, one would expect a close connection between Pgp expression and enhanced washout rate of Pgp substrates from the tumor. In both studies, they were unable to detect an active efflux mechanism associated with the considerable reduction in [99mTc]MIBI accumulation in Pgp-positive samples. This could be accepted if Pgp acts as a ‘‘flippase’’ transporting drugs from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer to the outer or to the external medium preventing drugs to accumulate within the cell. In this context, %W-O rates are not supposed to be affected dramatically by Pgp. Another explanation for the lack of correlation between [99mTc]MIBI retention and Pgp expression could be related with the time points used to derive the washout rates. In these studies, they measured the percent of change in tumor activity between 30 or 60 min and 4 h following injection of radiotracer. Probably 30 min is too late to be considered as a reference time, since active efflux occurs rapidly and might take place imme- diately following injection. Zhou et al. in a study including 34 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer underwent [ 99mTc]MIBI SPECT followed by surgery [93]. The early and delayed SPECT images were acquired at 15 and 180 min, respectively, after injection of [ 99mTc]MIBI. Sample tumors were analyzed by immunohistochem- istry and RT-PCR for expression of Pgp and MRP1. The delayed uptake (at 180 min) and the efflux rate of [ 99mTc]MIBI (between 15 and 180 min) correlates significantly with the expression levels of Pgp. Such correlations were not observed in relation to the early tumor uptake, which suggests that early uptake is more affected by blood flow. Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 619 Neither the early and delayed uptakes nor the washout rate of [ 99mTc]MIBI was correlated with the MRP1 expression levels in tumor lesions. The ability of Pgp and MRP1 to wash out [ 99mTc]MIBI from tumor cells has been reported to be similar, in spite of their different transport mechanisms. The GSH dependence of MRP1- mediated transport might be the basis for this discrepancy. The intracellular levels of GSH and glutathione-S-transferase (GST, the enzyme that catalyzes the GSH conjugation reaction) are essential for the transport function of MRP1. GSH levels have been shown to be elevated in a number of different human cancer tissues including bone marrow, breast, colon, and lungs [94]. Therefore, the role of MRP1 in promoting drug resistance should not be dissociated from the GSH/GST intra- cellular levels. The same is applicable for the measurements of MRP1 activity with [ 99mTc]MIBI, since both uptake and efflux of [ 99mTc]MIBI depend on the GSH content in MRP1 overexpressing cells as demonstrated in several in vitro studies. In another study, Akgun et al. correlated the uptake of [99mTc]MIBI and its retention in delayed images with response to multiagent chemotherapy in 40 SCLC patients [30]. The authors also investigated if there was any relationship between the survival time and the [ 99mTc]MIBI kinetic parameters at the time of diagnosis. Of the 40 patients, 29 were classified as good responders (complete or partial remission) and 11 as non-responders (stable disease or progressive disease). Following i.v. administration of [99mTc]MIBI, SPECT imaging at 30 min (early) and 2 h (delayed) was performed. Regions of interest were placed over the tumors and contralateral normal lung tissue on one transverse section. Uptake ratios between lesions and contralateral normal lung were obtained from early images (early ratio; ER) as well as delayed images (delayed ratio; DR). The retention index (RI%) was measured as RI% = [(DR-ER)/ ER]\u0003100. [99mTc]MIBI tumor uptake parameters were compared with che- motherapeutic response and survival time. The RI of [ 99mTc]MIBI in good responders was significantly higher than that in poor responders (p<0.05). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to uptake in both early (30 min) and delayed (2 h) times. The patient survival time varied from 1 to 70 months with a mean survival time of 12.9 \u0002 13.4 months. There were no significant differences between the survival time of patients with respect to early or delayed uptake of [99mTc]MIBI. A cut-off value of 3.85% for RI provided a satisfactory discrimination between patients according to the survival time. Patients with a RI higher than 3.85% had a longer survival time (12 months) than those with lower RI (8 months), p<0.05. The authors concluded that the retention index of [99mTc]MIBI, between 30 min and 2 h, could accurately predict the chemotherapy response in patients with SCLC and may be helpful in predicting survival in this pathology. To date, a few reports have been published on the prognostic value of [99mTc]MIBI imaging in predicting chemotherapy response in osteosarcoma, the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. The survival rate among patients with osteosarcoma is not encouraging despite the advances in treatments including multiagent chemotherapy regimens in combination with surgery. Systemic relapses are observed in 25–50% of 620 C.M.F. Gomes patients without metastases at diagnosis, mostly related to poor response to chemotherapy [95–97]. Among the different prognostic factors identified so far, the overexpression of Pgp is frequently associated with drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and poor outcome [5,98,99]. Other studies have failed to confirm this relationship and the role of Pgp as a prognostic marker remains contro- versial [34,100]. The results obtained from imaging studies with [99mTc]MIBI in relation to Pgp expression were equally contradictory. Burak et al. analyzed the role of [ 99mTc]MIBI scintigraphy for functional imaging of the MDR phenotype in patients with musculoskeletal sarcomas [101]. They compared the uptake and the washout kinetics of [99mTc]MIBI with Pgp expression levels and tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The tumor-to-background ratios of [ 99mTc]MIBI calculated either in early (10 min) or in delayed (60 min) images did not differ significantly between patients with high and low expression of Pgp. Conversely, the washout rate of [99mTc]MIBI, calculated between 10 and 60 min, was correlated with the degree of Pgp expression and was higher in patients with higher levels of Pgp than in those with a low Pgp score. According to the authors, the early images may not be sufficient to evaluate the expression of Pgp in bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, and a delayed imaging acquisition is recommended to determine the washout rate of [99mTc]MIBI. The optimal time for delayed imaging varies widely between studies. Most reports favor acquisition of the late images at least 2 h post-injection. In this study, 1 h late imaging was enough to identify differences in the washout rate of [ 99mTc]MIBI between patients with high and low expres- sion of Pgp. After neoadjuvant therapy, tumor response was assessed by determining the percentage of necrosis and stratified into good responders (\u000490% necrosis) and no responders (<90% necrosis). Neither the expression of Pgp nor the washout rate of [99mTc]MIBI correlates significantly with the level of tumor necrosis. The absence of a relationship between the Pgp expres- sion and the degree of necrosis is not unexpected since the multiagent che- motherapy regimens include doxorubicin, which is a Pgp substrate but also cisplatin and methotrexate that act independently of Pgp. Additionally, although the classical MDR phenotype in musculoskeletal sarcomas has been associated to Pgp, the expression of other ABC transporters, such as MRP1, should not be excluded. MRP1 confers resistance to a large drug spectrum and, as already mentioned, [99mTc]MIBI is a substrate for both Pgp and MRP1. A representative case of a patient with osteosarcoma located in the right distal femur is presented in Fig. 7. The T/B ratio derived from early (10 min) and delayed images (60 min) was 4.89 and 4.29, respectively, corresponding to a percentage washout rate of 12%. After neoadjuvant therapy, tumor regressed completely and the patient was classified as a good responder. The scintigraphy performed after treatment showed no [99mTc]MIBI uptake at the primary lesion. Surprisingly, the immunostaining of Pgp in tumor specimen was very strong, disaccording from the scintigraphic data and therapeutic response. The uncoupling between the Pgp expression and the level of its action could be the basis for this discordance. The suboptimal functional capacity of the Pgp efflux Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 621 pump due to low levels of the ATP content could generate conflicting results. To avoid false-positive results, the immunohistochemical detection of Pgp should be complemented with a functional assay. The same group, in an independent study, investigated the role of MRP1 in drug resistance in osteosarcoma and evaluated the capability of functional imaging with [ 99mTc]MIBI for recognizing MRP1 expression [10]. They also examined whether kinetic parameters would help to distinguish between Pgp and MRP1 expressions. Fifteen of 24 osteosarcoma samples (62.5%) showed high levels of MRP1, 13 showed strong Pgp expression (54.2%) and 10 (41.2%) showed co-expression of both proteins (MRP1 and Pgp). Again a significant correlation between the T/B ratios and the expression of either MRP1 or Pgp was not observed. The early or delayed T/B ratios of patients with high expression of these proteins were not significantly different from those with low expression. The washout rate of [ 99mTc]MIBI was significantly correlated with the expression levels of MRP1, being higher in patients with high expression of MRP1 (30.1\u00028.6%) than in those with low expression (20.0\u00027.7%, p=0.007). A cut-off of 22% was defined to distinguish between cases with fast and slow [ 99mTc]MIBI clearance. The histological response to multiagent chemotherapy based on analysis of necrosis percentage was significantly correlated with the MRP1 immunostaining and with thewashoutrateof[ 99mTc]MIBI. The comparative analysis of [ 99mTc]MIBI wash- out rate between patients with co-expression of MRP1 and Pgp and patients with high expression of either Pgp or MRP1 showed that it is not possible to distinguish between MRP1 and Pgp expression in osteosarcoma, suggesting that [ 99mTc]MIBI should be actively pumped out by Pgp and MRP1 with similar efficiency. Although MRP1 differs from Pgp with respect to substrate characteristics and transport mechanisms, there is a considerable overlapping in their substrate specificity. Therefore, the overexpression of MRP1 in Pgp-negative tumors should be explored as an alternative mechanism of resistance. Fig. 7 A 13-years-old boy with osteosarcoma located in the right distal femur. Both early (A) and delayed (B) images acquired at 10 and 60 min, respectively, showed intense uptake of [ 99mTc]MIBI in the tumor lesion. The percent washout rate at 60 min was of 12%. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there was no [99mTc]MIBI uptake at the primary lesion site (C). The percent necrosis of the resection material was 99% and the patient showed complete response to chemotherapy (reprinted by permission from Springer Science+Business Media, Ref. [101]) 622 C.M.F. Gomes Contrary to the above analysis, Gorlick et al. reported a lack of correlation of [ 99mTc]MIBI kinetics with both histological response to neoadjuvant che- motherapy and measurements of Pgp expression in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma [102]. A large variability was observed in the biological half-lives of [ 99mTc]MIBI ranging between 1.4 and 52.5 h in the cohort of patients imaged. Although the mean biological half-lives of [99mTc]MIBI has been higher in tumors without Pgp expression (13.2 h) compared with those expressing Pgp (4.4 h), the relationship was not statistically significant (p=0.19). The same was observed in relation with Huvos grade. Tumors with a favorable extension of necrosis following induction chemotherapy had a mean biological half-life of 13.7 h, whereas tumor with less necrosis had a mean biological half-life of 8.1 h. The extent of necrosis was not correlated with the expression levels of Pgp measured either by immunohistochemistry or by quantitative RT-PCR, sug- gesting that Pgp could not serve as a prognostic factor in osteosarcoma. A concern raised by this study was also the lack of correlation between the two measurements of Pgp expression assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and immu- nohistochemistry (p=0.33) suggesting that special attention should be paid for the methodology used when assessing Pgp expression. In this study, the authors did not consider the expression of MRP1 instead of Pgp in these lesions, which could explain some conflicting results. A few studies have been focused on the role of [99mTc]MIBI planar scinti- graphy in predicting chemotherapy response in hematological diseases. A pre- liminary report by Liang et al. in a group of 25 patients with malignant lymphoma showed that the mean early T/B ratio of 15 patients with good response (3.3\u00020.6) was significantly higher than that of the 10 patients with poor response (1.2\u00020.1) [103]. All the 15 patients with good response had negative Pgp expression. Among the 10 patients who presented a poor response to chemotherapy and had negative [99mTc]MIBI scan, only 6 were Pgp-positive. The negative [99mTc]MIBI scan in the four cases with negative Pgp expression may also be related with the MRP1 expression, an aspect that was not analyzed in this study. The differences observed in response to chemotherapy were not correlated with other prognostic factors such as tumor type, tumor stage, or patients’ age. Therefore, early [99mTc]MIBI scan appears to predict more accu- rately, compared with other prognostic factors, chemotherapy response in patients with malignant lymphoma. Ak et al. analyzed the relationship between the [99mTc]MIBI uptake and the expression levels of Pgp in 26 patients with newly diagnosed leukemia [104]. The patients underwent a [ 99mTc]MIBI whole-body planar imaging prior to che- motherapy. Planar images of pelvis and thorax were acquired 20 min post- injection of [99mTc]MIBI. The T/B ratio in bone marrow was compared with the Pgp expression in blast cells from bone marrow aspiration samples determined by flow cytometry. The results of [99mTc]MIBI imaging were concordant with the Pgp expression levels found in blast cells. The bone marrow uptake of [99mTc]MIBI was significantly (p<0.001) higher in Pgp-negative patients than in those with Pgp-positive blast cells. Such observations indicate that in vivo Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 623 functional imaging of bone marrow with [99mTc]MIBI could provide functional valuable information regarding Pgp activity in untreated patients with leukemia. 3.1.2 [99mTc]Tetrofosmin [99mTc]Tetrofosmin is another lipophilic cationic compound proposed for func- tional imaging of MDR. It is a diphosphine complex of 99mTc also developed and approved for clinical use in myocardial perfusion studies. The cellular accumulation and retention of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin is similar to that of [99mTc]MIBI involving passive diffusion through the cell membrane in response to the negative transmembrane potential and sequestration in mitochondria. The similarity with [99mTc]MIBI prompted researchers to investigate whether [99mTc]Tetrofosmin could provide information on the functional activity of MDR-related transporters. The transport kinetics of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin has been characterized in mammalian cell lines expressing different levels of ABC transporters. Studies from Ballinger et al. in a rat breast carcinoma wild-type cell line, MatB/wt, and its doxorubicin-selected variant expressing Pgp, MatB/ AdrR, demonstrated that wild-type cells accumulate 16-fold more [ 99mTc]Te- trofosmin than the resistant variant MatB/AdrR [105]. Furthermore, addition of PSC833 1 mM increased nine times the cellular uptake of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin in resistant MatB/AdrR cells without significant changes in parental MatB/wt cells. Similar results were observed in human breast carcinoma MCF7/wt and MCF7/AdrR cell line pair [105]. A comparative study of transport kinetics between [99mTc]MIBI and [99mTc]Tetrofosmin in drug-sensitive cells and its resistant counterparts demon- strated that functional activity of Pgp can be detected with equal sensitivity with both radiotracers. The steady-state accumulation of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin in a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB 3-1 (59.4\u00023.0 fmol/mg protein) and its colchicine-resistant derivative KB 8-5 (1.9\u00020.06 fmol/mg protein) were approximately half of the values obtained for [99mTc]MIBI in the same cells (104.6\u00024.1 and 2.85\u00020.1 fmol/mg protein, respectively). Nevertheless the ratio of cell accumulation (KB 3-1/KB 8-5) for [99mTc]Tetrofosmin (43.7) was similar to that obtained for [99mTc]MIBI (37.4), suggesting that both tracers could detect Pgp expression with the same efficacy. The lower cellular accumulation of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin compared with [99mTc]MIBI was systematically reported in independent studies with different resistant cell lines [68,75], a fact that is probability related with the individual characteristics of each radiotracer. In fact, despite having similar characteristics, these tracers are not identical. [99mTc]Tetrofosmin is less sensitive than [99mTc]MIBI to the electric transmem- brane potentials generated in living cells. Moreover, whereas [99mTc]MIBI accumulates preferentially in mitochondria, [99mTc]Tetrofosmin remains in cytoplasm and only a small part is sequestered in mitochondria. Several studies performed in a battery of cell lines expressing MRP1 but not Pgp clearly demonstrated that [99mTc]Tetrofosmin is also a substrate of MRP1. 624 C.M.F. Gomes Overall, cell lines overexpressing MRP1 showed a deficit in the cellular accu- mulation of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin, compared with their sensitive counterparts, and enhancement of radiotracer net content was observed upon addition of modulators of MRP1 transport activity such as verapamil, cyclosporin A, or probenecid [68,106]. Addition of Pgp-specific modulators (PSC833, GF120918, LY335979) did not alter the accumulation of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin in MRP1- overexpressing cells. As observed for [99mTc]MIBI, the transport of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin by MRP1 can be modulated through depletion of GSH. Several groups observed an increase in the intracellular accumulation of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin in MRP1- overexpressing cell lines after depletion of GSH with BSO treatment [68,106,107]. These results indicate that net cell accumulation of [99mTc]Tetro- fosmin is functionally affected by MRP1, which is, in turn, dependent on cellular levels of GSH. Clinical Studies with [99mTc]Tetrofosmin The clinical usefulness of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin scintigraphy for in vivo prediction of MDR has been demonstrated in some malignancies. The tumor uptake and washout indexes of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin have proved to be useful in detecting Pgp/MRP1 expression in tumor lesions and predicting chemotherapy response. In a study of 30 patients with infiltrating ductal breast cancer, Sun et al. suggested that [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin is as capable as [99mTc]MIBI in detecting Pgp expression [108]. The tumor-to-background ratio in 12 patients with posi- tive expression of Pgp was 1.20\u00020.12, significantly lower (p<0.05) than that in 18 Pgp-negative patients (1.94\u00020.30). [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin has proved to be useful in predicting chemotherapy response in patients with lung cancer. Thirty patients with untreated lung carcinoma underwent a [99mTc]Tetrofosmin SPECT before starting chemotherapy. The scans were acquired at 10 and 120 min after injection of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin. The retention index of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin between 10 and 120 min was predictive of tumor response to chemotherapy. Fourteen of the 18 patients with high retention (>15%) exhibited a favorable response to chemotherapy, whereas all the 12 tumors with a [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin retention lower than 15% did not respond to che- motherapy [109]. Shiau et al. evaluated the prognostic value of [99mTc]Tetro- fosmin in predicting chemotherapy response to paclitaxel in 20 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer [110]. The response to chemotherapy was evaluated by clinical and radiological methods in the third month after comple- tion of the treatment. The T/B ratio, in early and delayed images of patients with good response, was significantly higher than in patients with poor response. The immunohistochemical analysis of Pgp identified high levels of Pgp in biopsy specimens of poor responders. Such observations emphasize the ability of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin chest imaging in predicting tumor response to paclitaxel. Kao and colleagues evaluated the correlation of [99mTc]Tetrofosmin uptake with Pgp and/or MRP1 expression in small-cell lung cancer [111], Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 625 malignant lymphoma [112], and parathyroid adenoma [113]. All studies revealed that tumor uptake of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin depends essentially on Pgp and/or MRP1 expression in tumor cells and therefore could be used to identify those patients that are most likely to fail chemotherapy. Yapar et al. demonstrated the ability of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin scintigraphy for detecting Pgp expression in patients with malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors [114]. The percentage washout rate of the tracer, calculated between 15 and 90 min, was correlated with the degree of Pgp expression and was higher in lesions with higher levels of Pgp (31.81\u00026.72%) than in those with a low Pgp score (21.0\u00023.49%). A cut-off value of 24.5% provided a good discrimination between lesions with and with- out Pgp expression with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 100%. On the other hand, [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin uptake was not correlated with Pgp expression, suggesting that Pgp is not the major factor interfering with the uptake of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin in these lesions [114]. The inability of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin uptake in detecting Pgp expression in malignant musculoskeletal tumors had already been reported in a previous study [115]. The tumor-to-background ratio of [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin in tumor lesions expressing Pgp (3.01\u00021.48) was not statistically different from those not expressing Pgp (4.27\u00022.90). 3.2 PET Imaging Agents A number of PET-based radiopharmaceuticals have been actively developed to probe the functional activity of Pgp in tumors. These tracers were developed through the incorporation of short-lived positron emitters, such as carbon-11 ( 11C; t1/2=20.3 min) or fluorine-18 ( 18F, t1/2=110 min), into organic molecules characterized as substrates or modulators of Pgp. Radiolabeling with 11Chas the advantage of not altering the biochemical and pharmacological properties of the compounds, as it can replace any C atom present in the molecule, but its use is restricted to centers with a cyclotron that can produce the nuclide. Fluorine-18 has a longer half-life and can be transported from the production facility to nearby centers. In some cases, fluorine-containing compounds, such as 5-fluouracil, can be labeled isotopically but 18F is by far more commonly used to replace a hydro- gen atom on a prospective tracer as it shares a similar van der Waal’s radius with H and produces very little physicochemical effects on the labeled molecules. 3.2.1 11C-Labeled Compounds The first 11C-labeled compound synthesized for functional imaging of MDR was the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) which is a well-known substrate of Pgp. In vitro experiments with human ovarian carcinoma cell lines showed a 16-fold higher accumulation of [ 11C]DNR in sensitive cells (A2780) as compared with the resistant Pgp-overexpressing counterpart (A2780AD) [116]. After treatment with verapamil, the accumulation of [ 11C]DNR in Pgp-overexpressing cells increased to the levels found in sensitive cells further demonstrating the influence of Pgp on transport kinetics of [ 11C]DNR. The ability of [ 11C]DNR, in tracer 626 C.M.F. Gomes dosages, to distinguish sensitive from resistant tumors was equally observed in tumor-bearing rats with a PET camera [117]. For these studies rats were inocu- lated with a Pgp-negative small-cell lung carcinoma cell line (GLC4) and its MDR1-gene-transfected Pgp subline (GLC4/Pgp) in opposite flanks. One hour after injection, the content of [ 11C]DNR in GLC4 tumors was 159\u000228% higher than that in GLC4/Pgp tumors. After modulation with cyclosporin A, the accu- mulation of [ 11C]DNR in GLC4/Pgp tumors increased to the levels observed in the GLC4 tumors due to blockade of Pgp efflux activity expressed in these tumors. Despite the promising results in identifying Pgp-expressing tumors, [ 11C]DNR has not been yet tested in clinical trials as a PET imaging tracer. The dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of DNR observed in humans [118] together with difficulties with the radiosynthesis of [ 11C]DNR, specially the low radiochemical yield, have limited further development of this tracer for human studies [119]. Another 11C-radiolabeled candidate for PET imaging of MDR was the calcium blocker channel antagonist verapamil. Besides its specific pharmaco- logical activity on calcium channels, verapamil is simultaneously a modulator and a substrate of Pgp, competing with cytostatic drugs for the drug efflux pump. [11C] verapamil was initially evaluated as a Pgp probe in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Initial studies showed a higher accumulation of [11C] verapamil (4–5 times) in sensitive cells when compared with Pgp-expressing cells suggesting that [11C] verapamil could be a potential PET imaging tracer of Pgp in tumors. Hendrikse et al. investigated the pharmacokinetics of [11C] verapamil with PET in solid tumors and in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [117,120]. For this study, a tumor-bearing rat model was developed. The animals were bilaterally inoculated with a Pgp-overexpressing human small-cell carcinoma (GLC4/Pgp) and its Pgp-negative counterpart (GLC4) to guaranteed equal sys- temic pharmacokinetics. The reversal effects of cyclosporin A on tumor pharma- cokinetics of [ 11C] verapamil were also evaluated. The maximum uptake of [ 11C] verapamil in both tumors was reached within 5 min following injection. The radiotracer uptake in GLC4/Pgp tumors, expressed as percentage of injected dose per milliliter of tumor, was 23% lower than in the wild-type tumors. When the animals were treated with 50 mg/kg cyclosporin A, the content of [ 11C]ver- apamil in GLC4/Pgp tumors increased to the levels achieved in the GLC4 tumors due to blockade of Pgp-mediated efflux. Figure 8 shows a representative PET Fig. 8 Representative images from a PET study with [11C]verapamil in a male rat bearing bilateral xenografts in the absence of modulator (A) and after treatment with cyclosporin A (B) (reprinted by permission from the American Association for Cancer Research, Ref. [117] Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 627 study in a male rat bearing bilateral xenografts in the absence of modulator (A) and after treatment with cyclosporin A (B). [ 11C]verapamil is also useful to measure the functional activity of Pgp in the blood–brain barrier (BBB). In the rat brain, the levels of [ 11C]verapamil increased 350% after modulation with cyclosporine A, demonstrating the usefulness of [ 11C]verapamil for in vivo visualizing Pgp function and its reversal [117]. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 8. Pgp is abundantly expressed in the BBB to protect the brain against potentially toxic exogenous compounds [121]. This important role of Pgp in the BBB was observed earlier in mdr1a(-/-) Pgp-knockout mice [122,123]. Brain levels of verapamil, digoxin, and cyclosporin A were found to be increased in Pgp-knockout mice compared with mdr1a(+/+) wild-type mice. Furthermore, the brain levels of digoxin in wild-type mice increased after block- adeofPgp with PSC833. In this way,concentrations ofclinically relevantdrugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS) and in solid tumors could be visualized and quantified in vivo with a non-invasive imaging technique such as PET. A PET imaging study in healthy volunteers showed that Pgp activity in the human BBB could be measured with [ 11C]verapamil. The increase observed in 11C-radioactivity in the brain, after treatment with cyclosporin A, was consis- tent with the inhibition of Pgp in the human BBB (Fig. 9) [124]. This has implications in terms of potential drug–drug interactions at the BBB with drugs that can inhibit Pgp at therapeutic concentrations. Such applications Fig. 9 Positron emission tomography images of a normal human brain after 11C-verapamil administration in the absence or presence of cyclosporine (CsA) indicate increased regional uptake (green to red areas) of 11C-radioactivity in the brain in the presence of CsA. Images represent standardized uptake values (SUV) summed over a period of 5–25 min, which provide an index of regional radioactivity uptake normalized to the administered dose and weight of the subject.

Gomes could be useful to determine the role of Pgp polymorphisms in the CNS distribution of drugs that are Pgp substrates. The cytostatic agent colchicine, a naturally occurring alkaloid was labeled with 11C and evaluated as a potential agent for MDR imaging with PET. The feasibility of using colchicine as a probe for MDR came from whole-body quantitative autoradiography studies using colchicine labeled with 14C. The biodistribution studies in mice xenografted with Pgp-positive and Pgp-negative human neutoblastomas demonstrated a 2-fold higher accumulation of [ 14C]col- chicine in sensitive tumors when compared with resistant tumors [125]. In a subsequent study, the same group evaluated the ability of 11C-labeled colchicine as a PET imaging agent for MDR in nude rats xenografted with sensitive human neuroblastoma cell line BE (2)-C and associated resistant strains. One hour post-injection, PET scans showed a 2-fold difference in the accumulation of [11C]colchicine between sensitive and resistant tumors [126]. Colchicine is electroneutral, and contrary to [99mTc]MIBI and [ 99mTc]Tetrofosmin, its cellu- lar uptake is not affected by membrane potential variations. Therefore, [11C]colchicine could serve as a good predictor of resistance to electroneutral cytostatic agents such as paclitaxel and some steroid hormones. Nevertheless, the detoxification of colchicine via the bile, as demonstrated by the relatively high uptake in liver and intestine from biodistribution studies [127], makes the radiolabeled colchicine only useful in tumors away from the abdominal cavity. 3.2.2 18F-Labeled Compounds 18F-labeled drugs benefit from the longer half-life of the nuclide (110 min), thus allowing us to monitor the kinetics of the modulation process and also the dynamics of the tracer in the body for longer periods when compared with 11C-labeled compounds. Paclitaxel belongs to a class of anticancer drugs (taxanes) that inhibits cellular proliferation through the stabilization of tubulin and is widely used in the treatment of patients with solid tumors. The response to treatment and the severity of adverse drug reactions vary substantially between individuals, being the expression of Pgp and its genetic variants one of the most important factors responsible for these differences. To determine the taxane biodistribution non- invasively, a synthetic scheme to make [ 18F]fluoropaclitaxel ([18F]FPAC) was developed. Previous studies have shown that paclitaxel can be fluorinated without inducing substantial alterations of its pharmacological properties [128]. The biodistribution of [18F]FPAC was studied in mice with and without human breast cancer tumor xenografts in a small-animal-dedicated PET and closely followed that of the parental drug when compared with [1H]paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is a neutral compound and unlike [ 99mTc]Sestamibi and [ 99mTc]Te- trofosmin does not require any electric gradient for intracellular retention. In addition, paclitaxel is not a substrate for MRP1, which makes [18F]FPAC a specific probe for Pgp. Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 629 Hsueh et al. evaluated the potential of [18F]FPAC to predict chemother- apy response of tumors to paclitaxel in mice bearing human breast cancer xenografts using a small-animal-dedicated PET [129]. PET images were acquired 30 min after [18F]FPAC injection. Tumor uptake was expressed as standardized uptake value (mSUV) units. After imaging, the animals were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of paclitaxel. The rate of change in tumor volume after treatment was compared with the magnitude of [18F]FPAC uptake. In general, the animals with low [18F]FPAC uptake demonstrated tumor progression after treatment, whereas those with high [18F]FPAC uptake tended to regress. Considering any increase in tumor volume as an indicator of chemoresistance to paclitaxel, the image criterion, indexed by [18F]FPAC uptake, had an overall accuracy of 82%, a sensitivity of 100%, and a specificity of 73% to identify chemoresistant tumors. To verify if the chemoresistance was related with a limited availability of the drug due to hepatic modulation, they compared the tracer accumulation in the liver with tumor uptake as well as therapeutic response. No significant correlation between tumor uptake and liver uptake of [18F]FPAC or tumor response was observed, thus confirming that liver uptake cannot account for decreased tumor uptake and resistance to paclitaxel [129]. These results suggestthatlower levels of [18F]FPAC in tumors are related with Pgp activity and tend to be associated with higher risk of resistance to paclitaxel and tumor progression. Another group studied in vivo the biodistribution of [ 18F]FPAC in three non-human primates at baseline and after administration of a third-generation MDR modulator (XR9576) [130]. The potential of [18F]FPAC as a MDR probe was estimated from the changes observed in [ 18F]FPAC content in organs normally expressing Pgp following administration of XR9576. The baseline biodistribution showed high [18F]FPAC accumulation in the hepatobiliary system and bowel, which is explained by the normal excretion route of pacli- taxel. After modulation with XR9576, an increase was observed in the retention of [ 18F]FPAC in the liver and in the lungs and a small increase in the efflux rate of the tracer in the kidneys. The changes in [ 18F]FPAC uptake after modulation were considered related with alterations in the functional activity of Pgp since these tissues are rich in Pgp. These data provide strong evidence that biodis- tribution of [18F]FPAC is similar to that of paclitaxel, as both are substrates of Pgp [131]. In a recent publication, Kurdziel et al. reported the results from [18F]FPAC PET imaging studies in a mouse model, normal volunteers, and breast cancer patients [132]. The mouse model was established by the subcutaneous injection of human epithelial KB 3-1 (drug-sensitive) and KB 8-5 (drug-resistant) cell lines into the shoulders and hind legs. Due to the small size of the tumors and interference from background activity, the micro-PET images of [18F]FPAC were difficult to appreciate (Fig. 10). Nevertheless, a drug-sensitive-to-drug- resistant tumor ratio of 1.35 was measured. The micro-PET imaging of surgical leg excised tumors showed significant differences in [18F]FPAC uptake between 630 C.M.F. Gomes drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors with an uptake ratio of 3.2 (Fig. 10). These results are similar to the ones reported above by Hsueh et al. in the human breast cancer mouse xenograft model. The pilot study in normal volunteers and breast cancer patients with [ 18F]FPAC was approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University Institu- tional Review Board, who developed an automated method for 18F-fluorination of paclitaxel [133]. The biodistribution of [ 18F]FPAC in normal volunteers was similar to that observed in the previous study in primates with lower background activity in chest, breast, and brain. The extensive hepatic clearance and subse- quent excretion into the bowel can compromise the diagnostic value of [ 18F]FPAC imaging in abdominal tumors. The results from the pilot study with breast cancer patients were promising although the number of patients studied was limited. The [18F]FPAC uptake in primary lesions of patients who responded to chemotherapy were not too high (SUV approx. 0.85) but remained constant over time. On the other side, patients with no significant uptake of [18F]FPAC showed only a partial response to chemotherapy [132]. These findings provide evidence that [18F]FPAC uptake can predict response to paclitaxel in breast cancer patients and may be useful as a clinical tool to select patients who might benefit from the addition of a Pgp modulator. The prior identification of patients who will not respond to a specific treatment can avoid the cost and morbidity associated with an ineffective chemotherapy regimen. However, further studies are needed, with Fig. 10 Xenografts were established by subcutaneously injecting 5\u0003105 cells into the right (KB 3-1; drug sensitive) and left (KB 8-5; drug resistant) shoulders of adult female nude mice. Micro-PET (Concorde micro-PET R4) imaging was performed 7 days postinoculation. While the overall FPAC uptake is low, slightly more FPAC can be seen in the drug-sensitive tumor. The drug-sensitive-to-drug-resistant tumor ratio was 1.35. Micro-PET imaging of surgically excised tumors (90 min, i.v., post-FPAC injection) showed a sensitive-to-resistant uptake ratio of 3.2 (reprinted by permission from Elsevier, Ref. [132]) Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 631 a larger patient base to evaluate the reproducibility of [ 18F]FPAC PET imaging and its impact on the management of breast cancer patients. The synthetic pirimidine, 5-fluouracil (5-FU), is used in the treatment of a variety of epithelial tumors including, colorectal, breast cancer, ovarian, head, and neck cancers. 5-FU enters tumor cells by a facilitated nucleobase transpor- ter and is converted into active metabolites (5 0-fluoro-20-deoxyuridine) by a complex metabolic pathway that interferes with both DNA and RNA synth- eses. Of particular interest is the conversion of 5-FU to 50-fluoro-20-deoxyur- idine (5-FUdR) and subsequent phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to the active metabolite 50-fluoro-2 0-DUMP (5-FdUMP). Unfortunately, the response rate of patients receiving 5-FU-based chemotherapy is relatively poor, varying between 10 and 30%. To further evaluate, 5-FU labeled with 18F (5-18FU) has been used in PET studies to understand the factors behind this strong interindividual variability. As 5-18FU is biochemically identical to 5-FU, PET has been used for quantitative pharmacokinetic measurements of 5-18FU in human and animal models. Several groups tried to correlate the 5- 18FU uptake with the response to therapy in a variety of animal models. In a previous study, Shani and Wolf examined the 5- 18FU uptake in mice bearing 5-FU sensitive and resistant L-1210 lymphocytic leukemia tumors in opposite flanks [134]. Two hours after injection, the tumor-to- blood ratio of 5- 18FU was 1.9 in sensitive tumors and 0.96 in resistant tumors. This difference was even greater 12 h post-injection with values of 20.69 and 4.04 for sensitive and resistant tumors, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that tumor response is associated with high 5- 18FU uptake in a delayed phase. Wolf et al. demonstrated that early uptake values (20 min) of 5-FU reflect the influx of the drug, whereas the uptake at delayed times (120 min) represents the trapped non-metabolized 5-FU. This was confirmed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies in patients. Fluorine-19 MRS allows differentiation between 5-FU and its inactive metabolites, such as a-fluoro-b-alanine without significant antitumor activity. The double examinations performed with PET and 19F-labeled magnetic MRS indicated that 5- 18FU accumulation in metastases reflects the non-metabolized trapped 5- 18FU [135]. The first studies in cancer patients with 5-18FU were carried out in Heidel- berg. Moehler et al. investigated the predictive value of 5-18FU PET for clinical response and survival of treated patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases [136]. The standard chemotherapeutic agent of metastatic colorectal carcinoma is 5-FU, as a single agent or in combination with others. The patients were submitted to a 5-18FU PET study prior to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. A semiquantitative approach of 5- 18FU based on the calculation of the standar- dized uptake value (SUV) normalized to the injected dose and body weight was performed. CT studies preceded the first chemotherapeutic cycle and were repeated within every 3–4 months after treatment. Tumor response was eval- uated based on the volumetric data of metastases according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Metastases were identified in cross-sections of 5-18FU PET scans. Visual inspection of images showed low trapping of 632 C.M.F. Gomes 5-18FU in tumor regions compared with the surrounding liver tissue and a large divergence within 5- 18FU distribution pattern for different metastases. The mean SUV in the liver metastases 120 min post-injection was approximately one-third of the mean SUV in the normal liver parenchyma and varied from 0.9 to 4.3. The patients with 5-18FU SUVs exceeding 2.8 had a stable disease for longer than 12 months and survival of longer than 21 months, whereas patients with 5- 18FU SUVs lower than 1.2 showed evidences of progressive disease and had a worst survival of less than 12 months [136]. These results were in accor- dance with those obtained by Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss et al. [137] in a parallel study of 12 colorectal carcinoma patients. They also observed a highly variable trapping of 5- 18FU even for multiple metastases in the same patients, and only metastases with 5- 18FU uptake exceeding 3.0 SUV responded to chemotherapy. A significant correlation of 0.86 (p<0.001) was found between 5- 18FU uptake before chemotherapy and the growth rate of the lesions after treatment as determined by CT. These preliminary results highlight the potential of PET for identifying patients who are most likely to respond to 5-FU therapy. Several mechanisms are thought to be responsible for resistance to 5-FU. Recently, members of the subfamily ABCC of the ATP-binding cassette super- family, including the MRP5 and MRP8, were shown to confer drug resistance to 5-FU and certain fluoropyrimidines [23,25,138]. These transporters mediated the ATP-dependent transport of 5-FU and the monophosphorylated metabolites 5-FdUMP and 5-FUMP. The accumulation of [ 3H]5-FU was sig- nificantly reduced by 2-fold in both stably and transient MRP5-transfected HEK cells when compared with their respective HEK-vector cells, suggesting an active role of MRP5 in the resistance to 5-FU. Furthermore, a potent transport inhibitor of MRP5 (NPPB) was shown to sensitize MRP5-transfected cells to 5-FU cytotoxicity [25]. These studies suggest that potent MDR inhibi- tors may be useful in reversing drug resistance to 5-FU. However, further studies are needed to explore whether MRP/ABCC transporters confer resis- tance to 5-FU in clinical samples. PET imaging using 5-18FU is a valuable tool that can be employed to clarify this point. 3.2.3 67Ga/68Ga-Radiopharmaceuticals A novel gallium(III) complex of the selected Schiff-base ligand (Ga-[3-ethoxy- ENBDMPI])+ was synthesized and evaluated as a potential probe to assess Pgp activity. This compound is a non-metabolized cationic hydrophobic complex that can be labeled either with the single-photon emitter 67Ga (t1/2 =78h)or with the positron emitter 68Ga (t1/2 = 68 min) thus having potential applica- tions in both SPECT and PET for the functional imaging of Pgp. Cell tracer transport experiments performed in drug-sensitive KB3-1 cells and KB8-5 cells expressing modest levels of Pgp demonstrated the high sensi- tivity of the 67Ga-complex in detecting the outward transport activity of Pgp [139]. The KB3-1-to-KB8-5 uptake ratio was 104 and the washout rate of 67Ga- complex in KB8-5 cells (k=0.20 min-1) was 10-fold faster when compared with Functional Imaging of Multidrug Resistance and Its Applications 633 that of KB3-1 cells (k=0.02 min-1). The residual uptake in control KB-3-1 cells after membrane depolarization with high concentrations of K+/valinomicin demonstrated the membrane potential dependence of the 67Ga-complex uptake and is indicative of the low non-specific membrane absorption. Further valida- tion of 67Ga-complex as a substrate of Pgp was provided by monitoring tracer accumulation in the presence of known Pgp inhibitors (LY335979, PSC833, and cyclosporin A). In KB8-5 cells a reversible effect proportional to the rank order potency of the tested inhibitors was observed. To further evaluate the potential utility of the 67/68Ga-complex as an in vivo marker of Pgp-mediated transport activity, the complexes were injected in wild- type and mdr1a/1b (-/-) knockout mice to study the drug transport across the BBB. As previously mentioned, Pgp is expressed in the luminal surfaces of brain endothelial cells preventing the entry of amphipathic compounds into the central nervous system. Therefore, the mdr1a/1b (-/-) knockout mice offer an interesting model to evaluate the applicability of radiotracers for in vivo trans- port activity of Pgp. At 5 min after injection, the brain uptake of 67Ga-complex in Pgp-knockout mice was 10-fold higher compared with that in the wild-type mice. As the cerebral blood flow did not differ significantly between the wild- type and the knockout mice, differences on initial brain uptake and retention of 67Ga-complex were not attributed to changes in cerebral perfusion. The potential utility of 68Ga-complex as a PET radiotracer was evaluated in mice with micro-PET [139]. Five minutes after tail vein injection of the 68Ga-complex, a greater net uptake in the brain of knockout mice was detected when compared with that of the wild-type mice, what is consistent with the biodistribution data obtained with the 67Ga-complex. Although the 67/68Ga- complex has been recognized as a transport substrate of Pgp, the authors are cautiously optimistic regarding its applicability in SPECT and PET imaging for in vivo assessment of Pgp activity. Issues related with radiation dosimetry and radiolabeling require additional experimentation. 4 Conclusions In this chapter, we have reviewed the potential of SPECT and PET imaging modalities for studying in vivo and non-invasively the classical mechanism of MDR in cancer. The feasibility of the clinically approved 99mTc-complexes, especially [99mTc]MIBI, for identifying drug-resistant tumors was demon- strated in numerous clinical studies in several different malignancies. A number of significant correlations were found between radiotracer kinetic parameters and Pgp and/or MRP1 expression in many cancers. Some reports also demon- strated the potential of functional imaging to predict tumor response to a particular chemotherapeutic regimen. Despite the evidences that the MDR phenotype can be assessed through a molecular imaging technique, this approach is not yet to be integrated into the clinical practice. The primary reason for this is the lack of general consensus concerning the relative 634 C.M.F. Gomes prognostic value of Pgp expression as uncertain and sometimes contradictory results have been reported. Nevertheless, the majority of these studies was single institution and enrolled a limited number of patients making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the predictive value of Pgp or MRP1 expression. Multi-institutional studies involving a reasonable numbers of patients and meta-analysis are required to reach more reliable conclusions on the role of functional imaging in predicting chemotherapy response. An important step toward the clinical application of functional imaging of MDR is the standardization and optimization of the image acquisition protocols. The appropriate time after radiotracer injection for planar or tomographic image acquisition as well as the post-processing of the images is crucial to identify a reliable index predictive of Pgp and/or MRP1 functional activity. Presently there is no consensus regarding the imaging biomarker that better predicts the functional activity of MDR-related transporters and the overall predictive value of these studies has not been validated to warrant changes in treatment protocols. In addition to its potential for recognizing non-invasively the MDR pheno- type in cancer patients, molecular imaging techniques can also be a powerful tool in evaluating the efficacy of MDR modulators. Examples of both in vitro and in vivo assays, using cellular and animal models, respectively, illustrated the potential utility of molecular imaging probes to assess the effects of different reversing agents on the inhibition of MDR transporters. Although no com- pound is currently in clinical use, several agents are in the process of clinical trials and a new generation of modulators is currently being developed. The application of imaging-based biomarkers of MDR transporters, in pre-clinical models, even in early development stages of promising modulators is of parti- cular interest in translational research, since it provides valuable data that can be used to accelerate clinical studies. For approved agents, such as verapamil and cyclosporin A, imaging probes could be applied in the clinical setting as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of modulators in the activity of MDR transporters in tumors. This information is extremely relevant for identifying those patients that would benefit from pre- or co-administration of modulators in their therapeutic protocols. The clinical application of PET-based imaging probes for assessing MDR is gaining increasing attention. Several chemotherapeutic agents labeled with 11Cor 18F were characterized as MDR substrates. Although showing promising results, some of these agents suffer from complex in vivo pharmacokinetics, mediated in part by the rapid metabolism of the radiolabeled compound, and others from modest radiochemical yields, which have limited their usefulness in clinical studies. In the near future, we expect to have new PET imaging-based biomarkers mole- cularly targeted for MDR-related transporters with potentially clinical utility. This will be a step toward the quantitative measurement of functional activity of MDR- related transporters, in vivo and non-invasively as a valuable tool to circumvent multidrug resistance in the clinical management of cancer patients.

This technology has been widely used in cancer research to better characterize cancer behaviors at mRNA level and to obtain new insights into various stages of carcinogenesis. A microarray-based experiment generally involves three major components: microarray manufacturing, sample processing, and data analysis, with the goals of identifying differential genes, expression signatures, modules, or networks associated with given pathological changes (Fig. 1). In this chapter, we will introduce the outline of DNA microarray technology and some basic issues related to gene expression microarray-based experiments. The state of the art of cancer gene expression studies regarding tumor development, molecular classi- fication, outcome, and therapeutic response prediction will be addressed. We will also consider the current challenges in data analysis and interpretation of genomics studies. Moreover, we will discuss the emerging concept of cancer systems biology and novel signature-based drug discovery strategies, which are very important for the development of individualized cancer medicine. 2 A DNA Microarray Technology Overview Since its introduction in 1995 [1, 2], microarray technology has greatly trans- formed molecular biology for more than a decade. The key difference between the microarray technology and traditional approaches to measuring gene expression, such as northern blot [3] and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the tremendous number of genes that can be monitored on a single array, allowing generally the simultaneous profiling of W.

This approach has deeply modified our way of performing biomedical research by switching from a gene-by-gene approach to global or genome-wide systemic studies. From its initial success as a tool for transcript-level analyses, microarray technology has spread into many areas, such as genotyping, methylation profiling, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and chromatin immunoprecipitation [4]. To many, the term microarray is equivalent to transcriptional profiling, which is our focus in this chapter. 2.1 Oligonucleotide Array Dominant Technology Platforms By definition, a DNA microarray is a piece of glass, plastic, or silicon chip on which single-stranded pieces of DNA spots, called probes, are affixed in a microscopic array. These probes are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA sample, called target, under high-stringency conditions. Although all DNA microarrays have similar basic principles, the available technical options differ widely between platforms [5]. Two of the most important differences are the length of the probes and the number of dyes used for labeling. They can be divided into two categories: (1) cDNA arrays, usually using probes constructed with PCR products of up to a few thousand base pairs and (2) oligonucleotide arrays, using either short (25–30 mer) or long oligonucleotide (50–80 mer) probes. The probes can be either contact spotted, ink-jet deposited, or directly synthesized on the substrate. Each of these approaches has its own require- ments in terms of experimental design, the amount of RNA needed, and data acquisition.

A DNA microarray-based experiment consists of three major components, including microarray manufacturing, sample processing, and data analysis. Technically, various types of microarray platforms can be divided into two categories, oligonucleotide arrays and cDNA arrays. To compare global difference in gene expression between two samples, total RNAs or mRNAs are extracted, which are subject to cDNA or cRNA synthesis and labeling. The labeled samples are then hybridized to DNA microarrays to generate raw expression profiling data. Upon data mining, differential genes, expression signatures, changed modules, and networks are identified 646 J. Yan and W. Gu 2.1.1 cDNA Arrays In cDNA microarrays, both the probes and the targets are cDNAs. Fluorescent dyes commonly used for target cDNA labeling include green (Cy3) dye, which has a fluorescence emission wavelength of 570 nm, and red (Cy5) dye, which has a fluorescence emission wavelength of 670 nm. The two Cy-labeled cDNA samples are mixed in equal proportions and hybridized to a single microarray that is then imaged in a microarray scanner to measure fluorescence of the two fluorophores after excitation with a laser beam of a defined wavelength. The ratio of the red and green fluorescence intensities for each spot is indicative of the relative abundance of the corresponding DNA probe in the two nucleic acid target samples. The cDNA arrays are an open-system approach, in which no sequence information is necessary before fabricating the arrays. The PCR products from cDNA banks can be synthesized using universal primers. The large size of the PCR product is also helpful in enabling stringent hybridization condi- tions and lowering cross-hybridization of unrelated genes, although closely related gene families will still be able to anneal to some extent. However, the preparation and the analysis of a large number of probe cDNAs are laborious and time consuming [6]. 2.1.2 Oligonucleotide Arrays In oligonucleotide microarrays, the probes are shorter sequences designed to match parts of the sequence of known or predicted open reading frames. The size of oligonucleotides used for making arrays can be short (such as 25-mer probes produced by Affymetrix) or long (such as 50-mer probes produced by Illumina). The dyes used for target labeling may be streptavidin–Alexa Fluor1647, streptavidin–phycoerythrin, Cy3 and Cy5, streptavidin–Cy3, or digoxygenin. Most of oligonucleotide arrays are detected using only one dye, called one-color or one-channel assays. Short oligonucleotide arrays were developed by Affymetrix using photolithographic methods [1]. They have been commercially available for more than 10 years and obtained wide acceptance in academic community. Up to now, they are the most commonly used oligonucleotide microarrays. Although this method is very efficient at producing thousands or millions of identical arrays, it is somewhat incon- venient and expensive for the fabrication of new arrays with added or different gene content. To address this issue and improve work efficiency, many methods of making long oligonucleotide arrays have been developed with robotic printing or in situ synthesis. The completion of numerous genomic sequences and increased effi- ciency of production have combined to make the use of long oligonucleotide arrays for gene expression studies a highly attractive alternative to short oligo- nucleotide or cDNA arrays. Their major advantages over the others include the following: (1) the longer length probes enable more specificity in hybridization than shorter length probe arrays; (2) compared with cDNA arrays, it is much Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 647 easier to deposit the same concentration of cDNA per spot with oligonucleo- tides, and no denaturation step is needed for hybridization; and (3) it is more flexible for adjusting array probe contents compared with photolithographic methods or cDNA arrays [6]. 2.2 Reliability and Reproducibility Issues in DNA Microarray Assays Systematically searching for determinants of a phenotype using gene expression profiling requires reasonable reproducibility, accuracy, and sensitivity in the technology employed. However, the publication of studies with dissimilar or totally contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples [7], has raised concerns about the reliability and consistency, and hence potential application of microarray technology in the clinical and regulatory settings. To address these concerns, the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated and led by FDA scientists involving 137 participants from 51 organizations. In this project, gene expres- sion levels were measured from two high-quality, distinct RNA samples in four titration pools on seven major microarray platforms, including Applied Biosystems, Affymetrix, Agilent Technologies, GE Healthcare, Illumina, Eppendorf, and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) system, in addition to three alternative expression methodologies. Each microarray platform was deployed at three independent test sites and five replicates were assayed at each site. The results indicate that microarray results were generally repeatable within a test site, reproducible between test sites and comparable across plat- forms, even though each microarray platform has made different trade-offs with respect to repeatability, sensitivity, specificity, and ratio compression. So the technical performance of microarrays as assessed in the MAQC project supports their continued use for gene expression profiling in basic and applied research and may lead to their use as a clinical diagnostic tool as well [8]. It is estimated that the detection limit of current microarray technology seems to be between 1 and 10 copies of mRNA per cell. However, to some extent, inaccurate and inconsistent microarray measurements are almost una- voidable due to several reasons: (1) the actual relationship between probe sequences, target concentration, and probe intensity is rather poorly under- stood; (2) the existence of ubiquitous splice variants for at least half of the human genes. Covering various types of alternatively spliced exons on short oligonucleotide-based arrays is necessary to dissect the splice variant-associated composite signals. cDNA microarrays usually have a unique long probe with which the abundance of several splice variants can be measured. This might explain some of the discrepancies often observed between cDNA and short oligonucleotide microarrays; and (3) target transcript folding and cross- hybridization can also contribute to the variation between different probes targeting the same region of a given transcript. It is also believed that accurate 648 J. Yan and W. Gu measurements of absolute expression levels and the reliable detection of low- abundance genes are currently beyond the reach of microarray technology [9]. 2.3 Experimental Design for Microarray Assays There are three primary objectives in microarray studies: class comparison, class discovery, and class prediction [10, 11]. Class comparison studies are to determine whether the expression profiles are different between the classes and, if so, to identify the differentially expressed genes. One example of a class comparison study is the comparison of gene expression profiles of grade 1 and grade 3 breast cancer patients. Class discovery studies are to identify new subtypes of a disease. Examples of class discovery are the work of Perou et al. [12], in which several molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been identified. Class prediction studies are similar to class comparison studies in that the classes are predefined. In class prediction studies, however, the emphasis is on developing valid molecular profiles with potential clinical applications, includ- ing risk assessment, diagnostic testing, prognostic stratification, and treatment selection. Many studies include both class comparison and class prediction objectives. Experimental design depends on the study objective, but there are a few general principles that apply to all experiments. Perhaps the major issues are making sure that there is sufficient replication and avoiding the influence of confounding factors. There are also some special considerations and issues related to the design of two-channel assays, which are described below. 2.3.1 Biological and Technical Replication In microarray studies, there are two types of replications: biological replication and technical replication. Biological replication involves hybridizations with mRNAs from different samples, whereas technical replication refers to multiple hybridiza- tions that involve mRNA from a single biological sample. Technical replicates mean to estimate the effects of measurement variability, which is generally much smaller than biological replicates. Moreover, most commercial microarray plat- forms have reached a degree of reproducibility that technical replicates are of very limited value now. So technical replicates are almost never required when the study objective is to make inferences about populations that are based on sample data. They are needed only for quality-control studies. Biological replicates enable researchers to control both measurement variability and biological differences between samples. They are required in almost all experiments involving class comparison through statistical inference [13]. A recommended minimum of biolo- gical replicates for class comparison studies is five per group. Determining sample size is one of major statistical challenges in microarray studies [14]. Several approaches have been described and tailored to specific study designs [15, 16]. Although there is no ‘‘best’’ methods identified, there is consensus Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 649 that power analyses should be done, that microarray-tailored newer methods should be used, and that more replicates generally provide greater statistical power [13]. 2.3.2 Sample Pooling In microarray experiments, pooling refers to the study design in which RNAs collected from several individuals are combined in a pooled sample before hybridization. Labeling and hybridization are then performed on the composite sample. Many researchers favor this pooling design for several reasons: (1) sample size can be increased without using more microarrays to enhance the statistical power [13]; (2) enough RNAs can be obtained through pooling, as an alternative to RNA amplification, for performing microarray analysis [17, 18]; (3) biological subject-to-subject variability can be reduced to increase the power of statistical tests [18]. For class comparison studies, pooling is arguably ben- eficial [13, 19]. But pooling is not recommended for classification studies since it will interfere with the ability to accurately assess interindividual variation and covariation. Of note, when using pooling, one has to avoid bad or unusual individual samples and cannot simply analyze one pool per group [13]. 2.3.3 Confounding Factors and Bias Confounding refers to a problem that distorts the true relationship between a real causal factor and a disease [20]. A confounder can affect the outcome of interest but is unequally distributed among the study groups. Common confounders in cancer study include age, gender, cancer stage, tumor histology, and treatment received. In cancer expression profiling analysis, a simple attribution of differences in expres- sion patterns between groups to the characteristics of disease state is inappropriate in the absence of data regarding these confounding factors. To minimize or ideally eliminate such factors, one needs to obtain comprehensive clinical/pathological annotation and stratify samples using known confounders [14]. Bias refers to an error of study design where study cases are handled differ- ently. Possible sources of bias in microarray studies include the batch of reagents used, array batch, array version, operator, processing date, system update, plat- form, and pooling of tissues from multiple tissue banks. To reduce systematic study bias, one needs to develop strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, avoid inappropriate pooling of samples, and randomize processing of samples [14]. Ideally, a prospective study design should be pursued because it is one of the best ways for controlling confounding and reducing biases. This approach has just started to be adopted in two trials of breast cancer [21, 22]. 2.3.4 Special Considerations with Two-Channel Microarrays Based on the number of dyes used for target labeling, microarrays can also be categorized into two-channel (two dyes are used, such as Agilent 60-mer arrays 650 J. Yan and W. Gu and all cDNA arrays) and one-channel arrays (one dye is used, like most of oligonucleotide arrays). The use of two-channel arrays faces greater challenges in experimental design. The first thing to always keep in mind is that the intensities coming from the two channels should not be used separately in analysis; instead one should work directly with their ratios. There are two common designs with two-channel arrays: direct comparison and reference design [23]. In direct comparison, two samples are labeled with red or green dye differently and hybridized on the same array. For the sake of normalization and use it as technical replication, one might hybridize each pair of samples twice, swapping the channels for half the assays (‘‘dye swaps’’). This design is sufficient for measuring differential gene expression between two conditions, but not for multiple condition comparison. In reference design, a reference sample is used for conducting all the direct comparisons. The reference sample can be either a universal reference (such as those sold by Stratagene) or a pooled reference from the samples that will be assayed in the experiment. A pooled reference may provide better performance in a class comparison analysis [23]. A variant of the reference design is the blocked reference design, in which independent references are matched (relative to some relevant factor) to the conditions that one wants to compare and are cohybridized to each respectively. This type of design can be useful in time series experiments and in drug experiments [16, 24]. 2.4 Data Analysis Microarray data analysis is a new area of data analysis with its own unique challenges [25]. Based on the study purposes, this process can be subdivided into two components: primary analysis and integrated analysis. Primary analysis involves differential expression identification and classification for the three primary study objectives (i.e., class comparison, class discovery, and class prediction). Integrated analysis means to identify metasignatures, pathways and networks by integrating various sources of data. 2.4.1 Primary Data Analysis Data Preprocessing Primary data analysis starts with data preprocessing to control the effects of systematic error while retaining full biological variation. This process consists of image analysis, filtering, normalization and transformation. As for image analysis, a variety of freeware and commercial software packages have been developed and this remains an active area of research. For Affymetrix arrays, different algorithms have been proposed, and RMA (Robust Multichip Ana- lysis) and its variant gcRMA are often favored by many investigators [13]. For Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 651 non-Affymetrix platforms, image-processing algorithms abound and vary sub- stantially with no clear ‘‘winner’’ emerging. Filtering refers to exclusion of bad probes on the array or the whole array. Visual inspection of array images and color-coded plot images are the first tools that should be used to detect outlier probes or arrays [23]. Clustering (described below) is another common way to identify outlier array among the whole set of arrays in a study. In terms of normalization, there are many options for investigators. For Affymetrix arrays, the quantile normalization method is believed to work better on Affymetrix data at the probe cell level [23]. This method makes the assump- tion that the samples hybridized to the different assays have roughly the same distribution of RNA abundance over the transcripts represented on the array. This algorithm transforms the intensities so that the bulk of the intensity distribution is the same for all assays in an experiment, typically with some differences in the distribution tails (which might reflect actual biological differ- ences). But for non-Affymetrix arrays, it is unclear which normalization method produce better results [13]. Differentially Expressed Gene Identification Differential expression analysis refers to finding genes that are expressed at different levels between two experimental conditions. Numerous methods have been applied to the identification of differentially expressed genes in microarray studies. The simplest, nonstatistical test method often used is the fold change method. In this method, the ratios between expression levels in two conditions are evaluated. Genes with a ratio higher than an arbitrary cutoff value are considered to be differentially expressed [26]. However, as a nonstatistical test, this approach offers no associated level of ‘‘confidence.’’ It also does not provide any control on the number of false-positive findings. The emerging standard approach is based on statistical significance and multiple hypothesis testing. The classical t test and other traditional test statis- tics perform well in the presence of a large number of replicates per condition. But microarray studies generally do not meet this requirement. Modified meth- ods based on t or F statistics, which borrow variance information among genes, called regularized t-tests, are recommended if there are less than 10 samples per condition [27, 28]. More sophisticated multivariate testing methods, such as the widely used SAM [29], can provide greater power than the regularized t-tests while controlling false discovery rate (FDR) [30]. It should be noted that different methods produce gene lists that are strikingly different. For example, in a comparison of 10 common methods of differential expression identification, Jeffery et al. found that only 8–21% of genes were in common across all 10 selection methods [31]. They also made recommendations for choice of selection methods in different settings such as area under an ROC curve with datasets that have low levels of noise and large sample size, rank products with datasets that have low numbers of samples or high levels of noise, and empirical Bayes t-statistic with a wide range of sample sizes. 652 J. Yan and W. Gu Classification Classification refers to either identifying new classes within a dataset (class discovery) or assigning cases to a given class (class prediction) [13]. It is a very popular use of microarray experiments. In class discovery, unsupervised clus- tering approaches are utilized to classify the profiles into groups based on their similarity. A most commonly used unsupervised method in microarray studies is two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis, which graphically presents results in a tree diagram (dendrogram). Many questions regarding molecular classification of a disease, gene coexpression, data reduction, and data quality control could be addressed using unsupervised classification. Common non- hierarchical clustering methods include k-means method and self-organizing map [32]. However, most clusterings in microarray datasets are found not to be reproducible and resampling techniques are recommended to assess the repro- ducibility of clustering findings [13]. In class prediction, supervised approaches have been used to develop algo- rithms to assign objects to known categories. The goal may be diagnostic, offering a new way to distinguish similar-looking diseases, or it may be a true effort to predict clinical outcome. Most such methods include a training phase run on samples whose classes are already known, and a testing phase, in which the algorithm generalizes from the training data to predict classifications of previously unseen samples. Many supervised classification algorithms are avail- able, such as k-nearest neighbors, nearest centroid, support vector machine (SVM), and classification trees [23]. But all are susceptible to overfitting to some degree, which refers to the case where an algorithm models the training samples too exactly, without sufficient generalization [13]. To address this problem, one must cross-validate it on testing data that are completely independent of the training data. 2.4.2 Integrated Data Analysis Although primary analyses are useful for deciphering the complex molecular heterogeneity of biological phenomena, integrative bioinformatics approaches that leverage numerous other data sources have begun to show promise in uncovering important biology not apparent from these primary analysis meth- ods [33]. This transition is accelerated with community efforts to standardize data and knowledge storage formats and access protocols and efforts to make the corresponding bases publicly available, most often through web-based access. Meta-Analysis With large public resources of microarray easily available, primarily ArrayEx- press and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a new era is dawning on microarray analysis. One of the approaches concerns combining information Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 653 from multiple independent but related existing microarray studies to increase the reliability and generalizability of results through meta-analysis. Meta- analysis has been widely used in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Its applicability to microarray data was demonstrated for the first time in a prostate cancer study [34], where a summary of statistic-based method coupled with false discovery rate analysis was applied on four prostate cancer gene expression studies. A robust signature of overactive polyamine biosynthesis pathway was identified, which is consistent with the known elevation of poly- amines in prostate cancer. Since then, microarray meta-analysis has been used to identify robust expression signatures, coexpressed genes, or gene networks [35]. Meta-analysis of microarray datasets shares many features with meta-ana- lysis in other areas of health-care research. The main differences lie in the large numbers of variables involved and technical diversity of multiple platforms. Furthermore, most microarray studies are retrospective and many confounding factors may interfere with the interpretation of results. To help perform valid microarray meta-analysis, Ramasamy et al. [35] recently identified seven key issues and suggested a 30-step approach, consisting of (1) Identify suitable microarray studies; (2) Extract the data from studies; (3) Prepare the individual datasets; (4) Annotate the individual datasets; (5) Resolve the many-to-many relationship between probes and genes; (6) Combine the study-specific esti- mates; (7) Analyze, present, and interpret results. Modular/Pathway Analysis The complex functions of a living cell can be better understood in the framework of pathways and networks [36]. In microarray studies, a pathway often refers to a gene set with a given biological theme, also called ‘‘module’’ [37]. The hypothesis that genes in the same module are more likely to be coordinately regulated than a randomly selected gene set has been recently demonstrated using coherence indicators estimated in 96 pathways in tumor and normal samples [38]. Modular analysis integrates the primary microarray analysis results and their functional annotations based on precompiled databases of pathways derived from large-scale literature analysis or computer-assisted annotation, such as Gene Ontol- ogy [39], KEGG [40], Biocarta (http://www.biocarta.com/), and GenMAPP [41]. The power of pathway analysis was demonstrated by Mootha et al. [42]. By applying a method called gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), they found that genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in diabetic muscle. This result was unexpected because in the original analysis, no individual genes showed significant deregulation in diabetic muscle. Only when examining functionally related gene sets were they able to identify the change. In another study, Yu et al. [43] identified a novel, robust, and biologically relevant, low-grade expression signature using the signature analysis (SA) algorithm [44]. This signature, TuM1, was not readily discernible by conven- tional clustering techniques. It is expressed in a subset of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors and is significantly enriched with genes involved in 654 J. Yan and W. Gu apoptosis. This finding was validated in multiple independent breast cancer datasets generated using different array technologies. Each type of modular analysis needs its own method of interpretation to maximize the information that is available. Interpretation of the results of modular analysis might be complicated by the variable quality of the functional descriptions. A major drawback of modular analysis is the large number of genes for which no biological classification exists; this might be the case for more than half of the genes represented on a microarray. Gene Network Analysis Although modular analysis is helpful for better interpretation of microarray data, individual modules are not enough to explain the complex functions of a living cell since biological processes usually involve interactions of more than one modules in the form of network. So it is very important to perform network analysis to make full use of various sources of data. There are two main types of networks being pursued by microarray research- ers: protein interactome network and transcriptional regulatory network. The study of interactome network requires detailed protein–protein interaction (‘‘interactome’’) databases. Such repositories can be broadly classified into two types based on the ways they are created: (1) Those containing interactions supported by experimental evidence or (2) Those containing interactions derived from in silico predictions alone or mixed together with experimentally derived evidence. Many primary databases that contain literature-curated interactome information are publicly available, such as human protein refer- ence database (HPRD), InAct, molecular interaction database (MINT), data- base of interacting protein (DIP), MIPS database, Alliance for cellular signal- ing (AfCS), biomolecular interaction network database (BIND), Reactome, and PDZBase. Several large transcription regulatory interaction databases are now also available to the public, such as TRANSFAC, TRED, VISTA Enhancer, and PreMod. It is good for modern biologists to know that many network-based analysis approaches have been implemented in ready-to-use and freely accessible databases and softwares [36]. When considering the current state of human molecular interaction maps and databases, it is important to note the limitations and pitfalls. First, because these information are largely incomplete and probably contain several errors, impor- tant modules and subnetworks may be missed by such analysis. For example, when considering networks generated from the literature, only well-studied proteins and interactions will be represented, and when considering networks generated from high-throughput yeast two-hybrid experiments, only nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins will be represented. Furthermore, protein–protein interac- tions are probably often context dependent (i.e., an interaction that occurs in a specific cell line or artificial system may not occur in vivo). Therefore, until these networks have matured, insights gained from their analysis must be treated as hypotheses requiring careful experimental validation. Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 655 2.5 Data Validation There are two categories of approaches to independent confirmation of differ- ential expression data: in silico analysis and laboratory-based analysis [45]. The in silico method compares array results in the literature and in public or private biological databases. Laboratory-based validation provides biomedical verifi- cation of microarray findings using semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, northern blot, or in situ hybridization. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) are an excellent approach for the validation of array data [45]. A TMA is a slide containing dozens to hundreds of predefined microscopic sections of tissue, enabling an investigator to measure DNA, mRNA, or protein expression using immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization simultaneously in a large number of samples. A particular advantage of the method is to provide in situ information about gene and its expression. But the most sig- nificant drawbacks of this method are low sensitivity, poor quantitation, and sample selection bias. To estimate the accuracy of a classification method, the standard strategy is via a training validation approach, in which a training set is used to identify the signature and a validation set is used to estimate the proportion of misclassifi- cations [46]. However, there are many questions unresolved as to when and how valida- tion should be performed as well as what the criteria under which a finding can be claimed to be validated are [13]. 3 Characterization of Cancer Using Expression Signatures Traditionally, cancer is characterized by gross visual information (size of the tumor, degree of spread, histological characteristics of the tumor) along with a limited number of biochemical assays. Although these methods do provide a way to classify tumor subgroups with distinct biology, it is obvious that these classifications are imprecise, offering little information on precise underlying molecular changes required for proper management. The feasibility of expres- sion signatures in the characterization of cancer was first demonstrated in a landmark study on leukemia where expression signature was used to distinguish acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemias without previous knowledge of these classes [10]. So far, gene expression profiling of cancers represents the largest category of research using microarray technology and appears to be the most comprehensive approach to characterize cancer molecularly [47]. Among the cancers studied with microarrays, breast cancer is the most heavily explored, thus resulting in a great deal of functional information about it (Fig. 2). Breast cancer also represents a window that displays the contents and status of gene expression profiling studies of cancer [48]. 656 J. Yan and W. Gu 3.1 Tumor Individuality The complexity of oncogenic process, involving somatic multiple mutations coupled with variability in the host’s genetic constitution, produces a disease of enormous complexity. That is why Nevins et al. believe that 100 breast cancer patients may represent 100 distinct diseases [47]. The concept of each tumor as an individual was documented during the classification of breast carcinomas, because repeated samplings of the same tumor, either before and after che- motherapy or as a tumor–metastasis pair, were found to have much more similarity to each other than to any other tumor studied [49]. Furthermore, different foci in an individual may have distinct profiles and clonally related tumors in the same individual can show different expression patterns owing to divergent histories [50]. 3.2 Molecular Classification of Cancer In most human malignancies, clinical classifications are essential for prognosis assessment and cancer management. Also, they provide baseline information for unbiased comparisons in clinical research. In the last decade, traditional method-generated molecular parameters have been pursued and incorporated in cancer classifications. Molecular data may either define tumor clinical aggressiveness or represent new targets for drug development. For example, human epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB2/HER-2) amplifications in breast cancer and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression/ mutations in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) identify a subgroup of patients with better response to trastuzumab and in some instances erlotinib, respectively [51, 52]. As a result, molecular cancer classification is critical for proper handling of cancer patients in clinical settings. 11 11 12 14 16 16 20 23 33 44 0 10 20 30 40 50 Sarcoma Renal Colon Ovarian Lung Lymphoma Prostate Brain Leukemia Breast Cancer TypeDataset Number Fig. 2 Top 10 cancers studied using gene expression microarrays. Data resource: Oncomine (as of September 27, 2008) (www.oncomine.org), a large compendium of published cancer microarray data with a suite of advanced analytic tools Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 657 The classification of human tumors using DNA microarray technology has been an area of intense research in the last decade. For example, many studies have consistently shown that breast cancer can be molecularly classified into at least four subtypes: the basal-like subtype, the ERBB2-like subtype, and lumi- nal-like subtypes A and B. Importantly, the newly defined molecular subgroups have distinct clinical outcomes and responses to therapy [48]. Four main histological subtypes of lung cancer are regularly distinguished by tumor morphology under the light microscope: squamous, large cell, small cell, and adenocarcinoma. In the microarray studies of lung cancer, two separate groups using different microarray platforms (Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays and cDNA arrays) have identified similar expression signatures that accurately recapitulated these four histological subtypes [53]. Moreover, in an integrative study, Hayes et al. identified three reproducible tumor subtypes within the category of adenocarcinoma of the lung [54]. They were named bronchioid, squamoid, and magnoid to reflect their respective correlations with gene expres- sion patterns of histologically defined bronchioalveolar carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma. Remarkably, bronchioid tumors were correlated with improved survival in early stage disease, whereas squamoid tumors were associated with better survival in advanced disease. Identification of the primary anatomical site of tumor origin is very impor- tant for proper treatment of cancer of unknown origin. It is estimated that 4% of cancer patients present with metastatic tumors for which the origin of the primary tumor has not been determined [55]. To address this issue, Su et al. developed a multiclass molecular classification scheme based on genes whose expression was specific to tumor tissues of each anatomical site. The classifier showed 85% accuracy on test set predictions and 75% accuracy on metastasis sample predictions. Of note, an 11-gene classifier could predict the anatomical origin of up to 91% and 83% of the training and blinded tumor samples, respectively [56]. 3.3 Common Transcriptional Programs for Tumor Development A basic assumption in cancer research is that some common transcriptional programs may be shared across different types of tumors during the course of carcinogenesis, consisting of initiation, progression, and metastasis. This assumption proves to be valid by some microarray studies. For example, in a recent meta-analysis of 40 published cancer microarray datasets that represent approximately 3,700 cancer samples, Rhodes et al. meta-analyzed 36 neoplastic transformation signatures from 21 datasets (overexpressed in cancer relative to respective normal tissue), which span 12 tissue types including breast, prostate, colon, lung, liver, brain, ovary, pancreas, uterus, salivary gland, bladder, and B lymphocytes. Eventually, 183 genes were identified to be present in at least 10 of 36 signatures, 67 genes in at least 12 signatures, and 1 gene in 18 signatures. To 658 J. Yan and W. Gu assess the universality of the meta-signature, the top 67 genes were used to predict cancer vs. normal status in 39 analyses using a leave-one-out voting classifier. The signature was validated as a significant predictor (P < 0.05) in 29 of 39 analyses (from 19 of 21 datasets) [57]. In terms of cancer progression, this study meta-profiled seven ‘‘undifferen- tiated vs. well-differentiated’’ signatures spanning six cancer types. Sixty-nine genes were present in at least four of seven signatures, twenty-four genes were present in five signatures, and six genes were present in six of seven signatures, whereas zero genes were significant in five or more by chance, thus defining an undifferentiated meta-signature common to multiple types of cancer. Interest- ingly, a fraction of genes predominantly associated with proliferation (such as TOP2A, MCM3, CDC2, RFC4) in this meta-signature overlap with the meta- signature of neoplastic transformation, suggesting the commonality in increased proliferation in both cancer initiation and progression. Metastasis is a fatal event that is generally regarded as a result of accumulat- ing somatic mutation in the late phase of carcinogenesis. To elucidate the molecular nature of metastasis, Ramaswamy et al. [58] analyzed the gene expression profiles of 12 metastatic adenocarcinoma nodules of diverse origin (lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, uterus, and ovary) and compared them with the expression profiles of 64 unmatched primary adenocarcinomas representing the same spectrum of tumor types obtained from different individuals. This study identified a refined 17-gene expression signature that can distinguish primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas (Fig. 3). The enriched functional changes include overactivities of structural protein, chromosomal rearrange- ment, and cell communication as well as decreased activities of calmodulin binding and methylation. The generality of the expression signature was further confirmed in 279 primary solid tumors of diverse type, but not in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, consistent with the idea that hematopoietic tumors have Universal cancer signature of metastases Enrichments of functional changes of cancer metastasis Up COL1A1,COL1A2,DHPS, EIF4EL3,HNRPAB,LMNB1, PTTG1,SNRPF Down ACTG2,CNN1,HLA -DPB1, MT3,MYH11,MYLK,NR4A1, RBM5,RUNX1 Overactivities of structural protein/chromosomal rearrangement/ cell Communication (LMNB1, COL1A2, COL1A1) Decreased activities of calmodulin-binding (MYH11, CNN1, MYLK) and methylation (ACTG2, MYH11, RUNX1) Fig. 3 A universal cancer signature of metastases. Identified by Ramaswamy et al. [58] through a microarray assay of 12 metastatic adenocarcinoma nodules of diverse origin (lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, uterus, and ovary), this 17-gene metastatic signature suggests involvement of altered functional changes of structural proteins, calmodulin binding, and methylation in cancer metastasis. The functional annotation of gene expression changes was performed using DAVID bioinformatics tools (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 659 distinct mechanisms for navigating the hematologic and lymphoid compart- ments [58]. They found that solid tumors carrying the expression signature were most likely to be associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome (P < 0.03), suggesting the hypothesis that a gene expression program of metastasis may already be present in the early phase of disease at the time of diagnosis. 3.4 Cancer Prognostic Prediction In the last 5 years, gene expression profiling has been extensively used to predict outcome of many cancer patients. Breast cancer has been a hot topic in this field. Many disparate signatures with little overlap in their constituent genes have been identified and validated [48]. To further validate these findings and to find the reasons for this signature diversity, Wirapati et al. performed a largest meta-analysis of publicly available breast cancer gene expression and clinical data, which are composed of 2,833 breast tumors, together with a modular analysis [59]. The performance of nine published prognostic signatures, includ- ing ONC-16, NKI-70, EMC-76, NCH-70, CON-52, p53-32, VSR, GGI-128, and CCYC, was evaluated in this dataset collection. Using this approach, they confirmed the presence of four stable breast cancer molecular subtypes as originally reported by Perou and colleagues [49]. Furthermore, they validated the equivalence of all the investigated prognostic signatures. Finally, through modular analyses they noticed that these prognostic signatures function mostly by identifying tumors that have high expression of proliferation genes, regard- less of the subtyping based on estrogen receptor (ER) or ERBB2, suggesting that proliferation may be the common driving force of several prognostic signatures (Fig. 4). Importantly, this study provided a new methodological framework applicable to other cancers for identifying consistent biological themes behind various reported signatures. In the case of lung cancer study, many different prognostic signatures for survival in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have also been reported in the literature [60]. To further validate the performance of these signatures, Sun et al. conducted a large retrospective, multisite, blinded study using a total of 442 lung adenocarcinomas [60]. The results showed that several signatures examined could accurately predict the outcome of patients. Moreover, most signatures performed better with clinical covariates (stage, age, and sex), sup- porting the combined use of clinical and molecular information when building prognostic models for early stage lung cancer. 3.5 Cancer Therapeutic Response Prediction Our ability to treat patients based on their needs is definitely inadequate since we do not know which therapy will be the most effective for each individual patient. Indeed, predicting drug response is a great challenge in oncology, as commonly used therapeutic agents are ineffective in many patients, and side 660 J. Yan and W. Gu effects often develop. With the gene expression profiling assays, it is possible to discover correlations between a set of genes and the sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells to a given therapy toward a human cancer. Accurate prediction of patient response to drugs is a long-term goal of pharmacogenomics research as it would facilitate the individualization of patient treatment. In an effort to find a way to predict chemotherapy sensitivity, Staunton et al. [61] conducted microarray assays using 232 cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs in a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60). Expression profile-based classifiers of sensitivity or resistance to these compounds were generated and then evaluated on independent sets of data. About one-fourth of the classifiers performed accurately, suggesting that at least for a subset of compounds, genomic approaches to chemosensitivity prediction are feasible. These signa- tures have recently been further validated to be able to accurately predict clinical response in individuals treated with these drugs [62]. 4 Toward Systems Biology of Cancer Fueled mainly by the development of microarray technology, systematic study on cancer using systems biology approach has increased (Fig. 5).

Based on a recent meta-analysis of gene expression profiles in breast cancer [59], most of identified gene expression changes (A), prognostic signatures (B), and altered modules (C) in breast cancer are related to proliferation Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 661 components of a biological system, with the goal of understanding its emergent properties [63]. The key idea behind systems biology is that complex biological systems must be robust against environmental and genetic perturbations to be evolvable. So cancer is regarded as a highly robust disease in which the tumor eventually surpasses the host in growth [64]. To ensure the robustness of a system, four proposed mechanisms are involved: system control, fail-safe, modularity, and decoupling [64]. In the following sections, we introduce these four mechanisms using evidence obtained in cancer research, especially expres- sion profiling studies. 4.1 System Control System control refers to negative and positive feedbacks to attain a robust dynamic response from a regulatory network point of view. For example, the oncogene c-Myc is a key transcriptional regulator highly expressed in many cancer types. In the past decades, the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myc functions to effect tumorigenesis have been the subject of extensive research. However, the specific mechanisms by which tumorigenesis are achieved are not well understood in a perspective of traditional molecular biology. Recently, Reymann et al. [65] performed a genome-wide expression profiling analysis on lung adenocarcinomas of c-myc transgenic mice in order to elucidate the c-Myc transcriptional regulatory network. They first identified 469 upregulated genes and 8 downregulated genes in tumors. Then they analyzed the promoters of transcriptionally induced genes with respect to the binding sites of c-Myc and other transcription factors. The network analysis identified a transcriptional regulatory network, consisting of at least 17 nodes (transcription factors such as Ap2, Zf5, Zic3, and E2f) and positive and negative interactions in a hierarchical infrastructure. 0 100 200 300 400 500 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 YearPaper Number Fig. 5 Growth of research interest in cancer systems biology in the last decade. The literature search was performed using the database PubMed for the number of articles about cancer systems biology per year. Key word combination was ‘‘‘systems biology’’ AND cancer’ 662 J. Yan and W. Gu 4.2 Fail-Safe (Alternative) Fail-safe, also called ‘‘alternative,’’ is a mechanism by which a specific function is achieved through multiple means to prevent failure of robustness. It refers to having multiple heterogeneous components or modules with overlapping func- tions. In fact, that is all we have learnt and are puzzled in more than a decade of microarray studies: unstable gene lists with common biological themes [14]. For example, ‘‘proliferation signatures’’ have been observed consistently in almost all tumor microarray studies [66] and turn out to be the ‘‘core component’’ of various different prognostic signatures for breast cancer [59]. However, the exact gene identities that comprise these signatures often vary greatly [66]. These results suggest that the hypothesis of the existence of a universal mechan- ism for all individuals with a disease is not valid. Although several studies have revealed some consensus signatures as described above, these changes can explain only some basic features of tumor behavior, but not a wide variety of heterogeneity. So it is arguable that several thousands of samples are needed to make a true discovery in microarray study [67]. With this in mind, many microarray data will be easier to understand and be better interpreted. 4.3 Modularity Modularity is a basic characteristic of complex systems. A module in a network is a set of nodes that have strong interactions and a common function. Mod- ularity can contribute to both robustness of the whole system, by confining perturbations and damage locally to minimize the effects on, and evolution, by simply rewiring modules. In the last two decades, using traditional strategies, cancer researchers have collected an enormous amount of information about the differences between cancer cells and their healthy counterparts, with the ultimate goal of identifying drug targets. This has, for instance, led to the identification of about 300 genes that are causally implicated in human cancer and to the discovery of the mutations in those genes [68]. Most of these genes function in signal transduc- tion processes regulating cell growth and apoptosis [69]. It is clear that these genes work in a modular fashion. For example, compelling evidence indicate that cancer-related genes CDK4, CCND1, Rb, and P16 establish a cell cycle module involved in human cancers. Cancer involves disruptions of various cellular processes and functions due to aberrations in regulation of key proliferation and survival pathways. Some changes are common to all tumors, whereas others may be specific to certain tumors. Understanding the precise genome-wide changes in terms of modules for a given tumor has important therapeutic implications. To this end, Eran Segal et al. [37] performed an integrative analysis of 1,975 published micro- arrays spanning 22 tumor types. They identified 456 statistically significant Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 663 modules that span various processes and functions, including metabolism, transcription, translation, degradation, cellular and neural signaling, growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, extracellular matrix, and cytoskeleton components. Then, they characterized tumors in terms of a combination of activated and deacti- vated modules. Some changes of modules are specific to particular types of tumor; for example, a growth-inhibitory module is specifically downregulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and may underlie the deregulated prolifera- tion in these cancers. Other changes of modules are shared across a diverse set of tumors, suggestive of common tumor progression mechanisms. For example, the bone osteoblastic module was identified in a variety of tumor types. 4.4 Decoupling Decoupling represents a preventive mechanism against damaging high-level functionalities. For example, Hsp90 not only fixes proteins that are misfolded as a result of environmental stresses but also decouples genetic variations from the phenotype using the same mechanism, therefore providing a genetic buffer against mutations. Interestingly, the most investigated tumor suppressor p53 protein also seems to be a genetic buffer [70], which may explain the unexpected survival-promoting effect of wide-type p53 in cancer cells [71]. These genetic buffers decouple the genotype from the phenotype, and they provide robustness to cope with mutation while maintaining a degree of genetic diversity. 5 Drug Discovery Through Signature Screening Advances in genomic research in the past two decades fuelled the expectation that agents that specifically target a single disease-causing molecule—‘‘magic bullets’’—could cure cancer, diabetes, and other complex diseases. The current evidence shows that an expression signature, instead of a single disease-causing molecule, may be a reasonable target for drug development. Two approaches have been applied in this domain: signature screenings in laboratory and in silico. The framework of anticancer drug discovery through signature screening is illustrated in Fig. 6. 5.1 Signature Screening in Laboratory: Gene Expression-Based, High-Throughput Screening Gene expression-based, high-throughput screening (GE-HTS) was developed by Stegmaier et al. to help find relevant small molecules for disease control in a library efficiently [72]. The approach starts with the identification of expression signatures for the biological states of interest (‘‘A’’ vs. ‘‘B’’) using genome-wide 664 J. Yan and W. Gu gene expression profiling. Next, an assay is developed for the high-throughput, low-cost measurement of the signature genes. Then, a small-molecule library is screened for compounds that induce a change from the ‘‘state A’’ to the ‘‘state B’’ signature. Using this approach, they derived a five-gene signature of leukemia differentiation and screened a library of 1,739 bioactive small molecules for com- pounds that induced the expression of the signature genes in a leukemia cell line. Their screening results suggested that DAPH1 (4,5-dianilinophthalimide) is a candidate acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) differentiation-inducing agent. Although DAPH1 was previously identified as an epidermal growth factor recep- tor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor, it has not been developed clinically, thus precluding its evaluation with AML patients. Fortunately, they found that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) can induce myeloid differentiation in AML cell lines and primary patient-derived AML blasts at concentrations that are achievable in humans [73]. Interestingly, EGFR expres- sion was not detected in AML cells, suggesting that gefitinib functions through a previously unrecognized EGFR-independent mechanism. In another study, GE-HTS was used to find candidate drugs able to modulate the activity of some of the oncoproteins (including transcription factors and other previously intractable targets) that drive cancer development. The researchers used expression profiling microarrays to define a 14-gene expression signature that differentiates between Ewing sarcoma cells in which the EWS/FLI fusion protein is on and those in which it is off. They then used this signature to screen a library of about 1,000 chemicals (many already approved for other clinical uses) in a ‘‘ligation-mediated amplification assay’’ with a fluorescent, bead-based detection. The most active modulator of EWS/FLI activity identified by this GE-HTS approach was cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). At levels achievable in people, this compound reduced the abundance of EWS/FLI protein and inhib- ited tumor growth in xenograft model of Ewing sarcoma [74].

With signature and small-molecule libraries being available, two approaches can be applied in the screening of new candidate anticancer drugs: in laboratory and in silico. The in-laboratory method involves the identification of expression signatures and the development of high-throughput, low-cost measurement of signature genes. The in silico method means to perform literature or library search using cancer modules or signatures as targets Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 665 The advantages of this method are the following: (1) GE-HTS does not require development of specialized assays for the measurement of signature genes. The gene expression signature definition, amplification, and detection are generic; and (2) a former knowledge of a target is not needed. The gene expression signature serves as a surrogate for the biological state in question. The method is thus well suited for discovery of modulators of oncogenic transcription factors in which the mutant transcription factor’s transforming mechanism is not known. 5.2 Signature Screening In Silico—Connectivity Map Gene expression signatures have been used to create the Connectivity Map for finding ‘‘connections’’ among small-molecule drugs, genes, and diseases [75]. In this project, expression profiles have been generated from cultured human cells treated with many small-molecule compounds (now 1309 kinds) to create a library of signatures of drug responses. This library of signatures is then used as a database that can be queried by biologists, pharmacologists, chemists, and clinical scientists in the analysis of gene expression data. In this context, the expression signature is represented as a group of gene identities, not by the actual properties of expression that are defined in the experimental setting. The ability of the Connectivity Map database to identify new therapeutic opportunity in cancer treatment has been demonstrated in a recent study on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [76]. Glucocorticoids (GC) are critical to many biological processes and to ALL therapy. By searching the Connective Map database for profiles that coincided with a gene expression signature of GC sensitivity or resistance in ALL cells, the authors found a match target—the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Further experimental assays provided evidence that rapamycin could induce glucocorticoid sensitivity in lymphoid tumor cells and sensitization to apoptosis through the modulation of the antiapoptotic gene MCL1. These findings provide a potential path toward a new therapeutic strategy involving rapamycin and glucocorticoid. Signature screenings in laboratory and in silico can be combined to improve the drug discovery. For example, GE-HTS was carried out for compounds capable of attenuating the aberrant androgen receptor (AR) activation seen in prostate cancer. Two of the hits were celastrol and gedunin, the molecular targets of which were unknown. To determine a potential mechanism of action, the authors treated LNCaP prostate cancer cells with gedunin, generated a expression signature, and then queried the Connectivity Map library for a match. The database returned several matches that suggested gedunin was behaving as a heat-shock protein inhibitor. Further experimentation confirmed that gedunin inhibited heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a key regulator of AR, suggesting Hsp90 inhibition as a strategy for controlling AR activity in prostate cancer [77]. 666 J. Yan and W. Gu 5.3 Module Screening In Silico—Module Map Since tumors can be characterized as combinations of activated and suppressed functional modules in a module map [37], targeted therapies might be developed specifically for a tumor based on changed modules. This hypothesis was tested in vitro by Wong et al. [78]. With a module map for human breast cancers, they found that activation of a poor-prognosis ‘‘wound signature’’ is strongly asso- ciated with induction of both a mitochondria gene module and a proteasome gene module. They proposed glycolysis blockade and proteasome blockade as potential therapeutic strategies for these highly aggressive tumors accordingly. The results showed that the glycolysis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvic acid selectively killed breast cells expressing the mitochondria and wound signatures. In addi- tion, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib selectively killed breast cells expres- sing the wound signature. Thus, gene module maps may provide a new tool for rapid translation of expression signatures in human disease to targeted thera- peutic strategies. 6 Future Directions and Conclusions The advent of microarray technology has opened a new chapter of molecular cancer research. It is clear that gene expression profiling analysis has great potential for improving cancer management and for better understanding of the cancer biology. However, the future fate of microarray technology per se is being challenged by the arrival of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) tech- nologies [79]. Also called ‘‘next-generation DNA sequencing,’’ this technology is based on the concept of cyclic array sequencing that a dense array of DNA features is sequenced by iterative cycles of enzymatic manipulation and ima- ging-based data collection [80]. With this method, genomic or complementary DNA is fragmented and then ligated to common adaptors to construct template libraries through PCR. The PCR amplicons are spatially clustered either to a single location on a planar substrate or to the surface of micrometer-scale beads, which are recovered and arrayed. All array features are then manipu- lated with a single microliter-scale reagent volume and sequenced through imaging-based detection of fluorescent labels incorporated with each extension in parallel. The last several years have witnessed an accelerating application of this technology for a variety of goals including transcriptome profiling [80]. Hybridization-based microarrays have the advantages of a significantly lower workload and a relatively low cost. But the probe collection on a chip presents a hard constraint on its detection power. In contrast, the sequencing-based MPS approaches require more advanced instruments that are more cost- and labor intensive, but they provide in-depth analysis of gene expression profiling, allowing the potential identification of novel mRNAs [81]. It is predicted that microarray approaches may eventually become obsolete if MPS issues Gene Expression Microarrays in Cancer Research 667 regarding genome assembly and annotation, cost, and ease have been worked out [82]. The present coexistence of various DNA microarray platforms and MPS technologies offers biomedical research complementary options for tran- scriptome profiling. Moreover, transcriptional profiling might become less important in future because it measures a biological intermediate that is too volatile and prone to producing interfering artifacts [4]. For the identification of therapeutic targets, RNA changes need to be validated at protein level since RNA might be too far from the actual cellular effectors. The true value of expression signatures requires a demonstration of their utility in the clinical setting. For many cancers, prognostic models based on standard clinicopathological variables already exist, and these expression sig- natures should demonstrate added benefit beyond the best prognostic models already in use today. Unfortunately, the performances of published signatures are much poorer than stated and the predictions are quite discordant. There is no solid evidence for favorable use of any identified expression signatures in clinic [48]. Two commercially available gene expression-based prognostic tests (MammaPrint and OncotypeDX) are currently being assessed in two large randomized clinical trials of breast cancer (TAILORx and MINDACT). In North America, TAILORx is specifically evaluating the usefulness of che- motherapy in intermediate-risk patients estimated with the Oncotype DX test. In the case of MINDACT, ongoing in the European Union, clinical validation of the prognostic test will be considered successful if the proportion of failures among patients classified as having a good prognosis by the MamaPrint test is below a predefined level. But these two trials are not primarily designed to study the clinical usefulness of the signatures [83]. It is obvious that there are many significant challenges facing investigators in the clinical validation of micro- array findings, such as the complexity of biological systems, sample limitation, and variability of data mining methods [84]. Integration of expression data from primary human breast cancers with data obtained from the experimental manipulation of model systems is also a major challenge for microarray trans- lational research [85]. Together with the rapid development of microarray technology, other important high-throughput platforms are being developed to analyze genetic and epigenetic changes in DNA, microRNA, and protein for dissecting the biological complexity of human diseases. It is a current trend to integrate various sources of information to speed up the hunting of responsible genes, modules, and networks in cancer research. For example, Gallegos Ruiz et al. [86] performed a genome-wide screening of chromosomal copy number changes with gene expression arrays in 32 radically resected tumor samples from stage I and II NSCLC patients. They identified a deletion on 14q32.2-33 as a common alteration in NSCLC (44%), which significantly influenced gene expression for Hsp90. This deletion was correlated with better overall survival (P = 0.008), patients whose tumors had lower Hsp90 expression also lived longer. This finding was validated in three independent sets of NSCLC patients. 668 J. Yan and W. Gu Furthermore, in vitro treatment with an Hsp90 inhibitor showed potent anti- proliferative activity in NSCLC cell lines. In another study, Adler et al. used the same strategy to identify genes that may induce the transcription of the prog- nostic ‘‘wound response’’ expression signature in human breast cancer. The amplification of two genes, MYC and CSN5, appeared to be correlated with the wound response cassette. In vitro validation showed that the wound signature could be induced in MCF10A cells only when MYC and CSN5 were coexpressed [87]. It is obvious that the integrative use of all these platforms should allow us to uncover genes and complex conditional interactions embedded in carcinogenesis. In summary, microarray technology is a unique tool for cancer research. Expression profiling has become a new approach to cancer classification. Microarray studies have identified many genes and pathways potentially involved in the development of many common tumors. The emerging systems biology will improve our understanding and interpretation of complicated microarray data. We expect that expression profiling study, together with other high-throughput technologies, will eventually lead to the development of personalized and system-based approaches for optimal management of human cancer.

Gu Clinical Trials and Translational Applications in Cancer Therapy Dineo Khabele and Derrick Beech 1 Introduction Despite the gains that had been made in increasing overall survival and extend- ing disease-free survival rates, cancer is still one of the leading causes of death in the United States [1]. There remains an urgent need for the rapid development of new cancer therapeutics. Unfortunately, only about 5% of new compounds intended for use in cancer therapy are approved for clinical use [2]. The time and enormous costs involved in conducting clinical trials are special barriers to drug development [3, 4]. Careful thought regarding each phase of investigation is critical for the successful and efficient completion and interpretation of a clinical trial and prior to widespread clinical use of a new drug. This chapter focuses on clinical trials in oncology and translational applications. The global objectives of cancer clinical trials are to evaluate promising new agents that may alleviate symptoms and/or cure the disease. As newer agents such as molecular targeted therapies are developed, questions remain as to whether current mod- els of clinical trial design are sufficient. Nevertheless, classic design forms the basis of drug development in cancer therapy. Study objectives and endpoints are associated with specific study designs and determine the level of testing and the number of subjects required for each phase (Fig. 1) [5]. 2 Classic Clinical Trial Design for New Cancer Drugs Guidelines for clinical trials have been established by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [6]. The classic model of clinical trial design takes pharmaceutical compounds that have shown some promise in preclinical experimentation through several levels of testing prior to implementation in clinical practice (Fig. 1). In general, preclinical studies in vitro and in animals D. Beech (*) Professor and Chair, Department of Surgery, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, TN 37208, USA e-mail: dbeech@mmc.edu Y. Lu, R.I. Mahato (eds.), Pharmaceutical Perspectives of Cancer Therapeutics, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0131-6_21, \u0002 Springer ScienceþBusiness Media, LLC 2009 673 are required, in order to apply for a new Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The experimental agent is then tested for safety and efficacy in humans in phase I to phase III trials. Recent changes designed to facilitate cancer drug development and improve upon clinical trials include phase 0, and phase IV designs have been implemented by the FDA in a collaborative pro- gram with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). 2.1 Phase 0 Trials: Exploratory Studies One method to permit early evaluation of new drugs and to more efficiently design subsequent phase I studies is to conduct phase 0 trials [7, 8]. The FDA permits investigation of new compounds with limited preliminary data through the mechanism, exploratory investigational new drug (ExpIND). The new drug can be studied concurrently with preclinical testing, in order to provide additional rationale for further human investigation. In such a trial, very low doses of the new drug are administered to a small cohort, usually 5–15 subjects, for usually less than 7 days to evaluate the mechanism of action of the agent. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are the focus, rather than safety or efficacy. The potential efficacy is evaluated by surrogate biomarkers or specific targets of the treatment. These trials are ideal for compounds that are (1) not highly toxic, (2) have a mechanism of action, and (3) have pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics that can be readily evaluated. However, if the agent has been shown to be toxic in animals, if there is an unclear mechanism of action, or if there are no established pharmacodynamic assays for the drug, it is best to conduct phase I trials. 2.2 Phase I Trials: Toxicity, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamic Studies If phase 0 studies are not conducted, traditionally, the earliest introduction of a new agent into humans is through phase I trials [9]. Phase I studies are designed Fig. 1 The number of patient subjects required and the amount of time needed to complete the study 674 D. Khabele and D. Beech to determine pharmacologic effects, particularly dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as well as route and timing of drug delivery by studying the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. A classic phase I trial is open to patients with different types of cancers and involves several small cohorts (about 3–5 subject per cohort) at different doses of drug. The initial cohort is treated with a dose of the drug that is typically based on a predetermined and much lower percentage of the dose that is lethal in animal studies. Study subjects are observed for toxicity, and if the drug is tolerated, with no DLT or other unacceptable side effect, another cohort is treated with a higher dose. Dose escalation continues with new cohorts of patients until the DLT is reached. Once the DLT is established in more than one patient in a cohort, then the study is halted. The dose that is one dose lower than the DLT is considered the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) and is usually recommended for further study in phase II trials. Phase I studies are critical for development of novel agents. An example is a new histone deacetylase inhibitor (MS-275), which was tested for toxicity and pharmacologic and biological effects of three different oral dosing schedules [10]. The DLTs were hypophosphatemia and weakness observed on the weekly and twice-weekly dosing schedules – but no toxicity on the every other week schedule. Based on this study, the recommended dose for further studies was determined to be 4 mg/m2 given weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days or 2–6 mg/m2 given once every other week. Although not the primary intent of the study, 6 patients showed stable disease and 2 of 27 patients had partial remissions, including one patient with metastatic melanoma who remained on study for >5 years. A key limitation to the classic phase I design is that it runs the risk of too many patients being treated at low, ineffective doses. Another constraint is that efficacy is not an endpoint of phase I trials, and a clinically meaningful benefit cannot be extrapolated from the small number of participants. Although individual responses are often observed and documented as possible surrogates of the new drug’s efficacy, these results must be interpreted with caution [11]. In addition, the subjects in cancer therapeutic phase I studies are not healthy volunteers, unlike clinical trials in other medical specialties, but often heavily pretreated patients with cancers that have not responded to prior therapy. Newer approaches to phase I trials are being developed to allow for more rapid and efficient methods of determining the MTD, treating a larger number of patients at doses in the therapeutic range and reducing the toxicity of higher doses [12–14]. 2.3 Phase II Trials: Response Rates and Toxicity Studies The next level of investigation of a new cancer drug is the phase II study. Phase II trials are primarily designed to assess the efficacy of a new agent and to further evaluate its safety in larger cohorts of patients. The study design of phase II trials builds upon results from preclinical investigations and the MTD Clinical Trials and Translational Applications in Cancer Therapy 675 established in phase I trials. The underlying objective is to determine the drug’s usefulness for future comparative studies to standard treatment. The study population is intended to be more homogenous, e.g., same disease site, unlike phase I trials which are open to a variety of tumor types. Many phase II trials are single-arm nonrandomized studies. If there is a control arm, patients in that group receive standard of care treatment. Some of the issues with phase II trials are as follows: they (1) may expose a large number of patients to inadequate or toxic therapy; (2) take long periods of time to complete; and (3) are expensive. Most studies are designed to incorporate early stopping rules [15]. An interim analysis can be performed before the study is complete and a study stopped early, if there are no observed responses or unacceptable toxicity from the drug (a negative result) or if the responses are high and further testing in phase III trials is justified (a positive result). If the response rate is equivocal, the study is kept open for further accrual. Interim analyses and early stopping rules must be determined prior to initiating the study to limit bias in interpreting the final results. Other strategies are being implemented to make phase II trials more efficient. One example is the multiarm multistage (MAMS) randomized trial design that allows for testing of many different agents at the same time in comparison to a single group of controls [16]. Initially, each experimental arm is compared solely to the control arm. The groups in which the experimental drugs do not show sufficient efficacy are dropped, and the remaining groups are evaluated until the primary outcomes of the study are reached. At the conclusion of the study, all arms undergo evaluation. Phase II trials are critical for determining the utility of proceeding to addi- tional human investigation of a new compound or testing new routes or com- binations of therapy. However, the vast majority of phase II trials are negative studies that do not go to phase III trials [17]. Therefore, new paradigms of study design, particularly with novel molecularly targeted therapy, are needed to bring new compounds to clinical practice. An example of incorporating genomic information into the design of a phase II trial is the recently published evaluation of somatic mutations in the epider- mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [18]. The authors were able to correlate specific EGFR mutations with clinical response to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer. The authors concluded that ‘‘genotype-directed’’ first-line treatment with gefitnib was worthy of further study in a phase III trial. This type of study design will become more important as new molecular targets for cancer therapy are discovered. 2.4 Phase III Trials: Efficacy Studies The gold standard test for new therapeutic agent is the randomized control clinical trial (RCT) that occurs after early phase studies have been completed. Phase III trials are large, usually multicenter studies designed to compare a new agent that 676 D. Khabele and D. Beech showed promise in earlier phase studies to current standard treatment regimens for specific type of cancer. These RCT studies require large-enough numbers of participants to offer sufficient power to detect a statistical difference between treatment arms. Cohorts include hundreds to thousands of participants. Therefore, phase III trials require multiple institutions and sites for target accrual. The primary endpoint in phase III trials is usually progression-free survival, while secondary endpoints usually include response rate and overall survival. An example of a multicenter, cooperative group, randomized phase III trial was the recently published comparison of intravenous paclitaxel plus cisplatin to intravenous paclitaxel plus intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel in patients with stage III ovarian cancer patients with minimal residual disease. The median duration of overall survival in the intravenous-therapy and intraperitoneal- therapy groups was 49.7 and 65.6 months, respectively [19]. Although there was a high toxicity rate, the greater than 60 months overall survival for advanced stage ovarian cancer was an important finding. This study led to new treatment guidelines for newly diagnosed, advanced stage ovarian cancers after optimal tumor debulking surgery. 2.5 Phase IV Trials: Long-Term Toxicity Studies Once the new drug has been approved by the FDA for general clinical use, phase IV trials are conducted to assess long-term side effects. The number of subjects required for phase IV studies is usually in the thousands, and the study period is over a long period of time prospectively. Phase IV trials can be used to evaluate different doses and schedules than those initially tested in phase II and III studies. In addition, other measures such as quality of life indices and cost can be studied. Phase IV trials are difficult to conduct because of the large numbers of subjects required and the fact that they are ongoing. Phase IV studies are by necessity multicenter trials and are implemented typically through cooperative oncology groups. 3 Study Endpoints 3.1 Common Endpoints The endpoints for phase 0 trials are pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and biomarker responses to the new drug. Phase I trials test for safety along with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In phase II through IV trials, com- mon endpoints are clinical measurements of response, toxicity, time to progres- sion or the progression-free interval, and overall survival. Several cooperative oncology groups have objective criteria to measure the severity of adverse events or serious adverse events. Clinical Trials and Translational Applications in Cancer Therapy 677 3.2 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria is the most common method of measuring responses rates for solid tumors, by physical examination and/or radiographic imaging [20]. A complete response is resolution of measurable tumors lasting at least 4 weeks. A partial response is a decrease by at least 30% in the measurable tumors with no new sites of disease. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in measurable disease and/or one or more new sites of disease, and stable disease defines tumors that have not met the criteria for response or progression. The overall response rate in a study is the sum of partial plus complete responses. These guidelines were designed for phase II trials to evaluate efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. However, the applicability of traditional phase II design to the study of compounds that target small molecules (e.g. tyrosine kinases) has been challenged [21]. It has been suggested that for targeted therapies, any endpoint that differentiates the treatment arm from the control can be used as a method for justifying further investigation of the new agent. 3.3 Survival Event-free survival is measured from the time of diagnosis or treatment inter- vention to a defined event, typically overall survival and progression-free survival. The time to event is articulated as a median for the group or as a percentage of the group at a particular time such as the 5-year mark after diagnosis. Clearly, overall survival is a significant endpoint in cancer therapy trials. However, other cancer therapies and confounding factors such as indi- vidual co-morbidities may impact survival. Progression-free survival is often used as an endpoint in phase III trials because it more closely reflects the effects of immediate therapy. Furthermore, in studying cytostatic agents, progression- free survival may be a more appropriate endpoint. 4 Eligibility 4.1 Defining the Study Population Defining the study population is critical in determining the immediate criteria for enrollment in a clinical trial and ultimately, if the results can be applied to the general population. The research question, hypothesis, and study design are used to identify the characteristics of participants who are eligible for the trial. 4.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Eligible subjects are recruited based on a number of factors including particular malignant disease site, stage of disease, performance status, and underlying 678 D. Khabele and D. Beech medical conditions. Potential study participants who are not likely to benefit or who may be at unusually high risk of adverse side effects if enrolled (e.g., renal failure) are excluded. The eligibility and exclusion criteria are typically specific to the condition and treatment under study. Inclusion and exclusion in a study should not be a matter of convenience. For example, a consecutive series of patients from a single clinic site is a sample of convenience and is inherently biased by the nature of the clinic location, patterns of referral, patient popula- tion, and other confounding factors. The process of determining the methods of subject recruitment is important in minimizing statistical bias and in the poten- tial of generalizing the results to the population at large. 5 Statistical Considerations 5.1 Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) In RCT studies, the method of randomization is important in reducing bias. Formal statistical models of probability are the best method of assigning subjects. It is important that the assignment to a particular study arm is made after the participant’s eligibility is established and informed consent has been obtained. A double-blind study is designed to hide which treatment is being adminis- tered from both the study participants and the treating physicians. Ideally, to eliminate as much bias as possible in a double-blind study, all personnel involved with the participant’s treatment, data collection, data management, and analysis should be blinded. A single-blind study in which the study group assignment is unknown to either the study participant or the treating physician is still subject to bias. An open-label study where assignments are known to study participants, treating physicians, and study personnel is the most biased study design, and the results should be interpreted in this context. The gold standard is a double blind, RCT. However, single institution studies may be a practical initial approach for small exploratory investigations. 5.2 Sample Size, Power, and Significance In order to calculate the number of participants required for the study or the sample size, the investigator must know the desired power, significance level, and expected magnitude of the effect to be observed. The statistical power of a clinical study is the probability of detecting a difference in the effect of the investigational drug, compared to standard treatment, if indeed a true differ- ence exists. The complement of power (1 – power) is the probability of failing to find an effect when one does exist, a false negative or type II or b error. Common values for type II error are 0.2 (or 1 in 5) and 0.1 (or 1 in 10), which Clinical Trials and Translational Applications in Cancer Therapy 679 correspond to power of 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. The study significance level is the probability of detecting an apparent effect when none exists, and differences observed are the result of chance, a type I error. Common values for a false positive or type I a error are 0.05 (1 in 20) and 0.01 (1 in 100). Increases in type I and II errors and low power are observed with small sample size. On the other hand, if a sample size is too large, there is an increased chance of subjecting study participants to unnecessary risk, wasting resources, and prolonging the study duration. Furthermore, too large of a sample size may be statistically significant, but clinically irrelevant. Early stopping rules are determined a priori by statisticians and clinical investigators to ensure the study design takes into account the statistical considerations as well as the pathogenesis and clinical progression of individual types of cancer. 5.3 The Null Hypothesis Comparisons are most frequently made to determine whether there is a differ- ence between treatments, or between treatment and control, with respect to the null hypothesis (the premise that there is no difference between the two condi- tions) [22]. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected if any difference is seen. Theoretically, the tests are two sided. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the observed value is greater or less than the null value (i.e., if any difference is observed). It can be argued that for practical purposes, however, a new cancer treatment is of interest only if it changes clinical practice by having a favorable effect on the patient’s prognosis. Tests to determine whether a treatment changes a parameter relative to the null hypothesis that it causes no change or decreases (increases) the parameter are referred to as one sided because the null hypothesis is rejected only if the effect is in one direction. One-sided hypotheses have greater power with smaller numbers of observations but produce less information about the relation between treatments. They also are open to overgeneralization of positive results if the directionality of the test is misinter- preted. This one-sided hypothesis is in contrast to the two-sided hypothesis in which the new therapy could be worse than standard of care. Testing the two- sided hypothesis requires a much larger sample size. However, typically one is most interested in the new agent performing better than standard therapy. Thus, most studies test the null hypothesis that the response rate is less than expected and the alternative hypothesis that the response rate is greater than anticipated. The expected value is determined by statisticians. Determining the magnitude of expected response a priori is critical. A difference of 15–20% response rate between the investigational drug and standard treatment in solid tumors can typically be achieved. A larger differ- ence is not likely to be observed clinically but requires a smaller number of patients. If the response rate of the standard of care is close to 50%, detection of a difference from the new treatment requires more patients than if the rate is at much higher or lower extremes. 680 D. Khabele and D. Beech 6 Ethical Considerations 6.1 The Ethical Basis for Clinical Trials Ethical considerations must be applied from the design to the completion of a clinical trial. Clear scientific hypotheses and objectives are critical. It is difficult to justify a clinical study if it is not clinically important or relevant. There are added ethical considerations for cancer patients, many of whom have been heavily pretreated with other chemotherapy agents and many of whom are terminally ill and may not derive any direct benefit from the agent being studied, particularly in phase 0 and I trials [23]. Clinical trials are conducted under guidelines issued in the Belmont Report of 1978 that protects human subjects and follows principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Scientific conduct is also guided by ethical principles in that competent and rigorous analysis is required to prevent compromise of the results [24]. 6.2 Special and Vulnerable Populations The NCI has a policy for inclusion of women and minorities to ensure that research findings can be applicable to all those at risk of the disease. Women have historically been excluded from clinical trials. Emerging information shows that dosing and toxicity may differ in men and women [25]. In addition, recent data suggest that molecular markers may have differential implications based on gender. For example, observed polymorphisms in the EGFR have opposite effects on overall prognosis in men and women [26]. Information about ethnicity and race is also important for clinical trials. The response to chemotherapy in African-American women may be affected by the fact that the basal type ‘‘triple negative’’ breast cancers are more prevalent among black women [27]. Minorities in general are underrepresented in clinical trials. The reasons are complex and include lack of access to care, lack of information and awareness, and mistrust of the medical establishment [28, 29]. Furthermore, minorities are often not offered an opportunity to enroll in trials. Strategies to include minorities in clinical trials are to increase access and awareness and to offer minorities a chance to participate in trials [30]. In addition, the use of patient navigators as suggested for improving cancer care among minorities [31] may facilitate minority access and involvement in clinical trials. Children and prisoners are considered to be vulnerable populations because of issues of potential ethical issues related to informed consent and coercion. Participation in clinical trials is permitted for vulnerable populations, but only if the risks of the trial are minimal. Finally, cancer patients in general can be considered vulnerable because many subjects are terminally ill by the time they enroll in clinical trials [23]. It is important to be aware of the potential ethical issues and similar to other vulnerable populations, minimize the risks and ensure proper informed consent. Clinical Trials and Translational Applications in Cancer Therapy 681 7 Challenges and Future Prospects for Translation of Clinical Trials In an era of exciting and promising discovery of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer, it is important to make sure that clinical trials are con- ducted in such a way that the ultimate results have meaning for those affected by the disease. An understanding of the classic study designs of clinical trials is important in bringing new therapeutic agents from preclinical investigation to the clinic. However, as the complexity of treatment strategies increases such as with combination chemotherapy and with novel molecular targets for treat- ment, clinical trial design will need to adapt to such changes. More rapid methods of moving from discovery to clinical delivery will be required. At the same time, attention to including diverse populations affected by specific can- cers is important for the widest applicability of the research findings. Finally, with newer and more complex treatment strategies for cancer, there may be new emphasis on endpoints other than overall survival, such as maintaining stable disease, improving quality of life, and analysis of cost.
