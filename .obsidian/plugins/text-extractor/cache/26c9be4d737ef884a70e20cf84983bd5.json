KGaA, Weinheim 7497wileyonlinelibrary.com living cells, such as neutrophile granu- locytes, [ 13,14 ] has stimulated considerable interest in developing chemically powered synthetic motors that mimic the behavior of natural cells to achieve various complex functions. [ 15–19 ] For these synthetic motors, their chemical propulsion has commonly relied on different types of fuels, including hydrogen peroxide, [ 20–26 ] hydrazine, [ 27 ] strong acids or bases, [ 28–30 ] and bromine/ iodine. [ 31 ] Considerable recent attention has been given to water-powered magne- sium-based motors since water represents the ideal fuel for most practical applica- tions of synthetic micro/nanomotors. [ 32–35 ] To implement sophisticated function- alities onto synthetic subjects, new bio- mimetic systems that harness natural cell functions have been introduced recently, as was demonstrated by coating synthetic nanoparticles with cell membrane derived directly from natural cells. [ 36,37 ] These biomimetic particles have demonstrated impressive potential applications, ranging from systemic drug delivery to removal of toxins and to effective vaccine develop- ment. [ 38–40 ] These recent advances suggest that integrating cell membranes to syn- thetic micro/nanomotors may bestow some unprecedented properties to the motors that are otherwise difﬁ cult to achieve with purely synthetic motors. The objective of the present work is to develop and charac- terize a red blood cell (RBC) membrane-functionalized magne- sium-based (RBC-Mg) Janus micromotor that is powered solely by water. The biomimetic RBC-Mg Janus motors are prepared by selectively assembling RBC membranes onto one side of Mg particles using the paraﬁ lm method. The self-propulsion of the motors is based on the spontaneous Mg–water reaction that pro- duces hydrogen bubbles. The unique functions and advantages of the RBC-Mg Janus motors are demonstrated in operation in protein-rich biological media and detoxiﬁ cation protocols using model protein toxins and chemical warfare agents. The cell- mimicking RBC-Mg Janus motor thus acts as decoy to attract, capture, and neutralize toxins in biological ﬂ uids. In addition, the materials of the RBC-Mg motor, including magnesium, chitosan, gold nanoparticles, and alginate, along with the Mg 2+ byproduct, are well known to be biocompatible, indicating that the RBC-Mg Janus motor will not cause adverse or toxic effects. The results testify the advanced functions and robust- ness of the new water-powered RBC-Mg micromotors, which Water-Powered Cell-Mimicking Janus Micromotor Zhiguang Wu , Jinxing Li , Berta Esteban-Fernández de Ávila , Tianlong Li , Weiwei Gao , Qiang He , Liangfang Zhang , * and Joseph Wang * Cell derivatives have received increasing attention due to their unique ability to mimic many of the natural properties displayed by their source cells. Integration of cell-derived natural materials with synthetic subjects can be applied toward the development of novel biomedical nano/microscale devices for a wide range of applications, including drug delivery and biodetoxiﬁ cation. Herein, a cell membrane functionalized magnesium-based Janus micromotor, powered by water, that mimics natural motile cells is reported. The new cell-mimicking Janus micromotor is constructed by integrating red blood cell (RBC) membranes, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and alginate (ALG) onto the exposed surface areas of magnesium microparticles that are partially embedded in Paraﬁ lm. The resulting RBC membrane-coated magnesium (RBC-Mg) Janus micromotors display an efﬁ cient and guided propulsion in water without any external fuel, as well as in biological (albumin-rich) media with no apparent biofouling, mimicking the movement of natural motile cells. The effective RBC membrane coating bestows the RBC-Mg Janus micromotors with unique capability for absorbing and neutralizing both biological protein toxins and nerve agent simulants. Such detoxiﬁ cation ability is facilitated greatly by the water-driven motion of the motors. The RBC-Mg Janus micromotors represent an exciting progress toward cell- mimicking microscale motors that hold great promise for diverse biomedical and biodefense applications.

Introduction Nature has been a constant source of inspiration for scientists and engineers to design and develop synthetic structures that mimic the complexity and functionalities of biological sys- tems. The fabrication of versatile artiﬁ cial micro/nanomotors, possessing advanced mobility and biological functions, rep- resents an exciting yet challenging task in the ﬁ eld of nano- biotechnology.

Results and Discussion The fabrication process of the RBC-Mg Janus micromotors is schematically illustrated in Figure 1 A. In the ﬁ rst step, a layer of Mg particles with a diameter of 10–20 µm was dispersed onto a Paraﬁ lm-coated glass slide. Upon the spray coating, the Mg particles were partially embedded into the Paraﬁ lm and the remaining area of the particles was exposed for subsequent fabrication processes. This would result in an asymmetric motor structure, namely Janus motor. Speciﬁ cally, the Paraﬁ lm (containing the embedded Mg particles) was consecutively immersed into a chitosan-stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) solution and an alginate (ALG) solution. The AuNPs (diameter: 30–60 nm), which are responsible for efﬁ cient propulsion by performing a macrogalvanic corrosion of the oxide passiva- tion layer on the Mg surface, [ 32 ] possess a high surface tension and thus intend to adsorb onto the Mg particles to minimize the system’s free energy. A negatively charged ALG layer was subsequently assembled onto the positively charged AuNPs surface, forming the shell coating of the Mg motors. Next, preformed RBC membrane-derived vesicles (diameter: 50–100 nm) were added to the system, to fuse onto the outer ALG surface layer. The negatively charged ALG layer favors the interaction with the less negative cytoplasmic side of the RBC membrane, resulting in a thin RBC membrane coating with a right-side-out orientation on the AuNP/ALG-covered Mg particles. Finally, well-separated RBC-Mg Janus motors were obtained after partial dissolution of the Paraﬁ lm in tetrahydro- furan. Note that tetrahydrofuran may cause negligible adverse effect on the membrane proteins, [ 41 ] indicating that the function of natural RBC membrane is well preserved on the RBC-Mg Janus motors. The resulting RBC-Mg Janus motors were stable in HEPES buffer solution (pH 8.5), where the magnesium par- ticles are not dissolved and the functional biomolecules (mainly proteins) are stable under weak alkaline conditions. The RBC-Mg motors have high dispersity in aqueous media, with the high negative charge of the RBC membrane preventing aggregation of the particles by electrostatic repulsion. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 1 B displays the resulting RBC-Mg Janus motor with spherical geometry (≈20 µm) and a small circular opening (≈2 µm). The small hole is attributed to the portion of the surface of the Mg particles embedded in the Paraﬁ lm during their coating with the RBC/AuNP/ALG layer. Fluorescently labeled RBC membranes were employed to verify the successful coating of the motors with the cell membranes. A red ﬂ uorescence is clearly observed on the outer surface of the RBC-Mg Janus motor in Rhodamine B (RhB) channel (Figure 1 C). Importantly, no ﬂ uorescence signal is observed from the opening area of the motor, indicating successful coating of the RBC membranes only on the exposed portion of the Mg particles, which resulted in the formation of asymmetric RBC-Mg Janus motors. In addition, because of the nature of layer-by-layer technique, the RBC content in the resulting coating can be tuned by sequential assembly of the alginate and RBC vesicle layers. The highly efﬁ cient locomotion of the RBC-Mg Janus motors involves the bubble propulsion mechanism which utilizes hydrogen bubbles produced from the spon- taneous redox reaction of Mg and water ( Figure 2 A). The macrogalvanic corrosion of the RBC-Mg Janus motors with AuNPs and pitting corrosion of coexisting chloride ions result in efﬁ cient formation of hydrogen bub- bles, which is essential for the continuous propulsion of the motors. [ 32,42 ] Figure 2 B shows a microscopy image, captured from Video S1 (Supporting Information), cor- responding to the random movement of an RBC-Mg Janus motor in a 0.08 M NaCl solu- tion. It could be clearly observed that the gen- eration, growth, and detachment of hydrogen bubbles occurred on the opening hole of the RBC-Mg Janus motor.

KGaA, Weinheim motor over a 2 s period, with an average speed of 172 µm s −1 . The drag force of the micromotor was estimated to be 2 pN by using the Stokes drag theory. Bare Mg Janus motor (without RBC membrane coating) displayed similar movement with negligible change of speed (165 µm s −1 ) under the same experi- mental conditions (Figure 2 C), indicating that the RBC-mem- brane coverage had a negligible effect upon the reaction of Mg and water and hence propulsion efﬁ ciency. Controlled movement of the RBC-Mg Janus motor can be achieved through the incorporation of additional negatively charged Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles into the multilayered coating of the motor via electrostatic attraction (see Experimental Sec- tion in the Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 2 D and the corresponding Video S1 (Supporting Information), the resulting Fe 3 O 4 -loaded RBC-Mg Janus motor can be navigated precisely along predeﬁ ned trajectories under external magnetic guidance. A “U” turn tra- jectory of the RBC-Mg motor can thus be observed while the motor is moving at speed of 160 µm s −1 . Such magnetically guided motion of RBC-Mg Janus motor holds con- siderable promise for biomedical applica- tions of the motors, for instance, cancer cell isolation, targeted drug delivery, or removal of toxins (which will be discussed below). One important feature of the RBC-Mg Janus motor lies in its antifouling capability that facilitates efﬁ cient propulsion in bio- logical ﬂ uids. The RBC membrane coverage shields the motor from protein fouling effects when subjected to biological ﬂ uids, taking advantage of the antifouling property of RBCs ( Figure 3 Aa). Figure 3 Ab shows the efﬁ cient movement of the RBC-Mg motor in albumin-rich medium with a speed of 33 µm s −1 . While this speed is lower than the 172 µm s −1 observed in water (due to the increased viscosity of the solution), such pro- pulsion is sufﬁ cient for conducting various tasks in biological environments. In contrast, severe protein fouling rapidly occurs on the surface of the bare Mg motor (without RBC membrane coating), dramatically hindering the Mg–water reaction, the generation of hydrogen bubbles and thus the propulsion efﬁ ciency (Figure 3 Ba,b). The corresponding Video S2 (Sup- porting Information) shows the minor bubble formation, with no directional propulsion of the bare Mg Janus motor in the albumin solution. Further, we demonstrated that the function of cell-mimicking RBC-Mg Janus motors as a decoy to attract, capture, and neu- tralize toxins in biological ﬂ uids, while the RBC membrane sur- face prevents nonspeciﬁ c adsorption of common plasma pro- teins. To examine the detoxiﬁ cation capability of the RBC-Mg Janus motors, we selected a well-documented cell membrane- damaging toxin, α-toxin, and mixed it with the RBC-Mg Janus motors in a 5% albumin solution. The detoxiﬁ cation capability of the RBC-Mg Janus motors for absorbing and neutralizing the α-toxin are achieved by camouﬂ aging natural red blood cells. Such RBC-camouﬂ aging Janus motor can be used as Adv. Funct. Mater. 2015, 25, 7497–7501 www.afm-journal.de www.MaterialsViews.com Figure 2.

Similar to the propul- sion observed in albumin solution, the RBC-Mg Janus motor displayed a random motion in the α-toxin/albumin solution, preserving a hollow shell structure after the Mg core was com- pletely dissolved ( Figure 4 A). Such structure was able to retain the absorbed α-toxin and neutralize its virulence, thereby, pro- tecting cells from damaging by the toxins. Equal amounts of PBS buffer, bare Mg motors (without RBC membrane coating), and RBC membrane-coated SiO 2 particles (without movement), were employed as controls and tested in parallel to the RBC-Mg Janus motors by incubating with the α-toxin for 5 min fol- lowed by adding 1.5 mL of 2 vol% RBCs to each formulation. As shown in Figure 4 B, the incubation of α-toxin and RBC-Mg Janus motors resulted in a clean supernatant compared to the control groups, indicating the effectiveness of the coated RBC membranes in absorbing toxins and the importance of the motor propulsion in accelerating the detoxiﬁ cation process. The detoxiﬁ cation efﬁ ciency was further quantiﬁ ed by meas- uring the absorption of the released hemoglobin (540 nm), deﬁ ned as relative hemolysis (Figure 4 C). The treatment of bare Mg Janus motors displayed a negligible decrease of the relative hemolysis as compared with the treatment of PBS. This was likely attributed to the absence of RBC membranes and the albumin fouling effect on the bare motors, which might block the nonspeciﬁ c adsorption of α-toxin onto the motors. In contrast, a sharp decrease of relative hemolysis down to 48% and 9% was observed in samples treated with RBC-coated SiO 2 particles and RBC-Mg Janus motors, respectively. The comparison between the treatment with RBC-Mg Janus motors and RBC-coated SiO 2 particles shows that the water-powered propulsion signiﬁ cantly enhanced the detoxiﬁ cation efﬁ ciency. Moreover, a higher detoxiﬁ cation capacity was achieved by increasing the concen- tration of RBC-Mg motors over the range of 0–0.8 mg mL −1 , showing that the relative hemolysis decreased from 78% without RBC-Mg Janus motors to 9% using motor concentra- tion of 0.8 mg mL −1 (Figure 4 D). To expand the potential detoxiﬁ cation of the RBC-Mg motor toward diverse environmental remediation, we further tested its decontamination ability against a nerve agent simulant, methyl- paraoxon, in albumin solution. Organophosphorus agents are known to interact with RBC and to inhibit the acetylcholinest- erase on RBC membranes. [ 43 ] Thus, the acetylcholinesterase presents in the RBC membranes of the magnesium motor, is able to absorb and remove the paraoxon. The UV–vis absorb- ance spectra in Figure 4 E shows that RBC-Mg motors were able to reduce the level of the nerve agent simulant by 90.0% as com- pared to the PBS sample, while the corresponding nonmotor RBC-SiO 2 particles neutralized about 38.2% of the agent. Appar- ently, the water-driven motion of the RBC membrane coating improves the speed of the decontamination process. 3. Conclusions We have presented the ﬁ rst example of cell-mimicking water- powered micromotors based on cell membrane-coated magne- sium microparticles. The bioinspired motors were prepared by the assembly of RBC membranes onto magnesium particles, resulting in efﬁ cient propulsion in water and biological media without the need for external fuels or ﬁ elds. The cell membrane coating shielded the motor from protein fouling effects when the motors are operated in a biological ﬂ uid. The resulting cell- mimicking RBC-Mg Janus motors act as decoys that attract and neutralize toxins. The potential application of the RBC-Mg motors has been demonstrated toward rapid detoxiﬁ cation of α-toxin and methyl-paraoxon, models of membrane-damaging toxins and chemical warfare agents, respectively. The same synthesis proce- dure could be extended to various other types of cell membranes, Adv. Funct. Mater. 2015, 25, 7497–7501 www.afm-journal.de www.MaterialsViews.com Figure 4.
