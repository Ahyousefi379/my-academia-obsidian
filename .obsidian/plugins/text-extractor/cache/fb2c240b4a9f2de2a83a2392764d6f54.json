Hydrogel is suitable biomaterial to supply niche for cells adhesion and survival. This study constructed a functional injectable thermo-sensitive hydrogel (chitosan/glycerol phosphate sodium/cellu- lose nanocrystals, CS/GP/CNC) encapsulated hUCMSCs to repair full-thickness cutaneous wound. Addition of CNC to the CS/GP system not only accelerated the gel speed, but also greatly improved the mechanical properties of the gel and decreased degradation rate. The novel hydrogel was injectable and low toxicity. Histological detection showed that hydrogel-hUCMSCs combination signiﬁcantly accelerated wound closure, microcirculation, tissue remodeling, re-epithelialization and hair follicle regeneration, and inhibited over-inﬂammation in the central and surrounding wounds. The hydrogel-hUCMSCs combination promoted collagen deposition and keratinocyte mature marker K1 expression, decreased inﬂammatory factors secretion namely TNF-α and IL-1β.The present data provides a potential strategy for treatment of non-healing chronic cutaneous wounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Cutaneous wounds repair is major challenge especially for server trauma, burn and diabetic foot ulcer [1]. Normal wound healing is a dy- namic and complex process involving a series of coordinated events, in- cluding bleeding and coagulation, acute inﬂammation, cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and syn- thesis and remodeling of extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins [2]. These complex events occur in three overlapping phases: (a) inﬂammatory, (b) proliferative, and (c) remodeling [2]. Central to this process is the endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which coordinates the re- pair response by recruiting other host cells and secreting growth factors and matrix proteins [3]. In recent years, transplanting stem cells have been extensively suggested the positive efﬁciency to repair cutaneous wounds [4–10]. However, further studied are necessary to solve prob- lems, such as insufﬁcient amount, immunological rejection, low survival and short local stay. Human umbilical cord-mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) have a painless collection procedure, faster self-renewal properties and low immunogenicity, more promising than other MSCs [11–13]. Re- searchers have proven that hUCMSCs have powerful effects on promot- ing wound repair. HUCMSCs treatment showed signiﬁcant increase in neovessels, re-epithelization and generation of skin appendages after epithelization, no serious complications or adverse reactions associated with the treatment [14,15]. Conventional dressing such as cotton medical gauze and biological dressings including pork skin have unavoidable disadvantages, such as frequent change, limiting application. Alternatively, injectable thermo- sensitive hydrogels are easy to use especially to irregularly surfaced wounds. So, they can avoid secondary trauma. Moreover, they can maintain water and body ﬂuid, even promote remarkable neovascular- ization and skin regeneration, depend on their good biocompatibility International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 137 (2019) 433–441 ⁎ Corresponding authors.

What's more, hydrogels have the porous in- ternal structure. Suitable microenvironment, like ECM, is beneﬁtfor transplanted stem cells adhesion and survival [19,21,22]. Some studies tried to combine matrix with stem cells and found stem cell-seeded dermal matrix or hydrogel was an effective means for targeted in vivo cell delivery for enhanced soft tissue regeneration and hair growth, possibly by retaining the cells at the wound site for longer [23–25]. These researches found that engineering ﬁbrin hydrogels promoted the wound healing potential of MSCs spheroids [26]. Moreover, hydrogel-bone marrow MSCs or -adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) combination showed signiﬁcant promotion of wound closure, epithelial cells' proliferation and re-epithelialization, and reduced inﬂammatory responses in the server wound like diabetic ulcers and burn [17,21,27–30]. The combination therapy can promote collagen deposition, TGF-β1 and bFGF secretion and tissue remodeling, providing a potential way for infected wound treatment with high- quality and efﬁcient scar inhibition [17,31]. What's more, ability for in- jection of hydrogel was beneﬁt in minimally-invasive surgeries, also without ﬁxture for wound repair [21,32,33]. These hydrogel synthesis from hyperbranched multi-acrylated poly(ethylene glycol) macromers (HP-PEGs) and thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH), dextran-hyaluronic acid (Dex-HA), Pluronic F-127, chitosan (CS), methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) and methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) and so on [17,21,24,28,29,34]. Chitosan/glycerol phosphate sodium (CS/GP)-based hydrogels have good biocompatibility as well as biodegradability and are good cell and drug carriers. In particular, the unique thermo-sensitive effect of CS/GP allows it to be used to prepare injectable hydrogels. However, it has some shortcomings, such as poor mechanical properties, and the degra- dation rate does not meet the requirements [35,36]. Therefore, CS/GP hydrogel should broaden its scope of application. The research should focus on modifying the CS/GP hydrogel or adding new components to construct a new gel system. One of the ways is to physically cross-link other natural or synthetic materials, such as collagen [37], graphene [38], etc., to construct a new gel system that meets the requirements. It has been studied to mix CS/GP with different proportions of collagen to obtain a series of chitosan/collagen ratio hydrogels, and to evaluate the application performance of the mixed hydrogel in tissue engineering [37]. There also had a study that added 0.5% (w/v) graphene oxide (GO) to the CS/GP system to improve the physicochem- ical properties of the hydrogel [38]. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) have a high speciﬁc surface area, excellent mechanical properties, biodegrad- ability and other excellent properties. It can be a physically enhanced nanoparticle [39,40]. In this study, a series of ratios of new injectable thermo-sensitive hydrogels were obtained by mixing different ratios of CNC and CS/GP, and we also performed a related characterization of the hydrogels. From the gel speed and mechanical properties, we ﬁnally selected the CS/GP/2.0CNC hydrogel for the next skin repair model. The hUCMSCs were encapsulated with the hydrogel to explore the effect of full-thickness wound repair in the rat model by histological and molec- ular biological methods. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Xu et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 137 (2019) 433–441 drop by drop in ice. Stirring was continued for 10 min to obtain a homo- geneous gel solution. The pH of the solution was measured and then placed in a 37 °C con- stant temperature water bath, and CS/GP gel was obtained (Fig. 1A). The gel time and the CNC content (w/v %) were shown in appended Table S1. 2.3. Characterization of thermo-sensitive gel The CS/GP/CNC thermo-sensitive gels were characterized by scan- ning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transforms infrared spec- troscopy (FTIR), the detailed information as following. The thermo- sensitive gel was made into a lyophilized stent, and the sample was ﬁxed on a copper plate to spray gold, and then the pore size and surface morphology of the gel stent were observed by a SEM. A Thermo Scien- tiﬁc IR100 FT-IR Spectrometer recorded FTIR spectra. Gels were freeze dried in order to remove the residual chemicals. Then dried gels were grinded to powder, mixed with KBr, and compressed into pellets, then FTIR spectra were performed. 2.4. Characterization of hydrogel physical properties 2.4.1. Rheological characterization of thermo-sensitive gels The ﬁve thermo-sensitive gels prepared were characterized by two modes of rotational rheometer: temperature mode, viscosity mode. The temperature mode was that temperature rose from 25 °C to 45 °C by 0.5 °C/min. The viscosity mode set the shear rate from 0.1 s−1 to 400 s −1, and the temperature at 25 °C and 37 °C. The remaining param- eters are default parameters. 2.4.2. Characterization of compressive modulus of thermo-sensitive gels The thermo-sensitive gel was made into a lyophilized stent, and then the diameter and height of the stent were measured. The universal pressure tester was set to a compression distance of 3.0 mm and a com- pression rate of 0.0167 mm/s. The pressure of the stent was measured as a function of the compression distance. The post-collection data was used to calculate the compression modulus of the gel. 2.4.3. Characterization of in vitro degradation of thermo-sensitive gels The thermo-sensitive gel was made into a lyophilized stent, im- mersed in the prepared PBS buffer, and placed in a constant tempera- ture shaker at 37 °C. The gel stent was taken out at intervals to wash and weigh with absolute ethanol, and then the degradation solution was replaced. Continued to immerse the gel holder in it and shook it at 37 °C. The degradation rate was calculated by the following formula [34]. Degradation rate (t)% = (W0 − Wt) / W0 × 100%, W0: initial gel dry weight, Wt: degradation of the dry weight of the gel at time t. 2.5. Hydrogel toxicity analysis Cytotoxicity tests of hydrogels were performed by CCK-8 assay, as previously described [41]. The hydrogels with gradient CNC was pre- treated by culture media in a 37 °C incubator for 24 h for extraction. The supernatant was collected, and ﬁlter sterilized as 100% hydrogel ex- tracts. The extractions were used to culture the hUCMSCs respectively. The culture medium was aspirated for 1 day or 2 days, containing 100 μL of 10% CCK8 solution (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The CCK8 solution was removed after 2 h in a dark incubation environment under the same culture conditions. The absorbance of each sample at 450 nm Fig. 4.

Xu et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 137 (2019) 433–441 was then read immediately from the microplate reader (GENios; TECAN, Atlanta, GA, USA). 2.6. Culture and encapsulation of hUCMSCs HUCMSCs were prepared by the Lanri biotechnology co., LTD as re- ported [42]. Brieﬂy, Wharton's jelly from human umbilical cords was excised, minced into pieces of 0.5–1.0 mm 3 using scissors and scalpels, and washed twice with PBS. The tissue pieces were plated in DMEM/ F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were then puriﬁed and identiﬁed (Fig. S1). The hydrogel and the hUCMSCs were mixed to homogeneity on ice for detection or transplantation. 2.7. Wound model Twenty adult speciﬁc-pathogen-free (SPF)-class SD rats were pur- chased from Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Med- ical College Institute of Biomedical Engineering. Standard anesthesia procedure with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg) was performed before dorsal hair shaved. Four round- shaped (8 mm diameter) incisions penetrating the subcutaneous tissue were created. Four incisions of each rat were divided into four treat- ments to inject respectively 100 μL PBS, hUCMSCs, hydrogel or hydrogel-hUCMSCs combination. HUCMSCs amount was 5 × 10 6. The wound changes were measured at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. Wound healing was expressed as the percentage of healed wound area (the original wound area subtracted remained exposed). Exposed areas of the wounds were obtained using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.8. Histological observations All tissues were collected postoperatively on 3rd, 7th, 14th and 21st day, rinsed in PBS, and then ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and then embedded in parafﬁn for routine haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) including TNF-α, IL-1β and keratin 1 (K1). The stained sections were observed using an optical microscope (BO-M30; AOSVI, Shenzhen, China). 2.9. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of at least three replicates. All statistical computations were performed using SPSS software (ver. 13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences with a value of *p b 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Synthesis of the thermo-sensitive hydrogel The particle size of the CNC crystal prepared by the acid hydrolysis method was mainly distributed between 400 and 800 nm (Fig. S2A). By the previous method, CS/GP/2.0CNC thermo-sensitive gel was suc- cessfully synthesized by adding CNC to the CS/GP system (Fig. 1A). The scaffold aperture was mainly distributed between 20 and 50 μm under SEM, and a tight network structure was observed of CS/GP/ 2.0CNC (Fig. 1B), 40–80 μm of CS/GP/0.5–1.5CNC (Fig. S2B). The infrared absorption spectrum of CS/GP/2.0CNC was basically the same as that of CS/GP, and it had all the characteristic peaks of CS and GP (Fig. 1C). It also had a bending vibrational peak at 1402 cm−1 and 1396 cm −1, which was the CNC's bending vibrational peak of\\\\O\\\\H. In addition, it had no other new absorption peaks, indicating that the gel mechanism of CS/GP/2.0CNC was still physically crosslinked. This in- dicates that the CS/GP/CNC gel system can gel in the human body without causing drastic changes of body heat and producing new chemicals. The CS/GP/CNC gel system has good injection safety. 3.2. Characterization of the thermo-sensitive hydrogel The initial gel temperature of the CS/GP was 37 °C, while the initial gel temperature of CS/GP/2.0CNC drops to about 32.5 °C, and the storage modulus G′ of CS/GP/2.0CN was signiﬁcantly higher than that of CS/GP (Fig. 1D and E). This indicates that the addition of CNC to the CS/GP sys- tem not only accelerates the gel speed, but also greatly improves the mechanical properties of the gel. Moreover, the more CNC was added to the CS/GP system, the lower the initial gel temperature and the more pronounced mechanical improvement can be obtained (Fig. S3). At room temperature 25 °C (Fig. 1F) and 37 °C (Fig. 1G), both CS/GP sys- tem and CS/GP/CNC system have shear thinning characteristics, which can be used to prepare injectable hydrogels. The mechanical properties of CS/GP gels are very poor, which is often an important factor limiting its applications. The addition of CNC improved the mechanical performance of CS/GP and was signiﬁcantly improved at 2.0% CNC (Fig. 1H). The degradation rates of the ﬁve gels were very close in the ﬁrst 5 days and the degradation rates were fast (Fig. 1I). This is because excess GP in the gel system that does not partic- ipate in the gel process dissolves rapidly in PBS, resulting in a rapid de- crease in dry weight of the gel. After 5 days of degradation, the degradation of the gel is mainly achieved by the gel collapse process. This process is due to the breakdown of various hydrogen and hydro- phobic bonds in the gel, and the degradation rate begins to slow down. However, due to the enhancement of the CNC, the degradation of the CS/GP/CNC gel is slower than the CS/GP gel. The CS/GP/2.0CNC gel degraded relatively slowly, but still had good degradability. 3.3. Hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment accelerates wound closure Before transplant, hydrogel toxicity analysis was carried out, that showed no signiﬁcant difference among gels with different concentra- tion CNC and control (Fig. 2A). Introduce of CNC did not affect hydrogel system biosafety. Sealing the wound is the ﬁrst consideration. Wound closure rates were ﬁrst analyzed at different time points. Results showed that 3 and 7 days after transplantation, the two groups involved hUCMSCs accelerated the wound closure, and that the wound-healing rates of hydrogel-hUCMSCs combination treatment were signiﬁcantly higher than that of hydrogel-alone (p b 0.05) or the control treatment (p b 0.05) on 3 days (Fig. 2B and C). There was no difference on 14 and 21 days for almost completely closure. These results indicate hydrogel-hUCMSCs combination accelerates the process of closure. 3.4. Hydrogel- hUCMSCs combined treatment inhibits inﬂammatory response Next, we examined the effect of hydrogel- hUCMSCs combination in three phases of wound healing. The ﬁrst is inﬂammatory phase. It's re- ported that hUCMSCs showing immunosuppressive functions in vivo [12]. Inﬂammatory factors were detected in this study. Researchers have found that hUCMSCs injections inhibited TNF-α in a rat model which attenuated myocardial ﬁbrosis and dysfunction [43]. The primary role of TNF is in the regulation of immune cells. TNF can induce fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, inﬂammation and respond to sepsis via IL-1 and IL-6 producing cells. The histological results in this study showed the TNF-α and IL-1β protein of the hydrogel-hUCMSCs com- bined treatment were lower than that of the hydrogel or hUCMSCs alone group and the control both on 3rd and 7th day (Figs. 3 and 4). These results showed that the combined treatment of hydrogel with hUCMSCs could inhibit inﬂammatory processes. 439H. Xu et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 137 (2019) 433–441 3.5. Hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment promotes angiogenesis and re-epithelialization The second phase of wound healing is proliferative, while stem cells are induced to proliferation and differentiation to repair defect tissue. Angiogenesis and re-epithelialization are critical factors in this time. The histological results illustrated that the blood ﬂow of the hydrogel- hUCMSCs combined treatment were more than that of the hydrogel or hUCMSCs alone group and the control after 3, 7 and 14 days (Figs. 5 and 6). Simultaneously, epidermis-like cell arrangement ﬁrst appeared in the hUCMSCs group and the combined treatment group on 7th day (Fig. 5). Moreover, cells proliferation around the wound in the hUCMSCs group and the hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment group was more than the other two groups (Fig. 5). The interesting was that the formation of hair follicle around wound of the hydrogel-hUCMSCs com- bined treatment group was also more than other groups on 14th day (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the combined treatment of hydrogel and hUCMSCs could enhance microcirculation and re-epithelialization, con- tributing to wound closure, and induce hair follicle regeneration. Dex- tran hydrogel and MSCs was proved respectively to promote dermal regeneration with complete skin appendages [1,18]. These experimen- tal evidences identify with clinical evaluation for managing lower limb ischemia [15,44]. 3.6. Hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment increased collagen deposition It has been reported that hydrogel-MSCs combined treatment en- hance ﬁbroblast proliferation in dermis, at the same time, the prolifer- ated ﬁbroblast will start to secrete ECM of which the major ECM is collagen [45]. Collagen deposition plays a signiﬁcant role in the wound repair process, it can provide a suitable 3D microenvironment to sup- port cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation [46]. We found col- lagen mainly deposited around wound on 7th day while distributed the whole surface of wounds on 14th day after trauma in all rats, as shown in Fig. 7. The amounts of newly formed collagen in the hydrogel- hUCMSCs combined treatment group were more than the other three groups after 7th and 14th day, not 21st day what was probably collagen degradation age. These results showed the hydrogel-hUCMSCs com- bined treatment enhanced collagen deposition, which probably re- sulted in accelerating wound closure (Fig. 2B and C) and promoting tissue remodeling as follows. Promoting of collagen here corresponded to the recent research [31]. 3.7. Hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment promotes tissue remodeling In the remodeling stage, the exceed ECM will degrade until new formed ECM structure close to the normal tissue after wound healing [27]. As shown in Fig. 7, the Masson staining suggested that the collagen deposition of generated dermal tissue in the wounds of the rats in the hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment group became feeble on 21st day compared to dense state on 7th and 14th day, while the regenerating dermal tissue of other groups were still dense on 21st day, which suggested that on 21st day, tissue remodeling was com- pleted only in combined treatment group, not ﬁnished in other three groups. To conﬁrm that, epidermis maturation among the four groups was analyzed. Recently, researcher suggested hUCMSCs promote keratinocyte early-stage differentiation and proliferation [6]. K1, a marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation was detected. The ex- pression of K1 in the hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment was more than other groups on 21st day (Fig. 8). The result showed that hydrogel-hUCMSCs combined treatment accelerated the keratinocytes maturation and promoted epidermis and dermis remodeling after wound healing. In summary, this study synthesized the biocompatible thermo- sensitive hydrogel with improved biodegradation rate and mechanical characterization (Figs. 1 and 2A). After injected into wound, hydrogel- hUCMSCs combination inhibited inﬂammatory response (Figs. 3 and 4) and promoted angiogenesis and re-epithelialization (Figs. 5 and 6) contributing to acceleration the wound closure (Fig. 2B and C). These re- sults conﬁrmed the potential of CS/GP/CNC gels-hUCMSCs combination for wound healing, in keeping with previous reports which suggested the promise of Pluronic F-127, PEG or GelMA-HAMA hydrogel-ADSC combination [21,29]. Further, the ADSC cells seeded in the hydrogel en- hanced angiogenesis (CD31 marker) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) at the wound site [29]. The combined treatment was able to increase collagen deposition, TGF-β1 and bFGF secretion and tis- sue remodeling [17]. These researches involved molecular mechanism identiﬁed with our results. We also found collagen deposition gradually increased from the edge to the central of wound compared Masson staining of 7th, 14th and 21st day (Fig. 7). The pattern of hair growth was similar with this (Fig. 6). The expression of K1 also became in- creased on 7th day then decreased on 21st day (Fig. 8). These dynamic processes acceleration compared hydrogel-hUCMSCs combination to the others exactly implied effect of this combination for wound healing process. 4. Conclusions In conclusion, these results illuminated the positive effect of an in- jectable thermo-sensitive hydrogel loaded hUCMSCs for cutaneous wound healing. The combined treatment accelerated the wound closure and tissue remodeling and mature, as well as regeneration of skin ap- pendages. The combined efﬁciency suggested the novel hydrogel as ef- ﬁcient structural support assist hUCMSCs adhesion and survival in the wound, contributing to enhanced growth factors secretion and inhibited inﬂammation factors, resulting in accelerated cell migration and proliferation, microcirculation, the deposition of collagen. These re- sults supplied a novel alternative approach to treat cutaneous wound. However, the mechanisms of enhanced efﬁciency of combined treat- ment for cutaneous wound is not clear, the mechanotransduction and detailed signaling pathway need further studies to be clariﬁed.
