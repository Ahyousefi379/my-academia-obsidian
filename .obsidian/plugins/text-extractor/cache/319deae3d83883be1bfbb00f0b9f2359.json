Introduction With the increasing consumption of primary energy, the de- pletion of fossil fuel reserves, and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on environmental pollution, the efficient and opti- mal utilization of energy resources has become one of the hot focuses on sustainable energy applications [1]. The energy pro- duction, conversion, and storage mode vary depending on the product availability [2]. Fossil fuel consumption on the envi- ronment shows an adverse impact; researchers are devoted to inventing alternative energy technologies [3]. Sustainable tech- nology should contain the technical characteristics of restraining human environmental impact [4], creating possible sustainable development [5]. Renewable energy and innovative technology for the next generation aim to maintain the development of the earth [6]. Environmental problems should be alleviated to satisfy the energy consumption requirement and related services [7]. The fuel cell has been widely applied as an effective way to solve the current energy shortage problem, for instance, in sustainable power generation, energy storage [8], and carbon tax policy [9]. ∗ Corresponding author at: School of Electrical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, 530004, China. E-mail address: yinlinfei@gxu.edu.cn (L. Yin). The reaction process of fuel cells is without combustion. Hy- drogen as fuel participates in the electrochemical reaction of fuel cells. Hydrogen is a green energy source for fuel cells, and the chemical reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is low emission [10]. Therefore, the fuel cell for power generation is considered an ef- fective and feasible alternative scheme of primary energy, which can afford low emission, high conversion efficiency, and high fuel utilization [11]. Besides, fuel cell power generation has been considered the major energy source of distributed generation and microgrids [12]. Grid-connected solid oxide fuel cells (GSOFC) have been widely applied in power generation. Fuel (Hydrogen) is separated into hydrogen ions and electrons through GSOFC. Hydrogen ions reach the other end through the fuel cell mem- brane, and electrons reach the other end through the external circuit to form a current. Hydrogen protons combine with oxygen to produce water and release heat [10]. The load flexibility of GSOFC can adjust the power output to satisfy the power de- mand of power grids [13]. However, to extend the application and industrialization of GSOFCs in power generation and power dispatching, numerous difficulties occur in effectively controlling GSOFC systems. The fuel utilization is kept within the safe range (i.e., 70.0% to 90.0%), which can prolong the service life of GSOFC stacks and improve the operation efficiency and power quality of GSOFCs [14]. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110157 1568-4946/© 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. L. Yin and D. Liu Applied Soft Computing 137 (2023) 110157 Fig. 1. Simplified GSOFC operation. GSOFC generally consists of a cathode, an anode, and an elec- trolyte [15]. The fuel gas is delivered into the anode through the gas channel; the oxidant gas is delivered into the cathode through the gas channel [16]. The fuel and oxidant continuously react to generate electricity through bipolar gas channels on the sides of the electrolyte. Normally, hydrogen as fuel and oxygen anion participates in the reduction reaction to produce water vapor and electrons; oxygen as an oxidant reacts with electrons at the cath- ode to produce oxygen anion [17]. In industrial power generation operations, the load-tracking mode of GSOFC can be achieved by supplying proper hydrogen and air [18]. Meanwhile, the constant output voltage of GSOFCs can improve the power quality of distributed generation. The fuel utilization of GSOFCs remains in the stable operation range (i.e., 70.0% to 90.0%), and GSOFCs can obtain higher control performance and robustness [19]. There- fore, fuel utilization is a critical parameter of the GSOFC. The fuel utilization equals the ratio of the molar quantity of hydrogen gen- erated by the chemical reaction in GSOFCs to the molar quantity of hydrogen entering the GSOFCs [20]. The fuel utilization usually is required to maintain between 70.0% to 90.0%; high fuel uti- lization may lead to serious hydrogen deficiency of GSOFC, which may degrade the performance of GSOFC or permanently damaged electrode; a lower fuel utilization of the GSOFCs may lead to insufficient fuel utilization and cannot achieve high-efficiency power generation [21]. The simplified GSOFC operation is shown in Fig. 1. GSOFC has complex electrochemical properties after the active power load of the power grid changes in a wide range [22]. In normal operation, the hydrogen and air flow of the GSOFC are constrained. The model predictive control (MPC) is extremely suitable for solving multivariable coupling and constraint prob- lems of the GSOFCs [23]. The MPC can optimize control action through a finite control horizon [24]. Therefore, MPC can pro- vide a series of optimized control actions for GSOFCs. The MPC controller can track the set point of systems and implement the operational constraints. The MPC can involve the control performance and the cost function [25]. Nevertheless, the MPC can only optimize the local optimal control strategy online [26]. Moreover, the predicted accuracy of MPC might decrease. As commonly applied, other control meth- ods cannot be well applied to GSOFC. Specifically: (1) proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control cannot effectively control the GSOFC multiple-input multiple-output system; mul- tiple PID controllers are required to coordinate the control of the GSOFC system; (2) fuzzy control and sliding mode control (SMC) cannot achieve system power tracking when a perturba- tion occurs in the GSOFC system; (3) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm outputs in the learning process for a fixed discrete reward value, the RL algorithm needs to learn the system envi- ronment again when the power is perturbed to obtain a better optimization effect, which affects the real-time performance of the algorithm. In recent years, quantum computation techniques have been introduced into intelligent algorithms to improve the control effect [27]. For instance, quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) has been applied in medical image analysis [28]; the quantum genetic algorithm has been employed in digital communication, realizing the maximization of network benefit [29]; the quan- tum particle swarm optimization has a faster convergence effect in solving multi-objective optimization problems [30]. Quantum intelligence algorithm contains quantum computation and intel- ligent algorithm. Simulations showed that the quantum intelli- gent algorithm performs better in controlled performance [30]. Quantum parallel computation shows superior performance in model simulations; quantum computation can turn the quantum rotation angle to control the quantum revolving gate through systemic operations [31]. As a result, the quantum revolving gate can achieve more information on the optimal solution, im- proving the solution efficiency and effectively avoiding the local optimum [32]. The basic quantum revolving gate of quantum computation tunes the angle according to the systemic state; the system controlled by the quantum revolving gate can obtain robust performance [33]. Therefore, the strong calculation power of quantum computation is combined with the accusatively pre- dictive ability of the MPC in this study [34]. Inspired by the quantum revolving gate control, quantum computation is intro- duced into the MPC algorithm called quantum model predictive control (QMPC). A parallel artificial system is introduced into the QMPC to ex- tend the learning capability of the real-life system and reduce the control cost. Then, the quantum parallel model predictive control (QPMPC) is proposed for GSOFC. Therefore, the contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (1) The QPMPC for the GSOFC can save hydrogen combustion; then, the GSOFC could be widely applied in the power generation and dispatching of renewable power systems. In addition, the quantum parallel computation can pro- vide more predictive information for MPC. As a result, the QPMPC can better track the power demand and obtain higher predicted accuracy. (2) The QPMPC consists of quantum parallel computation and MPC. In addition, the QPMPC contains multiple choices of quantum computation and the online receding-horizon optimization of MPC. As a result, the QPMPC can solve multivariable coupling and multi-constraint problems of systems. (3) The QPMPC provides a virtual parallel platform; the real system and the virtual systems continuously exchange data, enabling the real system to obtain better controller parameters. The virtual parallel platform of the proposed QPMPC is similar to a digital twin system. 2 L. Yin and D. Liu Applied Soft Computing 137 (2023) 110157 Fig. 2. Framework of a GSOFC. (4) The QPMPC can compensate for the uncertainty caused by real-time inputs and obtain better dynamic control per- formance with lower hydrogen consumption than the PID, SMC, and fuzzy controller. After the comparison of simple and complex cases, the QPMPC achieves higher fuel uti- lization of hydrogen (82.0%) for GSOFC than MPC (80.0%), PID (80.0%), reinforcement learning (80.0%), fuzzy control (80.0%) and sliding mode control (79.7%). The remaining work of this study is distributed as follows. First, the GSOFC and the QPMPC controller are established in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. Then, the cases and conclusions are briefly listed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. 2. Plant models The analysis of GSOFCs consists of dynamic, material conserva- tion, thermal equilibrium, and electric energy transfer. The details of GSOFCs are presented in this subsection. The GSOFC dynamic model proposed is considered the control object. In the dynamic control process, the electrochemical, ther- modynamic, and fluid characteristics of the GSOFCs are consid- ered; a detailed mathematical model explanation of the GSOFCs is given. The thermodynamics of the GSOFCs contain the diffusion part, the material conservation, the thermal model, and the elec- trochemistry [35]. The framework (which contains a hydrogen tank, an air tank, a thermal model, the material conservation, the parts of voltage loss, the multilayer changing effect, and the open potential) of the GSOFCs is shown in Fig. 2. The Faraday law is applied in calculating the gas (hydro- gen, oxygen, steam) pressure of GSOFC [36]. The pressures of hydrogen, oxygen and steam are described as [37] ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ pH2,SOFC = pCinlet H2 + pCoutlet H2 2 pO2,SOFC = p Cinlet O2 + pCoutlet O2 2 pH2O,SOFC = pCinlet H2O + p Coutlet H2O 2 , (1) where pH2,SOFC means hydrogen pressures; pCinlet H2 and p Coutlet H2 mean inlet and outlet hydrogen pressures; pO2,SOFC, pCinlet O2 , and pCoutlet O2 are oxygen pressures; pH2O,SOFC, p Cinlet H2O , and pCoutlet H2O are steam pressures. The conservations of hydrogen, oxygen and steam in the air supply pipeline are described as [38] ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ MH2,in − MH2,out = iSOFC 2F MO2,in − MO2,out = iSOFC 4F MH2O,in − MH2O,out = − iSOFC 2F , (2) where MH2,in, MH2,out, MO2,in, MO2,out, MH2O,in, and MH2O,out mean hydrogen, oxygen, and steam flows; iSOFC is GSOFC current; F means Faraday coefficient. The converting process of GSOFC is [39] ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ M Coutlet anode = M Cinlet anode M Cinlet anode = MH2,in + MH2O,in M Coutlet cathode = M Cinlet cathode , (3) ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ MH2,in = Manode pCinlet H2 pCinlet anode , MH2,out = Manode p Coutlet H2 p Coutlet anode MH2O,in = Manode p Cinlet H2O p Cinlet anode , MH2O,out = Manode pCoutlet H2O p Coutlet anode MO2,in = Manode pCinlet O2 pCinlet cathode , MO2,out = Manode p Coutlet O2 pCoutlet cathode , (4) where M Cinlet anode and M Coutlet anode mean in and out anode gas mass, respectively; Manode, p Cinlet anode, and p Coutlet anode are anode gas pressures; pCinlet cathode and pCoutlet cathode are cathode gas pressures. The fuel utilization of hydrogen is defined as [40] η = iSOFC 2F /MH2,in, (5) where η means fuel utilization. The electrochemical reaction of GSOFCs can generate electric energy without combustion. Then, the electric energy is trans- ferred to the systemic power load. The annulus oxygen temperature of GSOFC is [41] ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎩ Toxygen,air supply pipeline = Toxygen,inlet + Toxygen,air supply pipeline,annulus 2 Toxygen,annulus = Toxygen,outlet + Toxygen,air supply pipeline,annulus 2 , (6) where Toxygen,air supply pipeline is the oxygen temperature in the air supply pipeline of GSOFC; Toxygen,inlet is the oxygen temperature of the air supply pipeline inlet of GSOFC; Toxygen,air supply pipeline,annulus, Toxygen,annulus, and Toxygen,outlet are oxygen temperatures. The potential of GSOFCs is [42] ESOFC = Estandard,SOFC −KE(TSOFC −273)+ R0TSOFC 4F ln[ (pH2 )2pO2 (pH2O)2 ], (7) 3 L. Yin and D. Liu Applied Soft Computing 137 (2023) 110157 where ESOFC is the potential generated by the chemical reaction of GSOFC; Estandard,SOFC is the reference potential of GSOFC; KE is the empirical constant; R0 is the gas constant, and F means the Fara- day constant, respectively; TSOFC is the cell working temperature of GSOFC; ln() means the logarithm of the base number e; pH2,SOFC is the pressure of hydrogen; pO2,SOFC is the pressure of oxygen; pH2O,SOFC is the pressure of steam. Eqs. (1) to (7) describe the current and combustion efficiency and the output voltage at the corresponding pressure, temperature, and flow rate [43]. Where the current of GSOFC is fed back to the QPMPC controller. Material conservation is an important part of the GSOFCs [44], as ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ Vanode R0TSOFC dpH2,SOFC dt = MH2,in − MH2,out − iSOFC 2F Vanode R0TSOFC dpH2O,SOFC dt = MH2O,in − MH2O,out + iSOFC 2F Vcathode R0TSOFC dpO2,SOFC dt = MO2,in − MO2,out − iSOFC 4F , (8) where Vanode is the anode channel volume; iSOFC is the current generated by the chemical reaction of the GSOFCs; Vcathode is the cathode channel volume. According to the voltage loss, the output voltage of the GSOFCs is [45] VSOFC = ESOFC − Vconcentration,SOFC − Vactivation,SOFC − Vohmic,SOFC, (9) where VSOFC means output voltage; Vconcentration,SOFC is voltage drop, which comprises multilayer charging effect and the activa- tion voltage drop influenced by the current on concentration volt- age drop; Vactivation,SOFC and Vohmic,SOFC are activation and ohmic voltages. The voltage drops of the GSOFCs are [45] ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ Vconcentration,SOFC = (iSOFC − CML dVconcentration,SOFC dt ) × (Ractivation,SOFC + Rconcentration,SOFC) Vactivation,SOFC = ζ0 + ζ1TSOFC Vohmic,SOFC = iSOFCRohmic,SOFC , (10) where CML is the equivalent capacitance of the multilayer charg- ing effect; Ractivation,SOFC and Rconcentration,SOFC are the equivalent activation and concentration resistances, respectively; ζ0 is the constant term of Vactivation,SOFC; ζ1 is the temperature coefficient of the GSOFCs; Vohmic,electrolyte and Vohmic,interconnection are the elec- trode voltage losses of electrodes and the multiple GSOFCs, re- spectively; Rohmic,SOFC is the total ohmic resistance of the GSOFCs. The GSOFC works by converting the chemical reaction between air and hydrogen to generate heat energy and then converting the heat energy to electrical energy. This work can control the output power of SOFC by adjusting the size of air and hydrogen flow rate as input to control the current level generated by the chemical reaction. High fuel utilization may lead to severe hydro- gen deficiency in the GSOFC, which may reduce the performance of the GSOFC or permanently damage the electrodes; low fuel utilization in the GSOFC may lead to insufficient fuel utilization for efficient power generation. Note that the model established in this work is a chemical reaction model of the SOFC system, which the conventional transfer function cannot describe. In the existing studies of GSOFC, the fuel utilization of GSOFC is generally low PID (80.0%), SMC (79.7%), RL (80.0%), MPC (80.0%), fuzzy control (80.0%). Consequently, the output of the state space of the GSOFC is [45] y(s) = G(s)[MH2 , Mair] T + δ(s), (11) where δ(s) is lumped uncertainty terms [46]; MH2 and Mair are the hydrogen flow and air flow of GSOFCs. 3. Quantum parallel model predictive control The proposed QPMPC consists of quantum computation, par- allel plant, and MPC. Besides, the parallel plant of the QPMPC contains one real-life proposed QMPC and three virtual parallel proposed QMPC controllers. The MPC-based action can achieve the minimum value of the cost function in the current state [47]. The first control action vector of the current state is applied as the next predicted input. The entire control process is applied in the next prediction of MPC [48]. The cost function contains the tracking error of power, control performance of the controller, and hydrogen fuel consumption [49]. The dynamic inputs of the GSOFC should be considered in the prediction of MPC [50]. The specific details of MPC are described as follows. The MPC obtains a current optimal strategy determined by online receding-horizon optimization for minimizing the deviation between the controlled variable and the next expected value [51]. 3.1. Quantum parallel computation Quantum computation is introduced to improve the control performance of intelligent methods, improve accuracy, and avoid the local optimization of intelligent methods in the iterative process [52]. The MPC obtains the local optimal control strat- egy online rather than the influence of real-time inputs more selectively. Therefore, quantum parallel computation is applied to improve the control performance of MPC. The QPMPC configures qubits probability amplitude as the next step state of QPMPC. The prediction process of MPC is expressed as the superposition of multiple states (Fig. 3), the updating parameters of QPMPC through the quantum revolving gate, and the achieving optimal solution by the online receding-horizon optimization [53]. Parallel quantum computation contains quantum computa- tion and parallel calculation. As a result, the quantum compu- tation gains more predicted information; the parallel calculation provides the optimal quantum rotation angle for the quantum computation. In quantum computation, the smallest unit of information is the qubit. A qubit contains state of states: |1⟩ or |0⟩, or super- position states between |1⟩ and |0⟩ [54], and the random state is |δ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, (12) where α and β are a pair of plurals; α is the probability ampli- tude of |0⟩; β is the probability amplitude of |1⟩; the following normalization conditions are satisfied [55]: |α| 2 + |β| 2 = 1, (13) where |α| 2 and |β|2 mean the probabilities of observed values of the quantum state are 0 and 1, respectively. The µ qubit is employed to represent simultaneously 2 µ states; any of the states is expressed as [56]: |δi⟩ = 2µ ∑ υ=1 ξ υ |υ⟩, (14) where ξ υ is the probability amplitude of the υ state; υ is the state of qubits. The α is the probability amplitude of |0⟩; β is the probability amplitude of |1⟩; apply the angle ε; the value range of phase of a qubit is ε ∈ [−π/2, π/2] [57]. The value of the phase of a qubit is calculated as ε = arctan(|β|/|α|), (15) where arctan() is the arctangent function. 4 L. Yin and D. Liu Applied Soft Computing 137 (2023) 110157 Fig. 3.

Box I. In this work, the quantum probability is applied in systemic updating. As a result, quantized intelligent algorithms obtain sur- prisingly accurate predictions. Moreover, the quantum calculation solves multi-constrained problems for GSOFC systems by trans- forming equational constraints into unconditionally constrained polar and unequal constrained problems into equatorially con- strained problems. 3.2. Quantum parallel model predictive control In this study, the quantum computation matrix is introduced into the predicted state of MPC. After the MPC is discretized by quantum parallel computation, the QPMPC can achieve a stable predictive output. A three-dimensional quantum revolving gate of quantum computation is introduced to the MPC [58]. The three- dimensional quantum revolving gate is described as [59] Eq. (16) given in Box I The quantum computation probability amplitude of the three-dimensional quantum revolving gate [60] is shown in Fig. 4. The proposed QPMPC contains one real-life proposed QMPC and three virtual parallel proposed QMPC controllers. Four pro- posed QMPC controllers share information by exchanging quan- tum rotation angles; three virtual parallel controllers provide the optimal quantum rotation angle for the controller. The framework of the proposed QPMPC is represented in Fig. 5. The optimization problem of the QPMPC is calculated as fol- lows: min JQPMPC = Nq∑ i=1 (∥yQPMPC(k+i)−yref∥2 Q +∥uQPMPC(k+i−1)−µref∥2 R), (17) 5 L. Yin and D.

Note that: yQPMPC(k + i) is set as yQPMPC(k + i) = [VSOFC(k + i) η(k + i)]T for the GSOFC system; that is to say, the optimization problem considers the fuel utilization; uQPMPC(k+i−1) = [MH2 (k+i−1), Mair(k+i−1)] T; MH2 (k+i−1) and Mair(k+i−1) mean the hydrogen flow and air flow of GSOFCs at k + i − 1, respectively; the optimization problem considers control cost (i.e., hydrogen consumption). The reference input of QPMPC µref is µref = (CQPMPC(I − AQPMPC)−1BQPMPC)−1, (18) where CQPMPC, AQPMPC, and BQPMPC are the parameters of the QPMPC; I = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠. Then, the reference output of QPMPC yref can be calculated by replacing µref of Eq. (17) with Eq. (18). The dimension of AQPMPC matrix must be 3 × 3. The parameters AQPMPC and CQPMPC of the QPMPC are up- dated by a three-dimensional quantum revolving gate GQPMPC. The updated QPMPC parameters are AQPMPC = AMPCGQPMPC, (19) CQPMPC = CMPCGQPMPC. (20) The output yQPMPC(k + i) of the QPMPC at k + i is calculated as yQPMPC(k + i) = CQPMPCxQPMPC(k + i), (21) where xQPMPC(k + i) is the current state of QPMPC. The state of the system is xQPMPC(k + 1) = AQPMPCxQPMPC(k) + BQPMPCuQPMPC(k), (22) where AQPMPC and BQPMPC are the systemic parameters, respec- tively; xQPMPC(k) is the systemic state at k; uQPMPC is the systemic input at k. The predicted state ˆxQPMPC(k + 1) of the QPMPC is ˆxQMPC(k + 1) = AQMPCGQMPC ˆxQMPC(k) + BQMPCuQMPC(k) + LQMPC(CQMPCGQMPC ˆxQMPC(k) − yQMPC(k)), (23) where ˆxQPMPC(k + 1) is the quantum predicted state of QPMPC; ˆxQPMPC(k) is the quantum state of QPMPC; uQPMPC(k) means the input of QPMPC at k; LQPMPC is the systemic parameter; yQPMPC(k) means the system output of the QPMPC at k. The next state ˆxQPMPC(k + 1) of the system can be predicted by the current state ˆxQPMPC(k) of the GSOFC system and the input uQPMPC(k) in the current state. Consequently, the QPMPC can real-time update the systemic state to satisfy the receding-horizon optimization process and obtain the optimal control strategy. The input constraints of the system are represented as follows: umin ≤ uQPMPC(k + i) ≤ umax, (24) where umin is the lower bound of input of systems; uQMPC(k + i) mean the input of systems at k + i; umax is the upper bound of input of systems. The output constraints of the system at k + i are represented as follows: ymin ≤ yQPMPC(k + i) ≤ ymax, (25) where ymin and ymax mean minimum and maximum systemic outputs, respectively. 3.3. Quantum parallel model predictive control for plant models With a non-minimization description, higher robustness, and stability, the QPMPC method applies the receding-horizon op- timization strategy to compensate for the uncertainty caused by real-time inputs. Furthermore, the dynamic performance of QPMPC is stable, i.e., the QPMPC can effectively solve multivari- able constrained problems. The QPMPC is applied to the control of the GSOFCs. The parameters of ˆxQPMPC(k + 1) is the quantum predictive state of the QPMPC for GSOFCs at k + 1; ˆxQPMPC(k) is the quantum predictive state of the QPMPC for GSOFCs at k; xQPMPC(k) = [VSOFC(k) η(k) ISOFC(k)]T; ISOFC(k) is the output current of the GSOFCs at k; ISOFC(k), which is applied to control the output power usually, is introduced into the state vector for high fuel utilization in this work. The uQPMPC(k) means predicted and controlled input by the QPMPC of the GSOFCs at k; uQPMPC(k + i − 1) = [MH2 (k + i − 1), Mair(k + i − 1)] T; MH2 (k + i − 1) and Mair(k + i − 1) mean the hydrogen flow and air flow of GSOFCs at k + i − 1, respectively; µref mean reference input corresponding to the reference output of the GSOFCs; umin is the lower bound of input of the GSOFCs; umax is the upper bound of input of the GSOFCs.

The constraint of fuel utilization of GSOFCs [61] is calculated as ηmin = iref 2F × ηupper , (26) where ηmin and ηupper are fuel utilization bounds, are 70.0– 90.0% [62]; iref is the reference output current of GSOFCs. The control structure of QPMPC for GSOFCs is shown in Fig. 6. First, set the systemic power demand, calculate the reference voltage, and receive the reference trajectory for QPMPC optimiza- tion. Then, MPC performs receding-horizon optimization based on the obtained reference trajectory; quantum computing serves to accelerate the receding-horizon optimization of MPC; parallel MPC can acquire the optimal QPMPC control parameters online. 6 L.

QPMPC predicts the optimal amount of hydrogen and oxygen for the GSOFC system at the next moment based on the reference trajectory; the GSOFC system generates chemical energy through chemical reactions and converts it to electric energy; the GSOFC system outputs voltage and current; GSOFC feeds the current back to QPMPC controller for predicting the output of GSOFC system in the next step. The current generated by the GSOFC system is inverted by the voltage inverter and boosted to the grid voltage level through the transformer to realize the grid connection of the GSOFC system. The power demand is the input of the QPMPC. With the feedback reference trajectory of MPC at the next step, stable output voltage and higher fuel utilization are obtained [63]. 4.

The GSOFCs stack consists of 192 cascaded GSOFCs. The sys- temic parameters of the GSOFCs described in Section 2 are given in Appendix A.1 [45,64]. The control structure of the six control algorithms is shown in Fig. 7. Since the PID controller is the architecture of single-input single-output, one PID controls hydrogen flow; another PID con- trols the output power by generating a reference current for the voltage source inverter. The QPMPC, MPC, and RL are applied to solve the problems of multi-input multi-output of the GSOFCs. Through the reference power demand and the fuel utilization of the GSOFCs, the QPMPC, MPC, RL, SMC, and fuzzy controller are employed to control the air flow and hydrogen flow of GSOFCs for the optimal power output and higher fuel utilization. The parameters of compared methods are given in Appendix A.2. The parameters of the QPMPC are set as follows: Q = ( 0.5 0 0 10 ) , R = (100 0 0 100 ) , CQPMPC = (7.128 1.098 0 0 0 16 ) , AQPMPC = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ −0.0834 0 0 −0.08753 −0.08753 0 0 0.0001 −0.09847 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ , BQPMPC = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 4 0 0 1 −23.63 9.619 × 10 −8 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ , and LQPMPC = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ −0.0329 0 −0.0095 0 0 −0.0058 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ , γQPMPC = 8.0532 × 10 −4, ϕQPMPC = 5.3078 × 10 −4 , HQPMPC = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 27.1738 0 −10.1198 6.6648 −150.2998 0.0016 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ , GQPMPC = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ 0.4347 0 −0.0002 −0.3724 0.4169 0.0001 −0.0001 0.0002 0.3736 ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ , umin = (1e−4 1e−4 ) , 7 L.

These parameters of all compared methods are optimized by particle swarm optimization with 500 particles and 500 iterations. Compared with other control methods, the quantum compu- tation in QPMPC can accelerate the parameter optimization and achieve the optimal control parameters of QPMPC in multiple parallel QMPCs. 4.1. Simple case (Case I) The power demand of this case, which contains several drastic changes, is shown in Fig. 8, as Pdemand = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ 3500 0 < ts ≤ 400 3000 400 < ts ≤ 500 20ts − 700 500 < ts ≤ 550 4000 550 < ts ≤ 700 −5ts + 7500 700 < ts ≤ 720 3900 720 < ts ≤ 900 5400 900 < ts ≤ 1000 5200 ts > 1000 , (27) where ts is the configured running time. Temperature is another critical parameter of GSOFC that needs to be controlled. In this study, ten simulations of temperature are compared. In temperature test simulations, the integral absolute error (IAE), integral square error (ISE), average voltage loss, and integral time absolute error (ITAE) of the power are compared for the performance testing of QPMPC (see Table 1). Fig. 8. The power demand of Case I. Compared with the temperature for the GSOFC, the simula- tion results show that the GSOFC working in 1151 K can obtain higher power tracking ability. The GSOFC has the lowest average voltage loss when working in 1251 K. However, to realize the low cost of GSOFC, the operating temperature must be reduced [65]. Therefore, the working temperature of GSOFC is set at 1151 K. The power tracking performance of different controllers is shown as follows. The influences of QPMPC, PID, SMC, fuzzy controller, MPC, and RL on the output power of the GSOFCs are compared. The obtained output power curves are shown in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9, the QPMPC shows an excellent tracking performance of the power demand than the MPC, PID, and RL. On the other hand, the SMC and the fuzzy controller cannot track the power demand with the power demand changes. 8 L. Yin and D. Liu Applied Soft Computing 137 (2023) 110157 Fig. 9. The output power of GSOFCs in Case I. Fig. 10. Fuel utilization of GSOFCs in Case I. Figs. 15 and 16 present the hydrogen and air flow in Case I, respectively. The fuel utilization of SMC is 79.7% (Fig. 10). Thus, the pro- posed QPMPC effectively improves the fuel utilization of the GSOFCs. Besides, the QPMPC obtains higher power tracking per- formance than MPC, RL, and PID; the SMC and the fuzzy controller cannot achieve power tracking. Therefore, the controller cannot change the input according to the power demand change when the power demand changes. Therefore, the GSOFCs with QPMPC controllers have higher fuel utilization (Fig. 10) and stable control performance with different control signals (Fig. 11). The output voltage and current of six algorithms of GSOFCs in Case I are given as Figs. 12 and 13 under different inputs (Fig. 14). The controllers (i.e., QPMPC, MPC, and RL) for the GSOFC can ensure the constraint of the GSOFC system. The QPMPC obtains better tracking performance and higher hydrogen fuel utilization than other methods (Tables 2 and 3). Besides, the QPMPC achieves lesser hydrogen consumption in Case I than the MPC, RL, and Fig. 11. Control curves in Case I: (a) QPMPC; (b) MPC; (c) RL; (d) PID; (e) SMC; (f) fuzzy control. PID (Table 3). QPMPC optimizes the GSOFC system parameters by incorporating quantum gates. As a result, QPMPC enables an effective improvement in the fuel utilization of the GSOFC system within the safe operating range (82.0%). 9 L. Yin and D.

Complex case (Case II) To verify the flexibility and effectiveness of the QPMPC algo- rithms in complex cases. The complex power demand is Pdemand = ⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩ 3400 0 < ts ≤ 200 4000 + 1000 sin( π 600 ts) +100rand(T ) ts > 200 , (28) where rand(T ) is a random value of [0, 1] for 30 s. The power demand of complex case, which is sine waveform with perturbation, is shown in Fig. 17; GSOFC power in Fig. 18; fuel utilization in Fig. 19; controller outputs in Fig. 20; GSOFC voltage and current in Figs. 21 and 22; controller inputs in Fig. 23; hydrogen and air flow in Figs. 24 and 25, respectively; control indices are in Table 4. The QPMPC obtains better tracking performance, higher fuel utilization of hydrogen, and lesser hydrogen consumption in com- plex Case II (Table 4). After introducing quantum computation, the QPMPC shows higher control performance with higher fuel utilization; the hy- drogen consumption of the QPMPC is lesser than that of the MPC, RL, and PID; the QPMPC improves the fuel utilization of the GSOFCs (Figs. 18 to 25, and Table 4). The QPMPC controlled by a two-dimensional quantum revolv- ing gate G2 is designed as G2 = [ cos γ − sin γ sin γ cos γ ] . (29) To ensure that the original structure would not change after the introduction of quantum computation, the parameters of the QPMPC controlled by the two-dimensional quantum revolving gate are L and B. 10 L. Yin and D. Liu Applied Soft Computing 137 (2023) 110157 Fig. 12. Output voltages in Case I. Fig. 13. Output currents in Case I. The updated QPMPC parameters are expressed as follows: L = LG2, (30) B = BG2. (31) After numerous testing: (i) the QPMPC controlled by the three- dimensional quantum revolving gate shows higher control per- formance than the QPMPC controlled by the two-dimensional quantum revolving gate (Table 3); (ii) the proposed QPMPC based on the three-dimensional quantum revolving gate obtains higher performance than the three-dimensional quantum revolving gate with other parameters (Table 3). Compared with the real-time regulation of MPC, the QPMPC can change the quantum rotation angle by controlling the quantum revolving gate in real-time, can reduce the impact of real-time dynamic inputs, and the system can achieve a stable state fast. The control performances of the MPC and the QPMPC are compared in Fig. 26 (see Table 5). Although the optimized PID, MPC, RL, SMC, and fuzzy control controllers all exhibit the same values of fuel utilization in the Fig. 14. Inputs in Case I: (a) QPMPC; (b) MPC; (c) RL; (d) PID; (e) SMC; (f) fuzzy control. GSOFC system, the QPMPC has better power tracking perfor- mance, as shown in Fig. 9 and Table 2. As in Fig. 15, the controlled fuel inputs of these controllers are different during the control of the GSOFC. Tables 3 and 4 show that QPMPC saves fuel costs in a long operation. 11 L. Yin and D.

Fig. 19. Fuel utilization in Case II. The limitations of the QPMPC include: (i) the QPMPC is con- trolled by the quantum revolving gate, the quantum rotation angle γQMPC, and ϕQMPC with strong randomness; in quantum computation, the QPMPC is controlled by turning the quantum rotation angle; the quantum probability amplitude is utilized to control the output of the next state of systems; the value of the quantum rotation angle γQMPC and ϕQMPC should be maintained in (0, 0.1]; (ii) the MPC can only optimize the optimal local solution online; (iii) the fuel utilization of two-dimensional-based QMPC is 80%, which is equal to the fuel utilization of the MPC, RL, PID and fuzzy controller; i.e., the fuel utilization of two-dimensional- based QMPC should be improved; (iv) four-dimensional-based QMPC has not yet been designed; (v) the computation time of this QPMPC is longer than that of the MPC; the computation memory of this QPMPC is larger than that of the MPC. 12 L.

Conclusions The study combines quantum parallel computation and MPC as QPMPC, which obtains better control performances than the QMPC, MPC, RL, SMC, fuzzy control, and PID under complex cases. The QPMPC has the following traits. Fig. 21. GSOFCs voltage in Case II. Fig. 22. GSOFCs current in Case II. (1) The QPMPC consists of quantum computation and the MPC. The QPMPC obtains the optimal control strategy by online receding-horizon optimization. The quantum computation of the QPMPC automatically adjusts according to the sys- temic operation of GSOFCs. A quantum revolving gate is introduced into the predicted part of the MPC. (2) The QPMPC obtains higher fuel utilization (82.0%) than the MPC (80.0%), RL (80.0%), PID (80.0%), fuzzy controller (80.0%), and SMC (79.7%) for the GSOFC. The QPMPC, RL, and MPC can track the power demand of the GSOFC. The QPMPC obtains a more stable output with less control cost than the MPC. (3) The QPMPC provides an optimal dynamic control method with online receding-horizon optimization for complex systems. The quantum control of complex systems is re- alized by controlling the quantum rotation angle online. The coming tasks cover that: (i) GSOFCs could be designed for renewable energy generation; (ii) the adjustable quantum revolv- ing gate could adjust the quantum rotation angle for intelligent algorithm by the optimal quantum revolving gate in real-time. 13 L.
