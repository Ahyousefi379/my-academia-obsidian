Introduction Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by a photosensitizer (PS) under illu- mination of light with a certain wavelength to cause cancer cell toxicity, has been widely used in clinic as a non-invasive onco- logic therapeutic modality. [ 1 ] Compared with traditional cancer therapy modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemo- therapy, the major advantage of PDT is its intrinsic safety with non-invasion. [ 2 ] There are three primary components in PDT: excitation light, photosensitizers (PSs) and oxygen mol- ecules. [ 3 ] Upon the irradiation of light with certain wavelength, PSs can be excited and then react with nearby biomolecules in the cellular microenvironment through electron transfer to generate radical and radical anion species (type I) or directly transfer its energy to nearby triplet oxygen to produce singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) (type II). [ 4 ] It is generally accepted that these two competing pathways can occur simultaneously and 1 O 2 gener- ated from a type II reaction is the principal cytotoxic compo- nent for the PDT biological effect. [ 5 ] 1 O 2 is a highly reactive species that is able to induce signiﬁ cant damage to cells via apoptotic, necrotic, and autophagy-associated pathways. [ 6 ] One advantage of PDT is its minimum side effects. Without illumination with suitable light, PSs cannot be activated and no toxicity component can be generated. Therefore, PSs in a dark environment display no toxicity to cells and tissues. [ 7 ] In addition, with the great developments of photonic technolo- gies and materials science, excitation laser sources with ade- quate power for effective PDT activation can easily be tuned to safe threshold values. [ 8 ] Another advantage of PDT is high selectivity. [ 1d , 9 ] When administered intravenously, PSs dis- tribute throughout the body, including at tumors and healthy organs without considering active or passive targeting delivery. Selective tumor therapeutic effects can be achieved simply by focusing the light illumination on the malignant lesion region. [ 10 ] Upon laser excitation, PDT processes can thus only be initiated in the tumor tissue with plenty of 1 O 2 generation to eradicate the cancer cell. Meanwhile in other organs, no damage is caused even at high PS concentrations because of the absence of excitation light. This selectivity endows PDT with minimal adverse impact on normal tissues, which is still a great challenge for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. [ 2,11 ] However, the application of PDT in clinic is restricted to peripheral and endoscope accessible regions (such as skin, neck, and oral cavity cancers), [ 6a , 14 ] because PDT of deep tumors is largely hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of excitation light. [ 15 ] Numerous studies have proved that the limited penetration depth results from the scattering and absorption of photons by tissue, which is also wavelength- dependent. [ 12,13,16 ] Because of the strong absorbance of pro- teins and nucleic acids, photons with short wavelength (such as UV light) can only be delivered to superﬁ cial regions. With the red shift of light wavelength, the absorption of proteins and nucleic acids attenuates signiﬁ cantly while hemoglobin and melanin turn into the main absorbers for the excitation light with wavelengths less than 650 nm, as shown in Figure 1 a. Beyond 650 nm, the total extinction coefﬁ cient of tissue com- ponents is maintained at a low level, but it increases rapidly with wavelengths longer than 900 nm, which is attributed to scattering and absorption of water molecules. Therefore, the optimal tissue penetration depth is achieved with irra- diation light wavelengths in the range of 650–900 nm, called the “optical window” or “NIR window”. Importantly, the tissue penetration depth of light in the NIR window is about an order of magnitude greater than that of light excited by UV-VIS, as displayed in Figure 1 b. However, most clinically used PSs possess quite a low absorption in the NIR window, resulting in inefﬁ cient PDT under NIR excitation. [ 13 ] For example, the absorbance of Photofrin at 650 nm is less than 10% of that at the Soret band (400 nm), [ 17 ] and the amount of 1 O 2 generated under a 516 nm excitation is only one-eighth of that excited at 400 nm light. [ 18 ] Consequently, novel PS derivatives with a large absorbance in the NIR window have been pursued and applied to ﬁ ght against deep malignant tis- sues. [ 19 ] Shen and colleagues reported the synthesis of a modi- ﬁ ed BODIPY dye with strong absorption between 680 nm and 750 nm. MTT assays and ﬂ ow cytometric analysis further proved the NIR light induced PDT effects on HeLa cells. [ 20 ] However in addition to the troublesome synthetic proce- dure, the 1 O 2 quantum yields of many of these novel NIR- absorbing PSs are usually low, especially compared to those of conventional PSs excited in the UV-VIS range. Recently, nanoparticles with a large extinction coefﬁ - cient in the NIR window such as upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), [ 21 ] quantum dots (QDs), [ 22 ] carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) [ 22b , 23 ] and gold nanomaterials (GNMs) [ 8,24 ] have become promising candidates in the ﬁ eld of deep tumor PDT. [ 25 ] These multifunctional nanoparticles have intense absorption in the NIR region and can be used as NIR light acceptors. After harvesting NIR photons, they emit strong UV-VIS photons that are able to excite PSs nearby via an energy transfer process. Here, the NIR-absorbing nanoparti- cles are named as antenna nanoparticles. With the association of these antenna nanoparticles, it is feasible for the clinically approved PSs to be used for deep-seated tumor treatment by NIR light activation. However, the tissue penetration depth of NIR light is still limited to no more than 1.5 cm, [ 26 ] even small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 reviews www.MaterialsViews.com 5862 www.small-journal.com © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim though many exciting results have been demonstrated on small animal models. [ 19b , 27 ] Alongside NIR light, X-ray may be another promising source for deep PDT activation to overcome the limitation of penetration depth, because of the almost limitless penetra- tion ability and wide clinical tumor theranostic applications of X-ray. [ 28 ] Similarly to NIR-absorbing nanoparticles, scin- tillating nanoparticles (ScNPs) have a high X-ray shielding capacity and are able to convert X-ray into UV-VIS ﬂ uores- cence. [ 29 ] Through ﬂ uorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between ScNPs and surface-attached PSs, ScNP-PS nanocomposites can achieve “real” deep PDT. Considering the merits of robust penetrability of X-rays, it is possible to apply such a strategy to clinical applications. Interestingly, use of X-ray as a PDT light source makes it feasible to inte- grate diagnosis, radiotherapy and PDT for tumor theranostic applications. Such a novel approach may not only improve the tumor treatment efﬁ cacy but also reduce the radiation dose and side effects in radiotherapy. [ 30 ] Nanoparticles employed in PDT function more than antennae, they also play the role of carriers to improve the active and passive targeting ability of PSs. Owing to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, PS- loaded nanoparticles tend to circulate for a long time and accumulate in tumor tissue with a higher concentration than that in normal tissues. [ 31 ] Moreover, the functional groups on the surface of nanoparticles can conjugate with various tar- geting ligands, which can speciﬁ cally recognize different bio- markers such as cell surface-expressed receptors to enhance the uptake of PS-packed nanoparticles. [ 32 ] Both of these effects can help to improve the therapeutic efﬁ cacy. Herein, the latest advancement of novel strategies for deep tissue PDT based on diverse nanoparticles is reviewed. Based on the excitation energy source, these deep tissue PDT strategies are classiﬁ ed into three groups: i) NIR light excited PDT based on functional nanomaterials such as UCNPs, QDs, CNMs and GNMs which can be used as antennae to accept the energy of external light or act as novel photosensitizers responsible for 1 O 2 generation and tumor cell damage in deep tumor treatment directly; ii) X-ray excited PDT based on scintillating nanoparticles or afterglow nanoparticles which possess unique ﬂ uorescent properties under the illumination of low-energy ionizing radiation and can overcome the limita- tion of tissue penetration depth; iii) internal light excited PDT, which makes full use of the chemical and biological reactions occurring in vivo to excite the co-delivered PSs without the use of an external light source. Upon proper integration with PSs, nanoparticles employed in these processes may serve as energy transducers, a carrier matrix or PSs directly. Addition- ally, PS loading approaches, energy transfer processes, 1 O 2 generation and biological applications of these novel PDT strategies are discussed in detail in this paper. 2. Integration of PSs and Antenna Nanoparticles Functional nanomaterials have shown their unique applica- tions in molecular imaging, [ 33 ] tumor cell identiﬁ cation, [ 34 ] Zhen Cheng is an Associate Professor of Radiology and a member of the Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford University (MIPS), BioX program, Canary Center at Stanford for Cancer Early Detection and Stanford Cancer Center.

His research is focused on the fabrication and biomedical applications of multifunctional nanomaterials (including quantum dots, magnetic nanopar- ticles, and scintillating nanoparticles) in the ﬁ eld of tumor diagnosis and therapy. tumor diagnosis [ 31a , 32a , 35 ] as well as tumor-targeted drug delivery and therapy. [ 36 ] Use of functional nanoparticles makes it feasible to apply diverse clinically approved PSs with maximum absorption at the UV-VIS region for deep- seated tumor treatment. On one hand, these functional nano- particles act as carrier matrices for PSs to enhance their long circulation capability and active/passive targeting. On the other hand, they are used as antennae to capture photons of illumination light with good penetrability and then emit light to excite the PSs nearby via efﬁ cient energy or electron transfer process. To strive for the best therapeutic response, the energy transfer efﬁ ciency between antenna nanoparti- cles and PSs must be optimized, which is highly dependent on the PSs loading approach. It is generally known that there are three major approaches for the combination of PSs and antenna nanoparticles: co-location, [ 30b ] physical loading [ 22a , 37 ] and covalent conjugation. [ 22b , 37b , 38 ] small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 www.MaterialsViews.com 5863© 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com 2.1. Co-Location of PSs and Antenna Nanoparticles The development of revolutionary strategies for deep PDT based on nanoparticle-photosensitizer (NP-PS) composites is still in its infant stage. Consequently, in terms of proof of principle investigations through much of the reported lit- erature, the activation of PSs by corresponding antenna nanoparticles can be simply achieved by co-locating them in cells or tissues because of facile manipulation process and predictable results. [ 30b , 39 ] For instance, after incubation with GdO 2 S:Tb particles and Photo II, human glioblastoma cells were exposed to diagnostic X-rays to study X-ray-induced photodynamic cell damage. In cells, GdO 2 S:Tb scintillation particles and PSs were co-located in mitochondria. Under X-ray irradiation, GdO 2 S:Tb particles were excited and emit visible ﬂ uorescence which was able to activate Photo II for efﬁ cient PDT. As a result, severe suppression (>90% rela- tive to controls) of cell viability was observed. [ 30b ] As X-ray is the energy source to initiate PDT, the penetration pathway of this modality may be limitless. However, some evident defects still exist in co-location strategy. On one hand, energy transfer efﬁ ciency between nanoparticles and PSs may be low due to the random combination and uncontrollable distance. On the other hand, the behavior of large-sized particles and small molecules of PS are quite different both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, further applications of this strategy are largely hindered and other loading approaches are being developed. 2.2. Physical Loading of PSs to Antenna Nanoparticles Physical loading is a popular method to integrate PSs and antenna nanoparticles due to the facile operation process. Because of the unique structure of different types of func- tional nanoparticles, PSs can be physically loaded by pore embedding, [ 24c , 40 ] electrostatic adherence [ 22a , 41 ] or hydro- phobic interaction. [ 21b , 42 ] Porous silica nanoparticles are widely employed as nanocarriers for drug delivery because of their intrinsic porous structure and outstanding biocompatibility. [ 43 ] These characteristics are beneﬁ cial for PS loading as well. Recent efforts on silica nanoparticles for PDT have opened prom- ising avenues to treat deep lesions. [ 44 ] For example, after coating with an outer layer of silica shell, gold nanorods (GNRs) were successfully utilized to encapsulate methylene blue for NIR excited PDT. Under NIR excitation, PSs packed in the pores of a silica matrix were efﬁ ciently activated through plasmonic electron transfer from the GNRs. After co-incubation with CT-26 cancer cells, MB-GNR@SiO 2 nano- composites showed enhanced 1 O 2 production compared to the control groups ( Figure 2 ). [ 24c ] Couleaud’s group reviewed the applications of silica nanoparticle-based PDT in detail. [ 45 ] Electrostatic adherence is another commonly used PS loading approach realized through the interaction between opposing charged components, such as charged nanopar- ticles and ionized PSs. [ 46 ] In a recent study, efﬁ cient two- photon absorption (TPA)-PDT was carried out with this method ( Figure 3 ). [ 23a ] TMPyP, a tetra-cationic porphyrin, was attached on the surface of negative charged carbon dots (CDs) by electrostatic interaction. As the emission spec- trum of CDs overlapped well with the absorption of TMPyP, a highly efﬁ cient (45%) energy transfer from CDs to PSs through a FRET pathway was achieved. It is important to note that the two-photon absorption cross section (TPACS) of CDs is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of TMPyP molecules in the NIR window. Therefore, the intelligently designed CD-PS nanocomposites could induce enhanced 1 O 2 production under 700 nm femto-second laser irradiation. Moreover, TPA-PDT on HeLa cells was success- fully achieved by an unfocused laser beam with low power density (160 mW mm −2 ), due to the large TPACS of CDs and high FRET efﬁ ciency. In another representative study, TMPyP4, a cation PS derived from porphyrin, was delivered by UCNPs platform modiﬁ ed with G-quadruplexes. [ 41b ] The cationic PSs bind to anionic phosphate groups on G-quadru- plexes through π–π interactions and electrostatic adherence. In this way, efﬁ cient energy transfer from UCNP cores to PSs on the surface was observed and PDT effects on CEM cells were proved with 980 nm excitation (0.5 W cm −2 for 10 min).

KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com adherence approach have shown excellent performance in vitro, however, they face great challenges in stability for in vivo applications because of the complex physiological environment. It is generally known that most of the currently used PSs are intrinsically hydrophobic in their chemical proper- ties, leading to instability in physiological conditions. For the purpose of biomedical applications of these PSs, further modiﬁ cations are essential. Besides tedious procedures, the modiﬁ cation process may result in an unexpected decrease of the quantum yield of 1 O 2 . With the aim of avoiding the inconvenient modiﬁ cation process, great efforts have been devoted to load PSs with functional nanoparticles by hydro- phobic interaction. [ 47 ] This strategy is regarded as an efﬁ cient way to enable these hydrophobic PSs to be effectively used in biological media. Usually, high-quality antenna nanopar- ticles are prepared in oil solvents with hydrophobic alkane molecule (such as oleic acid or trioctylphosphine oxide) coatings. After modiﬁ cation with amphiphilic molecules, the hydrophobic portion of the modiﬁ er interacts strongly with the particle surface-capped alkane chain for a high tendency of water solubility. A hydrophobic layer is formed beneath the hydrophilic surface on top of the inorganic nanopar- ticle, which can be used for drug loading via a hydrophobic interaction. Zhao’s group has implemented several cases with this modality on UCNPs. [ 48 ] UCNPs were synthesized through thermal decomposition with oleic acid coating. After modiﬁ cation with Tween-20, they were employed to pack hypocrellin, a hydrophobic PS ( Figure 4 ). In this strategy, PSs can be protected from damage by the surrounding sol- vent. Beyond that, an appropriate distance between antenna UCNPs and hypocrellin can be ensured, which would pro- mote high-energy transfer efﬁ ciency. Under irradiation of a 980 nm laser (0.8 W cm −2 for 5 min), much 1 O 2 was generated and efﬁ cient PDT was achieved on several types of cancer cells. Apart from amphiphilic polymer molecules, protein acts as another kind of modiﬁ er with better biocompat- ibility. Albumin, the majority component of serum proteins, has been widely used as a safe nanocarrier for drug delivery. More importantly, paclitaxel-loaded human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles, generally named as Abraxane, have been approved for clinical cancer treatment. [ 49 ] Therefore, the loading of drugs with relatively low water solubility by albumin is an attractive approach. After decorating UCNPs with bovine serum albumin (BSA), Rose Bengal (RB) and IR 825 were efﬁ ciently co-loaded in the hydrophobic domain of the protein. [ 42d ] Due to the good spectrum overlap and close space, efﬁ cient energy transfer from UCNPs to RB was clearly observed. In combination with the thermal effect from IR825, signiﬁ cant tumor inhibition was achieved in vivo by simultaneous PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) under NIR excitation. One thing to notice is that the strategies based on phys- ical loading have been widely used for delivery and con- trolled release of chemotherapeutic drugs as well. Thereby, it leaves no doubt that PSs loaded by these strategies can leak out during circulation in vivo, which results in a dramatic decrease of the therapeutic efﬁ cacy of antenna nanoparticle- PS-based PDT. 2.3. Covalent Conjugation of PSs to Antenna Nanoparticles Because of the multitude of enzymes and other biological ingredients, the physiological microenvironment in vivo is much more complicated than that in vitro. Consequently, nanocomposites fabricated with co-location or physical loading approaches usually cannot attain stability for in vivo applications any more. To ﬁ ght against this shortcoming, covalent conjugation strategy has been proposed to obtain small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 4.

KGaA, Weinheim a stable and effective energy transfer system between PSs and antenna nanoparticles. Moreover, covalent conjugation approach has higher selectivity and controllability than other loading approaches. The covalent conjugation strategy is based on the chem- ical reaction between antenna nanoparticles and PS moie- ties. [ 50 ] Speciﬁ cally, only PSs with active functional groups such as a carboxyl group, amino group, or sulfhydryl group can be linked onto antenna nanoparticle surfaces under certain conditions. In a study, a comparison of FRET-based PDT systems established via covalent conjugation and elec- trostatic interaction was performed, where positive charged amino-terminal UCNPs were employed as donors and RB as an energy acceptor. [ 51 ] Although FRET was observed in both cases at the beginning, the ﬁ nal RB concentration in the elec- trostatic interaction group was one order of magnitude less than that in the covalent conjugation group after abundant washing. The results indicate that the covalent conjugation approach is much more stable and effective. Zhang and col- leagues covalently attached two types of PSs namely RB and Ce6 on the surface of peptide-modiﬁ ed CdSe QDs with green and red ﬂ uorescence emission respectively. [ 52 ] By adjusting the stoichiometry of the donor and the acceptor, the number of PS molecules on each nanoparticle could be easily modi- ﬁ ed in the range of 1–30. This study further demonstrated the high controllability of the covalent conjugation approach. In addition, an innovative deep PDT modality activated by X-ray was investigated by conjugation of carboxylated por- phyrin molecules on the surface of amine-functionalized Tb 2 O 3 nanoscintillators via a carbodiimide-mediated reac- tion ( Figure 5 ). By carefully monitoring the reaction parame- ters, ≈13 porphyrin molecules were anchored around a single Tb 2 O 3 ScNP that was enough to initiate a PDT effect in vitro as conﬁ rmed. Finally, signiﬁ cant 1 O 2 generation under X-ray irradiation was veriﬁ ed by using two commercial probes, SOSG and APF. These results further implied high stability and efﬁ cacy of covalent conjugation. [ 53 ] 3. NIR Excited Deep PDT Although NIR seems to be a valid irradiation source to trigger PDT in deep-seated tumor tissue, most clinically approved PSs show low absorption in the transparent tissue window. For example, the absorbance of Photoferrin at 650 nm is less than 10% of that at the Soret band (400 nm). [ 17 ] Clinical demands for deep-seated tumor PDT has driven the development of novel photosensitive materials and new PDT strategies. [ 54 ] 3.1. Deep PDT Based on Direct NIR Absorption Although NIR light possesses high tissue penetration ability, PSs that can be directly excited with NIR light are rare. This has resulted in large efforts for improving the photophysical character of PSs for efﬁ cient PDT upon NIR irradiation. [ 55 ] Cyanine dyes including Cypate, Indocyanine green (ICG) and some other derivatives are such NIR-absorbing organic molecules with clinical potential for theranostic applica- tions because of promising multiple functionalities such as NIR ﬂ uorescence imaging, NIR-induced thermal effect, and 1 O 2 generation. [ 56 ] However, cyanine dyes used in vivo tend to undergo opsonization by proteins, which results in poor physiological stability and short plasma half-time. With the assistance of nanocarriers, these shortcomings can be over- come. Moreover, the target speciﬁ city of the drugs can be improved. In our previous work, Cypate and Ce6 co-loaded micelles were fabricated with relatively high drug loading capacity for imaging-guided photothermal/photodynamic small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 5.

[ 19b ] After loading, the stability and photo bleaching resistance of these two NIR-absorbing dyes were enhanced and the cellular uptake and tumor accu- mulation were increased as well. It is notable to point out that Cypate is mainly used as a photothermal agent in this work. More importantly, the small fraction of 1 O 2 gener- ated by Cypate under 785-nm laser irradiation plays a very important role in the disruption of lysosomal membranes. As reported before, endo-lysosomal compartments are not highly susceptible to oxidative ROS damage, therefore the disruption of endo-lysosomal membranes would enhance endo-lysosomal escape and facilitate the cytoplasmic distri- bution of PSs to maximize their photodynamic activity. With the guidance of dual photoacoustic and NIR ﬂ uorescence imaging, precise synergistic PDT and PTT were conducted on mice bearing 4T1 tumors via intravenous injection of Cypate/Ce6-loaded micelles. Complete inhibition of tumor growth was achieved under NIR laser irradiation. ICG, another kind of cyanine dye clinically approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), plays the same role as Cypate in one of our other works, while a micelle system established via a hierarchical assembly of ICG and a chemo- therapeutical drug (doxorubicin, Dox) was used for in vivo tumor treatment. [ 19a ] In fact, ICG itself can also be used as a PDT agent for tumor therapy. After loading with anti- CD117 antibody modiﬁ ed calcium phosphosilicate nano- particles, ICG was further applied speciﬁ cally to leukemia treatment. [ 56d ] Both in vitro and in vivo results showed great enhancement of the therapeutic response. In recent years, many other research groups have reported various organic dyes as NIR excited PSs for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes in cancer research. [ 57 ] In addition, many well-designed inorganic nanoparticles (such as GNMs, [ 24a , 58 ] QDs, [ 59 ] CNMs, [ 60 ] titanium dioxide nanoparticles [ 61 ] and tungsten oxide nanoparticles [ 62 ] have been applied in PDT instead of conventional organic PSs because of their ability to generate 1 O 2 under NIR illumina- tion, which provides new candidates for deep-seated tumor PDT. Gold nanomaterials including nanoparticles, nanorods, nanoshells and some other gold-based nanostructures have become known for their thermal effect induced by external light illumination in the ﬁ eld of tumor therapy. [ 63 ] Hwang’s group reported that 1 O 2 could be generated through direct sensitization of metal nanoparticles (such as Au, Ag and Pt) by light with a wavelength located in the range of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption bands. [ 64 ] The quantum yield of 1 O 2 was calculated to be higher than 0.15. Jang and Gao attributed the production of 1 O 2 to plasmonic energy transfer from hot electrons to oxygen. [ 24c , 65 ] Hwang further conﬁ rmed that 1 O 2 generation capability by metal nanopar- ticles was strongly dependent on particle morphology. [ 64 ] Very recently, they prepared a new type of multi-branched gold nanoechinus with excellent NIR single photon absorp- tion (OPA) which was capable of deep PDT. [ 8 ] The gold nanoechinus exhibited very high molar extinction coefﬁ - cient, which was 7–9 orders higher than conventional organic dyes and PSs as well as 3–4 orders higher than that of any other gold nanocomposite.

KGaA, Weinheim PDT in vivo with an excitation power 2–3 times lower than the skin burning threshold. After intratumoral injection of the newly synthesized gold nanoechinus, B16F0 melanoma tumors planted in mice were completely destructed by direct light irradiation (915-nm laser localized in the NIR I window or 1064-nm laser in the NIR II window with a power of 130 mW cm −2 for 10 min). Moreover, some other types of gold-based nanostructures such as nanoshells, [ 27b , 66 ] nanorods [ 24b , 66 ] and clusters [ 24a , 58a , 67 ] have also been con- ﬁ rmed to be capable of killing cancer cells and destructing tumors under direct NIR light irradiation. Except for the direct generation of 1 O 2 , GNRs are perfect antennae for NIR light due to the tunable surface plasmonic properties. After the surface plasmon resonance of AuNRs was ﬁ ne-tuned to overlap with the excitation absorption of ICG, both the pho- tostability and 1 O 2 quantum yield of the organic PS were greatly enhanced. [ 68 ] Although inspiring advancements as described above have been achieved, NIR-activated PSs for OPA-PDT still face some challenges: i) existing NIR-absorbing PSs are lim- ited and the synthesis of newly designed agents is difﬁ cult; ii) the extinction coefﬁ cient of most PSs in the NIR window is really low compared with that in UV-VIS range; iii) the 1 O 2 quantum yield of PSs used in this modality are much lower than that of conventional PSs under UV-VIS excitation. 3.2. Deep PDT Based on Two-Photon Absorption In order to increase the absorption of PSs in the NIR window, a TPA strategy is utilized as a new modality to initiate PDT, named as TPA-PDT. TPA is such a process in which the elec- tron of a molecule is excited from its ground state to a higher energy electronic state through simultaneous absorption of two photons with identical or different frequencies. In order to achieve simultaneous absorption, the energy source in TPA should be a short laser pulse (∼100 femtosecond) with high intensity. The energy of each excited photon should be smaller than the energy gap between the two states. Thus, NIR light is often used as the energy source that will con- sequently improve tissue penetration. Moreover, it is well known that TPA possesses a smaller focal volume than con- ventional OPA, which is advantageous for precise 3-dimen- sional selectivity in treating deep tumors. [ 69 ] In addition, PSs designed for TPA-PDT still preserve their OPA through vis- ible light for treating superﬁ cial tumor tissues beside deep ones. [ 69,70 ] TPA-PDT was ﬁ rstly demonstrated on organic PSs, and some novel PS molecules with smartly designed structures were developed. [ 69,71 ] For example, Ventura et al. developed two kinds of new TPA PSs based on porphyrin, a clinically used PS in conventional one-photon PDT. A high TPACS value (10 3 GM), robust 1 O 2 generation and efﬁ cient two- photon induced cytotoxicity were achieved. [ 71c ] However, some drawbacks still largely impeded their application for treating tumors, such as photo-induced degradation, poor water solubility and little tumor accumulation. To over- come these shortcomings, loading these PSs with nanopar- ticles is a promising strategy that has attracted tremendous efforts. [ 2 , 44b , 72 ] A nanocomposite combined PTT and TPA- PDT was fabricated by co-loading hypocrellin B (a typical TPA-PDT agent) and gold nanocages into lipid vesicles. [ 72b ] After incubation with HeLa cells, femtosecond pulsed laser at 790 nm was utilized to irradiate the system. Heat gener- ated by gold nanocages and 1 O 2 originated from activated PSs exhibited synergistic cancer cytotoxicity systematically. In another work, more than 6800 PS molecules were incorpo- rated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) through covalent encapsulation and a giant TPACS (8 × 10 6 GM) for a single nanocomposite was achieved. [ 44b ] Apart from that, with this loading manner, PSs were located in the inner part of MSNPs such that they were protected from activation by UV-VIS photons in daylight. [ 73 ] The side effect of phototox- icity, resulting from daylight exposure, is one of the main weaknesses of conventional PDT approaches that is usually solved by the nettlesome avoidance of light for a long time. After functionalization with targeted molecules, PS-loaded MSNPs could speciﬁ cally recognize receptors overexpressed on tumor cell surfaces, which resulted in very low cell via- bility under NIR irradiation. Based on in vitro results, in vivo PTA-PDT studies were further performed on nude mice bearing HCT-116 xenografts by intravenous injection of the functionalized nanocomposites. The tumor weight in mice receiving both nanocomposite injections and NIR illumina- tion (760 nm, 80 mW, 3 × 3 min), was diminished to just 30% of that in control groups. In addition, in all PTA-PDT treated mice, macrometastasis formation in the liver and colon was not observed, while it was a common occurance in control mice. [ 44b ] Except for organic PSs, many inorganic nanoparticles such as GNRs, [ 24b , 74 ] QDs [ 75 ] and CNMs [ 22b , 76 ] are found to produce 1 O 2 upon TPA with much larger TPACS and higher resistance to laser irradiation. Consequently, in many efforts for deep PDT by TPA, some nanoparticles are considered as inherent PSs or act as antennae to activate nearby PSs through an energy transfer process via TPA. Take GNRs as an example, in addition to direct activation by NIR light via OPA, they exhibit a high TPACS (10 4 GM) and obvious 1 O 2 generation through TPA modality as well. Actually, the 1 O 2 quantum yield of GNRs under TPA is signiﬁ cantly higher than traditional PSs such as RB and ICG. Moreover, the TPA-PDT effect produced by GNRs was successfully conducted on several cell lines. [ 24b ] In another typical work, silica-coated GNRs were investigated to enhance the two- photon excitation ﬂ uorescence of conjugated PSs (T790) for imaging and PDT by amplifying the local electric ﬁ eld ( Figure 7 ). [ 74a ] By adjusting the thickness of the silica shell, optimal TPA ﬂ uorescence enhancement with a factor of 11.8 was determined for a shell thickness of 20 nm. The capability of 1 O 2 generation under TPA was simultaneously improved as well. Enhanced TPA-PDT efﬁ cacy was demonstrated on HepG2 cancer cells with 50% cell suppression. TPA-PDT has been proved to be a promising method of deep-seated tumor treatment. However, many more efforts need to be devoted for further application of TPA-PDT in cancer therapy due to the following reasons. First, the alter- native PSs with large TPACS are still greatly limited. Second, to achieve optimal efﬁ cacy, pulsed laser used as a TPA light small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 www.MaterialsViews.com 5869© 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com source should be focused on a small area to obtain high power intensity, and this may be inaccessible for the treat- ment of large solid tumors. 3.3. Deep PDT Based on Upconversion An upconversion nanoparticle is a kind of lanthanide-doped nanocrystal which can convert two or more low-energy pump photons (e.g., NIR light) to a higher-energy output photon (e.g., visible or UV light), emitting strong upconversion ﬂ u- orescence in a nonlinear optical process. [ 77 ] Compared with commonly used down-conversion ﬂ uorescent nanoparti- cles such as QDs, NIR light-excitable UCNPs exhibit many advantages in biomedical applications. [ 78 ] The most remark- able one is that the excitation light for UCNPs is located in the NIR window, which permits a relatively high tissue pen- etration depth. With great development of NIR lasers (e.g., 980 nm) featuring high power intensity and low cost, UCNPs have been widely applied in biomedical ﬁ elds, [ 79 ] including UCNP-based PDT for tumor treatment. [ 40b , 42c,e , 80 ] The last several years have witnessed the eruption of UCNPs for PDT and hundreds of research papers have been published, including some exhaustive reviews. [ 1b , 4a , 81 ] Herein, we will mainly focus on the research progress of UCNP-based PDT for in vivo applications as well as some novel UCNPs that can be activated by 800 nm laser for avoiding skin thermal damage. UCNPs are usually composed of a crystal host material, a sensitizer and an activator. To acquire applicable lumines- cence, a sensitizer is essential in UCNPs for efﬁ cient absorp- tion of incidence light and then to transfer energy to a nearby activator, resulting in strong upconversion luminescence (UCL). For most of the currently used UCNPs, the sensi- tizer is a Yb 3+ ion that possesses relatively strong absorption in the NIR region. Thereby, Yb 3+ -doped UCNPs are excited with a 980 nm laser, as described in almost all of the pub- lished work. Because of the intense UCL, such UCNPs have been systematically investigated and broadly used in the ﬁ eld of deep PDT in combination with PSs. Table 1 summarizes the in vivo research works on UCNP-based PDT reported so far. It clearly shows that all of the nanoparticles used in these investigations contain Yb 3+ as sensitizer. These works highlight the great potential of such UCNPs for clinical deep PDT applications. A milestone came in 2011 when Liu’s group completed the ﬁ rst work about in vivo PDT application of UCNPs ( Figure 8 ). [ 27a ] After the decoration of OA-coated UCNPs with a PEGylated amphiphilic polymer, Ce6 was incorpo- rated into the thin hydrophobic layer formed by alkane chains of polymer and OA with a loading capacity at 6–8% (w/w). For in vitro PDT application, the fabricated UCNP- Ce6 nanocomposites exhibited signiﬁ cant proliferation inhi- bition on 4T1 cells under the illumination of a 980 nm laser for 10 min at a power intensity of 0.5 W cm − 2 . In sharp con- trast, cells without UCNP-Ce6 or laser irradiation showed small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 7.

KGaA, Weinheim no obvious damage. For animal experiments, PDT efﬁ cacy was investigated by intratumoral injection of UCNP-Ce6 (20 mg ml − 1 UCNP, ≈1.5 mg ml − 1 Ce6) into 4T1 murine breast tumors grown on BABL/C mice. Compared with the control groups, excellent tumor growth inhibition and pro- longed animal survival time were recorded for the group receiving UCNP-Ce6 injections and 980 nm light irradia- tion (0.5 W cm −2 for 30 min). Interestingly, the remarkably increased tissue penetration depth of PDT induced by NIR was demonstrated by biological tissue blocking experiments. When a piece of pork tissue with a thickness of 3 mm was placed between the light source and the samples, 1 O 2 gen- erated by UCNP-Ce6 under 980 nm excitation was main- tained at a decent level. Meanwhile, that under 660-nm laser irradiation was dramatically decreased by 80%. Fur- ther increasing the thickness of pork tissue to 8 mm, 1 O 2 generation decreased by 50% under the illumination of a 980 nm laser while no 1 O 2 could be detected when excited at660 nm. In vivo tissue blocking investigations also demon- strated the great enhancement of penetration depth of PDT based on a UCNP-Ce6 nanocomposite activated by NIR compared to traditional PDT modalities relying on visible light. Not only organic photosensitizing molecules, but also inorganic nanomaterials such as TiO 2 nanoparticles can be used as PSs. [ 61b , 83,85 ] For example, TiO 2 nanoparticle-depos- ited NaGdF 4 :Yb,Tm UCNPs were fabricated by Wu and co-workers. [ 61b ] In vitro tests demonstrated that the nano- composites could generate a reasonable amount of 1 O 2 and induce a signiﬁ cant decrease in tumor cell viability under the irradiation of a 980 nm laser. The tumor inhibition ratio could reach up to about 88.6% when MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice were treated with TiO 2 -UCNPs plus NIR illumination for 2 weeks. Compared with organic PSs, TiO 2 nanoparticles can be loaded by UCNPs with high efﬁ ciency and high sta- bility, which result in reproducible therapeutic efﬁ cacy. [ 83 ] Although signiﬁ cant progress was achieved in the above- mentioned work, some obstacles remain. For example, 1 O 2 production under NIR light was only one ﬁ fth of that under 660 nm light, which is mainly attributed to the low UCL quantum yields of UCNPs in this study. [ 27a ] Actually, low UCL quantum yield is one of the most remarkable short- ages of UCNPs and that has greatly limited the application of these nanomaterials. Therefore, new strategies for improving UCL intensity are urgently required. In 2012, a new kind of Mn 2+ co-doped NaYF 4 :Yb,Er UCNP with enhanced red UCL was reported by Zhao’s group. [ 26 ] After optimization, the introduction of 30 mol% Mn 2+ ions resulted in an enhance- ment of red emission 15 times greater than that of Mn 2+ - free UCNPs. Simultaneously, the green emission was almost diminished, indicating the converging of emission energy to the red band due to the disturbance of transition possibilities between green and red emissions of Er 3+ by Mn 2+ . Inspired by this strategy, Liu’s group developed another efﬁ cient pH-sen- sitive PDT system for in vivo applications with Mn 2+ -doped NaYF 4 :Yb,Er UCNPs ( Figure 9 ). [ 41a ] The synthesized UCNPs showed a strong single emission peak around 660 nm, located in the absorption band of Ce6. Following that, multiple layers of Ce6-conjugated polymers and charge-reversible polymers were decorated onto the surface of UCNPs with a layer-by- layer self-assembly approach. In a physiological environment with a pH value of 7.4, the nanoparticles were negatively charged with PEG decorating. However, when the solution is slightly acidic, such as in the tumor tissue with pH 6.8, the PEG chain was cleaved and the surface charge was reversed to positive. The charge-reversible nanocomposites were con- ﬁ rmed as perfect carriers for drug delivery due to the signiﬁ - cantly enhanced cellular internalization and prolonged tumor retention. After the loading of optimal Ce6-conjugated polymers, PDT effects were investigated on 4T1 cells and 4T1 tumors grown on BABL/C mice after intratumoral injection. small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Table 1.

KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com Compared to charge-irreversible nanoparticles and other controls, the charge-reversible UCNPs coated with two layers of Ce6 showed greater capability in both cancer cell killing and tumor growth inhibition under 980 nm laser irradiation (0.5 W cm −2 , 30 min). Aside from the Mn 2+ -doping strategy, Zhang and col- leagues proposed another efﬁ cient way to improve the UCNP-based PDT efﬁ cacy by co-loading of two kinds of PSs for making out most of the UCL ( Figure 10 ). [ 40a ] It is gener- ally known that UCNPs exhibit multiple emission peaks under small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 9.

Take NaYF 4 :Yb,Er UCNPs as an example, they show bright green emission around 550 nm and relatively weak emission in the red band. Only the weak red emission is used while Ce6 molecules are used as the PSs. The strong green emission does not anticipate the FRET process and its energy is wasted. [ 27a ] To make full use of the energy from UCNPs, two kinds of PS, merocyanine 540 (MC540) and zinc (II) phthalocyanine (ZnPc), whose absorption matched well with the two main emission peaks of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er UCNPs, were simultaneously embedded into the pores of silica-mod- iﬁ ed UCNPs. Under the illumination of NIR light, both PSs were activated by multi-emissions from UCNPs. Compared to single PS loading, approaches using dual PSs showed higher PDT efﬁ cacy, proved by the enhanced 1 O 2 generation and reduced cell viability. After conjugation with folic acid (FA) and PEG, the multifunctional nanocomposites showed pro- longed circulation time and enhanced tumor tissue targeting when intravenously injected into melanoma tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. Signiﬁ cant inhibition of tumor growth was observed under 980 nm laser illumination (415 mW cm −2 ). As mentioned above and published else where, [ 21a , 41c , 42a,b,d , 61b , 82–84 ] great progress has been made by Yb 3+ sensitized UCNPs for deep PDT. However, the physically unalterable activation light peak at 980 nm overlaps with the maximum absorption band of water mol- ecules which results in some undesirable consequences. [ 12 ] One is serious attenuation of incident laser power resulting from water absorption and scattering, leading to decreased penetration depth. Another one is photo damage to cells and tissues caused by overheating of water molecules after absorbing excitation light. These unexpected effects are espe- cially more severe in deep tissue PDT because of the require- ment of good penetrability, high power density and long-term irradiation for excitation light. As can be clearly seen from Figure 1 , the absorption of water and hemoglobin maintains a minimum value around 800 nm. UCNPs that can be excited at 800 nm seem to be ideal candidates to overcome the short- ages of the 980 nm laser used in Yb 3+ -sensitized UCNPs. Thus, many efforts have been devoted in developing 800 nm- excitable UCNPs for deep tissue application without water overheating. [ 48c , 87 ] For Yb 3+ sensitized UCNPs, only very weak UCL can be detected under 800 nm excitation due to the scarce absorp- tion of Yb 3+ at wavelengths shorter than 900 nm. After the modiﬁ cation of NaYF 4 :Yb,Er UCNPs with IR-806, an organic dye with an extinction coefﬁ cient 5 × 10 6 times higher than that of UCNPs at 806 nm, and strong lumines- cence overlapping well with UCNPs’ absorption band, the overall UCL intensity under 800 nm excitation was dramati- cally enhanced by a factor of ≈ 3300 resulting from efﬁ cient energy transfer. [ 87b ] Although intense UCL was obtained in this study, organic dyes used as antenna molecules were sus- ceptible to photobleaching, such that they could not undergo long-time irradiation. To obtain strong and stable UCL small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 10.

KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com emission at the excitation of 800-nm light for potential use in deep PDT, Nd 3+ -doped UCNPs were developed based on conventional Yb 3+ -sensitized ones. Nd 3+ ions were utilized as primary sensitizers co-doped with Yb 3+ to fabricate UCNPs with 800 nm excitation owing to its sharp absorption band centered around 800 nm. The ﬁ rst generation of Nd 3+ -sen- sitized UCNPs are Yb/Er/Nd tri-doped nanoparticles. [ 87a ] Because of the high extinction coefﬁ cient of Nd 3+ , these UCNPs showed UCL 20 times stronger than Nd 3+ free ones under 800 nm irradiation. However, UCL intensity of these materials cannot be further elevated due to the quenching of energy caused by cross relaxation between activators (Er 3+ , Tm 3+ , Ho 3+ ) and Nd 3+ . Aiming to suppress the quenching effect, the doping concentration of Nd 3+ is usually less than 1%, which leads to less absorption of incidence energy. To address and tackle this contradiction, core-shell structured (the second generation) Nd 3+ -sensitized UCNPs were devel- oped. [ 88 ] With activators located in the core for emitting and high concentrations of Nd 3+ in the shell for harvesting photons, UCL with 800 nm light excitation was dramatically enhanced and the mechanism was clearly elucidated. [ 88a ] Moreover, Yan et al. demonstrated that as-prepared UCNPs could be used for in vivo imaging at 800 nm excitation with minimized heat generation. [ 88b ] Technically, cross-relaxation still exists at the interface of the core and shell. To elimi- nate ﬂ uorescence quenching completely, Yao and colleagues proposed the third generation of Nd 3+ -sensitized UCNPs: a sandwich structure with a transition layer between the activa- tors and sensitizers ( Figure 11 ). [ 48c ] Owing to the transition layer, non-radiation energy transfer from activators in the core to Nd 3+ in the shell was totally blocked, even at a high Nd 3+ concentration (90%). As a result, UCL of Nd 3+ -sensi- tized UCNPs overruns that of Yb 3+ -sensitized UCNPs for the ﬁ rst time. Modiﬁ ed with Tween-80, these multifunctional nan- oparticles showed good colloidal stability, maintained more than 80% of UCL and revealed clear imaging of labeled cells. Although no literature has presented applications of 800 nm-activated UCNPs for PDT until now, we envision great potential of Nd 3+ -sensitized UCNPs for bio-imaging and PDT in deep tissue in the near future based on the encour- aging investigations mentioned above. Because of their unique characteristics, UCNP-based multifunctional nanocomposites can play more roles in the ﬁ eld of tumor treatment except for NIR-triggered PDT. For example, Gd-doped UCNPs and superparamagnetic-upcon- version nanocomposites have shown potential applications in cancer therapy and multimodal imaging (ﬂ uorescence imaging, MR imaging and CT imaging). [ 61b , 79b , 82,89 ] This capa- bility enables the visualization of tumor therapies, allowing one to monitor therapy efﬁ cacy and assess the prognosis. In addition to imaging, combination therapy can be realized easily when UCNPs are used as drug carriers. [ 90 ] Anti-tumor chemotherapy drugs and thermal therapy agents can be co- loaded by UCNPs through covalent conjugation or physical adsorption similarly to PSs. PDT alone is usually not efﬁ cient enough to eradicate tumors completely because of the com- plex microenvironment of the tumor. Synergetic strategies by combining two or more cancer treatment approaches can small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 11.

KGaA, Weinheim launch new prospects, such as the combination of PDT and PTT, and PDT and chemotherapy. 4. X-ray Excited Deep PDT Efﬁ cient PDT is the combination of PSs, light and oxygen. For PDT to work properly, light of an appropriate wave- length with enough intensity should be delivered to the PSs. Unfortunately, PDT for deep-seated tumors is greatly limited by the tissue penetration depth of irradiation light. Although different approaches of NIR-triggered PDT carry promising prospects for deep-seated tumor therapy, some problems still exist: 1) PSs activated by NIR are notoriously difﬁ cult to design and synthesize; [ 91 ] 2) the energy gap of NIR-absorbing PSs is narrow; [ 92 ] 3) the quantum yield of 1 O 2 is usually low; [ 92 ] 4) most important of all, the tissue penetration depth of NIR light is only 1.5 cm while retaining enough energy to stimulate PSs. In sharp contrast to NIR light, X-ray that is widely used in clinical cancer diagnosis (with a KeV photon energy) and therapy (with a MeV photon energy) possesses an almost lim- itless penetration pathway in tissue. As a result, this ionizing radiation energy is believed to be a potential candidate to ini- tiate PDT in deep-seated tumors. However, the direct activa- tion of clinically used PSs by X-ray is not accessible due to the scant absorption of radiation by PSs. Thus, a transducer is indispensable to bridge the energy transfer from X-ray to PSs. Nanoparticles with intense radioluminescence, such as ScNPs and afterglow nanoparticles, are competent for this role. With shrewd assembly, an efﬁ cient FRET pair between these nano- particles and corresponding PSs can be fabricated. In this way, X-ray could be used as the excitation source to trigger deep PDT, thoroughly breaking through the limit of tissue penetra- tion depth of irradiation light. This new PDT modality can be named X-ray excited PDT (XE-PDT) and the relative pub- lished investigations are summarized in Table 2 . 4.1. XE-PDT Based on ScNPs A scintillator is a kind of material that can be excited by ion- izing radiation to emit down-conversion luminescence in the UV-VIS region. Due to this unique property, scintillators are widely used as radiation detectors in the ﬁ elds of security checks and medical diagnostics. Nano-scale scintillators with appropriate ion doping exhibit some excellent properties because of their surface-interface effects, quantum conﬁ ne- ment effects and dielectric conﬁ nement effects. [ 29b , 100 ] Most notably, nanocrystallization enables scintillators to be useful for in vivo applications. X-ray excited PDT based on ScNPs was ﬁ rstly proposed and conﬁ rmed by Chen’s group. [ 28b ] It is generally known that 1 O 2 is the key element for cancer cytotoxicity during the PDT process. Thus, to vali- date the feasibility of XE-PDT, 1 O 2 generation under X-ray should be proved ﬁ rst. Because of the good overlap between the excitation peak of meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (MTCP) and the emission band of LaF 3 :Tb, water soluble LaF 3 :Tb-MTCP conjugates with size of about 15 nm were fabricated by Chen’s group and efﬁ cient FRET was observed under X-ray irradiation. [ 18 ] It was found that the amount of 1 O 2 generated by LaF 3 :Tb-MTCP nanocomposites upon X-ray irradiation (0.44 Gy min −1 , 250 KeV for 30 min) was almost two times higher than that by MTCP alone, indicating the efﬁ cient transducer role of LaF 3 :Tb in XE-PDT. Further modiﬁ cation with targeting molecules such as folic acid did not affect the quantum yield of 1 O 2 . [ 18 ] Additionally, Chen conducted XE-PDT investigations in vitro. [ 93 ] In this study, LaF 3 :Ce nanoparticles and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) were co-encapsulated into polymer microspheres to establish an efﬁ cient FRET system. Upon exposure of X-ray irradiation (90 KeV, 0.5 Gy min −1 ), an adequate amount of 1 O 2 was gen- erated, which could induce prostate cancer cell damage. Sub- cellular experiments displayed oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and DNA fragmentation in cells, further indicating that X-ray could activate ScNP-PSs for cancer destruction. Very recently, SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires were conju- gated with porphyrin derivatives to evaluate the XE-PDT efﬁ cacy in vitro. Efﬁ cient reduction of cell population (75%) was achieved on lung adenocarcinoma cells at low X-ray doses (0.4–2 Gy). [ 96 ] Employing this new XE-PDT modality in vivo is a chal- lenging issue. Chen and colleagues reported interesting research employing a newly invented Cu-cysteamine (Cu– Cy) complex. [ 94 ] Nanoparticles fabricated with this new small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Table 2.

KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com compound showed ultra-strong luminescence and a signiﬁ - cant yield of 1 O 2 under direct UV or X-ray irradiation. [ 101 ] The 1 O 2 generation efﬁ ciency of Cu–Cy nanoparticles under UV excitation is comparable to PPIX (commercially avail- able PS). More notably, under X-ray excitation, much more 1 O 2 is generated by Cu–Cy nanoparticles. Based on their observations, the 1 O 2 generation ability of Cu–Cy nanopar- ticles is stronger than any other known PS with X-ray activa- tion. These nanoparticles may open a new avenue toward the goal of X-ray excited deep PDT. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Cu–Cy nanoparticles pos- sess slight toxicity even at a high concentrations, indicating acceptable biosafety of the new compound. Upon X-ray irra- diation, Cu-Cy nanoparticles exhibited great enhancement of MCF-7 cell destruction due to abundant 1 O 2 generation. At last, the XE-PDT efﬁ cacy was evaluated on tumor bearing nude mice by intratumoral injection of Cu–Cy nanoparti- cles. Without radiation, the tumors grew along with the time. While upon X-ray irradiation (90 KeV, 5 Gy), tumor growth was greatly inhibited. The diameter of tumors treated with both Cu–Cy nanoparticles and radiation was only 30% of that treated with nanoparticles alone. However, for achieving the desired efﬁ cacy, X-ray doses employed in this work were comparable or even higher than the fractional doses used in clinical radiotherapy. [ 102 ] Very recently, Xie and co-workers successfully constructed SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2+ (SAO)-mediated deep PDT system for in vivo cancer treatment under low- dose X-ray irradiation (0.5 Gy) ( Figure 12 ). [ 95 ] SAO nano- particles (about 80 nm in diameter) were synthesized with a vapor-phase deposition method through a carbothermal reaction, followed by mechanical grinding, sedimentation, ﬁ l- tration and centrifugation. After coating with an inner layer of solid silica and an outer layer of mesoporous silica, they were decorated with MC540 by porous loading. Attributing to the good overlap between the scintillating luminescence of SAO and the excitation wavelength of MC540, much 1 O 2 was induced by SAO@SiO 2 -MC540 nanocomposites under irradiation of an 1-Gy h −1 X-ray. More than 60% of cancer cells that co-incubated with SAO@SiO 2 -MC540 nanocom- posites were dead upon X-ray irradiation, while the viability of cells treated with X-ray alone or with the nanocomposites in the absence of X-ray irradiation was nearly unaffected. In vivo studies distinctly demonstrated that tumor growth was largely inhibited when SAO-MC540 nanocomposites were intratumorally injected into tumor-bearing mice, followed by 0.5-Gy X-ray irradiation. Excluding the encouraging progress mentioned above, some other efforts have been spent on the development of XE-PDT. [ 30b , 53,97 ] However, generally speaking, the XE-PDT modality is not so satisfying in terms of 1 O 2 quantum yield, cancer-cell-killing efﬁ cacy and tumor inhibition results, espe- cially compared to the signiﬁ cant therapy response in NIR small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 12.

KGaA, Weinheim induced PDT and other therapy modalities. Based on the summary of research progress discussed above, the following main characteristics should be featured by ScNP-PSs to achieve the optimal XE-PDT efﬁ cacy: 1) high X-ray stopping power for efﬁ cient absorption of radioactive energy; 2) con- siderable scintillation efﬁ ciency for intense UV-VIS light emission; 3) well overlapping of ScNPs’ emission with PSs’ absorption; 4) close proximity of distance between ScNPs and PSs for efﬁ cient energy transfer; 5) appropriate surface modiﬁ cation for efﬁ cient cell internalization and tumor accu- mulation; 6) high stability in physiological environments and good biocompatibility. However until now there is no kind of ScNP-PS system that can satisfy all of the afore-mentioned requirements. To improve XE-PDT efﬁ cacy, several sugges- tions are given below, based on systematic summary and intense analysis of recently published literature. 1) The intensity of X-ray stimulated luminescence is vital for PS activation. To improve XE-PDT efﬁ cacy, ScNPs with stronger emission under X-ray irradiation should be prepared. For inorganic nanophosphors, it is widely known that the luminescence intensity is related to the composition, morphology, size and surface property of the nanoparticles. [ 103 ] This principle is applicable to ScNPs as well. Composition including the host material and dop- ing ions can greatly affect the scintillating luminescence of ScNPs. Usually, host materials with higher density pos- sesses greater X-ray stopping power. Thus, phosphors containing high atomic number elements are supposed to exhibit enhanced scintillating luminescence efﬁ - ciency, such as rare earth-based nanoparticles (LaF 3 :Tb, CeO 2 :Eu, Lu 2 O 3 :Eu, NaGdF 4 :Eu). [ 104 ] The doping ions in these scintillating nanoparticles often act as activators, which have multiple effects on the luminescence efﬁ cien- cy. Increasing the doping concentration will shorten the exciton (electron-hole pair) migration pathway, leading to enhanced luminescence intensity. On the other hand, over-doping concentrations elevate the probability that activators will self-quench, inducing a decrease in ﬂ uo- rescence. Thus, for ion-doped ScNPs, there usually exists an optimal concentration of activators. [ 104a,b ] For example, LaF 3 nanoparticles with different doping concentrations of Tb 3+ were prepared in our group. Those with 10% Tb 3+ doping exhibited the strongest ﬂ uorescence. In another study, Kennedy et al. demonstrated that the strongest emission was achieved with 15% Eu 3+ doping for both cubic and hexagonal NaGdF 4 :Eu nanoparticles. [ 104c ] How- ever, nanoparticles with a cubic crystal structure showed only half ﬂ uorescence intensity of hexagonal crystals, in- dicating the heavy inﬂ uence of crystal phase on scintil- lating luminescence. Due to the large surface-to-volume ratio, the radioluminescence intensity of ScNPs is highly sensitive to the surface state. Sometimes decreasing the size of the nanoparticles may result in an enhancement of the ﬂ uorescence quantum yield, but this method does not always work well. [ 29b , 105 ] To improve the emission inten- sity, coating the nanoparticles with a layer of inert shell seems to be the most efﬁ cient way. [ 104b , 106 ] As was shown by Chen, the X-ray luminescence intensity of LaF 3 :Tb was enhanced more than four times after being coated with an outer layer of LaF 3 shell. [ 29a ] Overall, the optimization of X-ray luminescence of ScNPs is still in the early stage and only a few works have been carried out. More system- atic investigations are necessary for further understanding and to improve XE-PDT efﬁ cacy. 2) For XE-PDT, the ﬁ nal therapeutic response is heavily de- pendent on the energy transfer efﬁ ciency from antenna Sc- NPs to PSs, which is seriously affected by the spectrum over- lap. In all published research about ScNP-based XE-PDT, most of the PSs used are porphyrin or their derivatives, as we can see from Table 2 . These PS molecules possess a max- imal absorption band below 400 nm and several weaker satellite absorption bands between 450–600 nm. However, activators utilized in these works are Tb 3+ or Ce 3+ ions ex- hibiting strong emission between 450–600 nm, which over- laps poorly with the absorption of porphyrin derivatives. Thus, establishing appropriate ScNP-PS FRET pairs with a better spectral overlap is another promising avenue to en- hance XE-PDT efﬁ cacy. To strive for this purpose, ScNPs with different emissions to match the absorption of PSs are urgently desired. In one work, LaF 3 :Tb-MTCP nanocom- posites were constructed for XE-PDT. [ 18 ] The FRET efﬁ - ciency between ScNPs and PSs was calculated to be only 57%. Once ZnO nanoparticles were used as the donors in- stead of LaF 3 :Tb, energy transfer efﬁ ciency was increased to 83% due to the better spectral match. [ 98 ] Fortunately, phosphors with various emission spectra can be obtained through doping of different ions. [ 104c , 105,107 ] In long-term investigations, several ScNPs with intense X-ray lumines- cence, such as MgF 2 :Mn 2+ ,Eu 2+ , [ 107 ] LaF 3 :Ce 3+ ,Tb 3+ [ 29a ] and CeO 2 :Eu 3+ [ 104a ] were reported. Interestingly, their emis- sions are located at blue (350–450 nm), green (500–575 nm) and red (600–650 nm) bands respectively. The multicolor emissions will beneﬁ t the overlap with various PS absorp- tion spectra leading to more efﬁ cient energy transfer in ScNP-PS system. To further extend the scintillation lu- minescence band, QDs were integrated with LaF 3 :Ce nanoparticles and enhanced QD ﬂ uorescence was clearly observed upon both UV and X-ray excitation. [ 108 ] Due to the size-dependent emission of QDs, the emission peak of ScNPs-QD complexes can simply be tuned to any desired wavelength by controlling the size of the QDs. For a given ScNP, choosing an appropriate PS also plays an important role in the energy transfer process. Based on a systematic summary and thorough analysis of the research progress, we proposed a LaF 3 :Tb-Rose Bengal system which will be a promising FRET pair for XE-PDT after considering the X-ray luminescence, spectrum match and 1 O 2 generation ( Figure 13 ). Monodispersive LaF 3 :Tb hexagonal nanoparti- cles with nano-sized pores were successfully prepared by a user-friendly and facile hydrothermal process. Under UV or X-ray excitation, as-obtained nanoparticles exhibited typical, intense Tb 3+ luminescence. The main emission band at 544 nm overlapped exactly with the main absorption of RB at 549 nm. After loading RB with LaF 3 :Tb ScNPs, the FRET efﬁ ciency was calculated to be as high as 85% from steady- state spectra and ﬂ uorescence delay dynamic analysis. Under small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 www.MaterialsViews.com 5877© 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com external irradiation, a large amount of 1 O 2 was detected owing to the effect of the FRET process. [ 109 ] Subsequent researches based on LaF 3 :Tb-RB FRET pairs are underway in our group. 1) An appropriate loading approach of PSs to ScNPs is an- other key factor to achieve high energy transfer efﬁ ciency in FRET. [ 110 ] In published research cases about XE-PDT, co-location, covalent conjugation and physical loading were all employed for loading PSs to ScNPs, as showed in Table 2 . However, in these works, little information about PS loading capacity and the distance between PSs and Sc- NPs was discussed, not to mention the inﬂ uence of these parameters to the ﬁ nal XE-PDT efﬁ cacy. Thus, more atten- tion should be devoted to the assembly process to obtain optimal PS loading. 2) Stopping power for a given material is strongly dependent on the energy of X-ray photons. Thus, to obtain intense X- ray luminescence, the energy of the external X-ray must be taken into consideration. As calculated by Capala and co- workers, ScNPs excited by X-rays with photon energies be- low ≈200 KeV gave a substantially greater cytotoxic effect in XE-PDT when several different X-ray energies (30 KeV, 50 KeV, 200 KeV, 300 KeV, 1 MeV and 10 MeV) were com- pared. The cytotoxic effect reached its peak value for X- rays with an energy around 50 KeV. [ 111 ] These conclusions give some vital guidance for XE-PDT, but the data pre- sented are just computational results based on a series of assumptions without any experimental evidence. Further comparison experiments are indispensable to make the conclusions more authoritative. 3) For the application of XE-PDT modality in biological systems, reasonable surface properties of the ScNP-PS nanocomposites should be considered, such as hydrophilic modiﬁ cation for better colloidal stability, PEGylation for enhanced blood circulation and EPR effects, and target ligand decoration for active targeting. 4.2. Deep PDT Based on Afterglow Nanoparticles Afterglow or persistence nanoparticles are phosphors with the luminescence lasting for a certain period of time, ranging from a few minutes to tens of hours. The mechanism of this luminescence process is illustrated simply by Chen. [ 28b ] After activation by high-energy irradiation, the energy of excited electrons is stored in defects or electron traps. Then, with the thermal beaching of heat, the stored energy is activated to escape from the traps accompanied with intense afterglow without further external excitation. It was considered that the optimal afterglow luminescence can be acquired with an energy level of 0.95 eV. [ 28a ] Various types of irradiation can be applied to activate afterglow materials, such as UV light, [ 112 ] visible light [ 113 ] and X-ray. [ 99 ] As afterglow nanoparticles can be activated under X-ray and emit intense UV-VIS light similar to ScNPs, another XE-PDT modality utilizing afterglow nanoparticles was pro- posed. This new modality possesses all the advantages of small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 13.

KGaA, Weinheim ScNP-based XE-PDT. Moreover, due to the long delay life- time of afterglow, the excitation X-ray dosage and duration time for efﬁ cient PDT can be greatly reduced. Additionally, afterglow nanoparticles can be activated in vitro followed by delivery to target tissue to start PDT procedures. In this concept, there is no more dependence on an external light source and radiation damage of healthy tissue will no longer exist. [ 28a ] To strive for the purpose of utilizing afterglow nanopar- ticles for deep PDT, 4-nm ZnS:Cu,Co nanoparticles with a strong afterglow emission at around 525 nm and high water solubility were synthesized. [ 112a ] After ageing for two weeks, the afterglow intensity of the nanoparticles increased more than 7 times due to partial oxidation of the particle surface. [ 112b ] The oxidation led to more electron traps which were responsible for the afterglow enhancement. Similar afterglow emission from ZnS:Cu,Co nanoparticles could also be recorded under X-ray excitation ( Figure 14 ). [ 99 ] To obtain efﬁ cient energy transfer in XE-PDT based on afterglow nano- particles, PS molecules (TBrRh123) were covalently attached on the surface of ZnS:Cu,Co nanoparticles. Owing to the close adjoining distance and good spectral overlap between the donor and acceptor molecules, an efﬁ cient FRET pair was established. When human prostate cancer cells (PC3) were treated with NP-PS nanocomposites and X-ray (2 Gy) simultaneously, cell metabolic activity decreased to about 40%. Nearly no cell damage was observed when they were treated with X-ray or NP-PSs alone. It is important to note that the X-ray dosage employed in this study is only 2 Gy, which is much lower than that in ScNP-based XE-PDT, men- tioned above (13.2 Gy). [ 18 ] The reason contributing to the signiﬁ cant reduction of X-ray dosage is the long lasting time of afterglow derived from ZnS:Cu,Co nanoparticles, leading to sustained generation of 1 O 2 for cell destruction after moving off the excitation energy source. Except for acting as antennae in PDT, afterglow nanoparticles with NIR emis- sion were extensively applied in small animal imaging [ 114 ] and drug carrier monitoring [ 115 ] in vivo without an external light source, resulting in ultra-low background noise. For example, NIR-emitting (695 nm) Zn 2.94 Ga 1.96 Ge 2 O 10 :Cr 3+ ,Pr 3+ long afterglow nanoparticles were synthesized by Yan and co- workers with a citrate sol-gel method. [ 114a ] The co-doping of Cr 3+ and Pr 3+ signiﬁ cantly enhanced the persistent lumi- nescence of the nanoparticles. After modiﬁ cation with PEG and c(RGDyK) peptide, the nanoparticles were successfully used for in vivo targeted tumor imaging with good biocom- patibility and low toxicity. The luminescence signals still appeared in tumor sites at 12 min post-intravenous injection. Thus, there is great potential for afterglow nanoparticles to establish theranostic nanoplatforms in PDT. 4.3. Other Tumor Theranostic Modalities Induced by X-ray Beside PSs, X-ray excited ScNPs can be utilized as light source for other agents in cancer therapy, such as psoralen. Psoralen is a mutagen widely used in “psoralen + UVA” treatment and it functions analogously to PS for its sensitivity to light and ability to induce cell death after light activation. However, the undergoing mechanism is quite different. In psoralen-induced therapy, the cytotoxicity is attributed to covalent interstrand cross-linking of adenine and thymine residues in the genome, which is actually independent of oxygen molecules. As we know, a hypoxia environment of tumor tissues is a serious small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 14.

KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.com limitation for the generation of 1 O 2 in PDT for cancer treat- ment. [ 116 ] Thus, psoralen was utilized as an anti-cancer agent instead of PSs to circumvent this predicament. After psoralen molecules were covalently conjugated onto ScNPs (Y 2 O 3 nanoparticles with a diameter of 12 nm), the ScNP-psoralen nanocomposites were co-cultured with PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. Upon X-ray irradiation (2 Gy, 160 or 320 KeV), concentration-dependent reduction of cell number was recorded. More than 20% enhanced cell killing efﬁ cacy was achieved compared with ScNPs alone. [ 117 ] In addition, X-ray could also be applied to trigger the release of drugs teth- ered with nanocarriers for immediate clinical applications in cancer treatments. For example, ROS induced by X-ray was employed to break DNA strands and aggravate DOX release from GNMs in tumor tissue. [ 118 ] In combination with X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), the amount of drug released into the cells could be quantitatively monitored. [ 119 ] Furthermore, X-ray excitable nanoparticles have been investigated for further applications in deep-tissue molecular imaging in vivo through different techniques, such as X-ray luminescence optical tomography (XLOT), [ 104c ] X-ray lumi- nescence computed tomography (XLCT) [ 120 ] and Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI). [ 121 ] CLI, as an emerging topic in molecular imaging, has attracted extensive research interest in the past two years. [ 122 ] CLI is a physical emission phenomenon that happens when a charged particle travels at a speed beyond the speed of light in a dielectric medium. After years of sustained attention, we have made great progress in applying CLI for moni- toring drug delivery [ 123 ] and endoscopic imaging. [ 124 ] After integration with gold nanoparticles, a tissue-penetrating CLI signal between 620–800 was obtained, which is really suitable for in vivo optical imaging ( Figure 15 ). [ 125 ] Moreover, in a proof-of-concept study, ﬁ ber-based CLI was utilized to detect the tumor tissue in vivo for image guided surgery. [ 126 ] Most importantly, CLI was proposed to active PS previously as well. [ 127 ] Although XE-PDT is still in its development stage and not more than a dozen papers have been published for inves- tigating XE-PDT, it is considered to be the fundamental solu- tion to surmount the limited activation depth in conventional PDT. This modality will show incremental importance in deep lesion treatment especially when combined with other X-ray induced theranostic approaches. 5. Internal Light Excited PDT Internal light excited PDT (ILE-PDT) is considered as another novel therapy modality for deep-seated tumors. The mechanism of ILE-PDT is brieﬂ y illustrated in Figure 16 . In this process, the PSs are activated by chemiluminescence or bioluminescence, which is a light emission phenomenon resulting from a chemical or biological reaction. In the pres- ence of an appropriate substrate and catalyst, the “silent” luminescence centers (such as luminol and luciferin) are lighted to emit UV-VIS ﬂ uorescence that can be absorbed by PSs nearby to trigger PDT processes. As a result, no external light source is involved in the therapy procedure leading to no more concern about the limited penetration depth and small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Figure 15.

By employing appropriate loading approaches, ILE systems are integrated with PS molecules. In the presence of an oxidant or enzyme, luminol or luciferin can be excited to emit intense UV-VIS luminescence. Due to the efﬁ cient energy transfer process, adjacent PSs are excited. Subsequently, PDT process is initiated in deep body and abundant 1 O 2 is produced to eliminate tumor tissue. In this concept, an external light source is no longer necessary. reviews www.MaterialsViews.com 5880 www.small-journal.com © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim tissue damage of excitation light, as exists in other PDT modalities. Table 3 shows the summary of published works concerning ILE-PDT. 5.1. Luminol-Based ILE-PDT Luminol, as a common emission substrate in chemilumines- cence, is widely used in forensic medicine for the detection of ﬁ nger prints or trace amounts of blood. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a suitable catalyst such as iron or periodate compound, or horseradish peroxidase (HRP), luminol is oxidized to an excited intermediate 3-aminoph- thalate. When the vibronic excited state decays to a lower energy level, a blue glow with a maximum luminescence peak at 425 nm is emitted. As mentioned above, many PSs have the strongest extinction coefﬁ cient in the UV-VIS range, so luminol is an ideal activator to trigger PDT without external light illumination. [ 128 ] Lin’s group reported several papers focusing on this novel deep PDT modality for therapy of colorectal carcinoma, a tumor typically located in the inner body. [ 39b , 129 ] 5-ami- nolevulinic acid (5-ALA), which could be converted into PPIX enzymatically via the heme biosynthetic pathway, was employed as PS in their PDT system because of the spectrum overlap for luminol emission and PPIX absorption. [ 129 ] Once added to cell culture media accompanied with luminol and FeSO 4 , 5-ALA showed signiﬁ cant cell toxicity after 72-hour incubation. Meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)-chlorin (m-THPC) is an extensively used second generation photosensitive drug for cancer treatment because it can be activated by NIR light at 650 nm. m-THPC has another absorption peak at 420 nm with an extinction coefﬁ cient approximately 5 times higher than that at 650 nm. However, few studies have been con- cerned with the PDT effects of m-THPC at an excitation of 420 nm due to the limited penetration depth of the photons. Nevertheless, Wang’s group proposed an innovative idea by utilizing a luminol-H 2 O 2 -HRP chemiluminescence system as an internal light source to activate m-THPC for PDT and imaging of cancer cells. [ 130 ] By integrating HRP and semi- conducting polymer dots, m-THPC could be excited directly through chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) or through CRET and subsequent FRET while polymer dots were used as transducers. The luminol-based ILE-PDT system showed signiﬁ cant toxicity to various cells including MCF-7 breast cancer cells, C6 glioma cells, and NIH 3T3 ﬁ broblast cells. Oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (OPV) is a cationic PS with a broad absorption band in the range of 350−550 nm, which matches well with the emission of luminol. Wang and colleagues established a luminol-OPV system by electro- static interaction for treating cancer and microbial infections ( Figure 17 ). [ 41d ] With the addition of OPV, the luminescence intensity of luminol at 425 nm decreased dramatically, accom- panied with a gradual increase of the luminescence of OPV. This phenomenon supports the occurrence of CRET. HeLa cells suffered signiﬁ cantly enhanced damage resulting from OPV when co-incubated with luminol-H 2 O 2 -HRP. Wang et al. further extended the applications of ILE-PDT in vivo. Nude mice inoculated with HeLa cells were subcutaneously injected with different therapeutic agents alongside con- trols. Neither luminol luminescence system nor OPV alone was capable of inhibiting the growth of tumors, while in the group injected with luminol-OPV, the tumor growth rate slowed down prominently by 30%. Moreover, the addition of luminol luminescence enhancer (PC 3 SO 3 Na) could further increase therapeutic efﬁ cacy, achieving a tumor inhibition ratio of 55%. 5.2. Luciferin-Based ILE-PDT When chemiluminescence occurs with the assistance of bio- molecules existing in living organisms, the phenomenon is called bioluminescence. The light-emitting components in this process generally involve the use of luciferin. Biolumi- nescence occurs widely among many groups of living beings. There are thus many kinds of luciferin, such as ﬁ reﬂ y lucif- erin, coelenterazine, bacterial luciferin and so on. All these luciferin compounds typically undergo an enzyme-catalyzed oxidation reaction and emit photons in the visible range, which match well with much PS absorption. Therefore, luciferin is considered as another potential candidate for ILE-PDT. [ 131–133 ] small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 Table 3. A summary of ILE-PDT.

However, the in vivo treatment of viral infections by the PDT concept is largely impeded by the poor penetration depth of illumination light. By utilizing a luciferase/luciferin reaction system as an internal light source, Petrich et al. realized a 10-fold decrease in the viral infec- tivity of equine infectious anemia viruses due to the ROS induced by hypericin without external light irradiation.

Alongside the previously mentioned antivirus effect, luciferin-based ILE-PDT can be applied in tumor therapy as well. After transfection with ﬁ reﬂ y luciferase plasmid DNA, NIH 3T3 cells were co-incu- bated with RB in the presence of luciferin to study the ILE- PDT effect. [ 132 ] Compared to control groups with 100% cell viability, the viability of cells treated with both RB and lucif- erin decreased to 90%. In recent work, Lai et al. made great progress in the employment of ILE-PDT for cancer therapy in vivo ( Figure 18 ).

KGaA, Weinheim small 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 QDs were used as an internal light source. In the presence of coelenterazine, QDs were lighted by the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer progress. The energy from QDs was employed to excite adjacent Foscan drug molecules. Then PDT was pulsed and 1 O 2 generated to eradicate cancer cells. Cell viability in the group treated with a combination of QD-RLuc8 and Foscan-loaded micelles was clearly reduced by increasing the concentration of coelenterazine. After co- injection of Foscan-loaded micelles (0.3 mg kg −1 ), QD-RLuc8 (10 pmol/tumor) and coelenterazine (20 µg), tumor growth rate was dramatically slowed down and the ﬁ nal tumor volume was just half that of the control group. The highlight of this investigation is that QDs are employed as the energy transducer between bioluminescence and PS. As we know, the emission wavelength of QDs is size dependent, which will consequentially endow this novel ILE-PDT system with the ability to excite any clinically approved PS with little change, except for the size of QDs. The external light-independent ILE-PDT system is expected to greatly extend the applications of PDT to deep tissue. It opens a new avenue toward deep tumor therapy although it is still in an incipient stage and more effort should be spent to improve the 1 O 2 generation yield. 6. Future Perspectives and Conclusions PDT is a promising modality in the treatment of cancer because of its intrinsic safety, minimal invasion, high selec- tivity and extensive utilization for peripheral lesions in clinic. When extended to deep-seated tumors inside the body, PDT is greatly hindered by the limited penetration depth of excita- tion light. In this review, we discussed and compared several nanoparticle-based approaches to overcome this problem, including NIR excited PDT, X-ray excited PDT and internal light excited PDT ( Table 4 ). In these approaches, nanopar- ticles serve as nanocarriers for PS loading or antennae for energy transduction to PSs. In some cases, the nanoparticles act as novel PSs that are responsible for 1 O 2 generation and tumor cell damage directly. Moreover, PS loading approaches, energy transfer processes and 1 O 2 generation, as well as bio- logical effects, were addressed in detail. Although, these well- designed therapy modalities discussed here possess massive advantages and have broken through the limitation of tissue penetration depth to some extent, challenges are still on the way. For example, NIR excited PDT is only applicable to tumors seated no more than 1.5-cm deeper under the skin. X-ray and internal light excited PDT suffer from low energy transfer efﬁ ciency and insufﬁ cient 1 O 2 generation, though they have no limitation in tissue penetration depth. Based on the literature focused on the ﬁ eld of deep PDT and the analysis presented here, several conclusions and per- spectives are given as follows: 1) X-ray excitation is deemed to be a fundamental solution to tackle the limited activation depth of excitation light. However, up to now, existing XE-PDT systems are not so effective in terms of 1 O 2 quantum yield, cancer cell destruc- tion efﬁ cacy nor tumor inhibition, especially when com- pared to the complete eradication of tumors in many other investigations based on NIR induced PDT. [ 19a ] Therefore, in order to increase the efﬁ cacy, further efforts are urgently re- quired to design neoteric PSs or ScNP-PS nanocomposites sensitive to radiation with promising applications in vivo. The radioluminescence intensity of ScNPs, energy transfer efﬁ ciency to PS and 1 O 2 generation yield are the main char- acteristics that should be taken into consideration. 2) The oxygen concentration in most solid tumor environ- ments is lower than in normal tissue due to the hyper- metabolic rate of cancer cells, which is another reason that contributes to the unfulﬁ lling effects of PDT in tumor de- struction. Therefore, co-delivery of oxygenic compounds with PSs by nanocarriers may reverse the hypoxic situa- tion to achieve more efﬁ cient therapy. [ 116c ] Moreover, the application of the photosensitive components that are in- dependent of oxygen for cancer cell damage, such as TiO 2 , psoralen and NO release systems, are another avenue to strive for success. [ 116b , 117,135 ] 3) The strategies for deep PDT described here can be extended to the ﬁ eld of deep PTT. Similarly to PDT, PTT is limited by the penetration depth of illumination light, although the light wavelength in most PTT modalities is located in the NIR re- gion. Because of the scattering and absorption of tissue, ex- ternal light that can reach deep tissue is usually insufﬁ cient to generate enough heat to trigger the disruption of cancer cells. Utilizing X-rays as an excitation source can break through the major limitation in light penetration. However, a remaining challenge is still the enhancement of the scintil- lation quantum yield of ScNPs or afterglow nanoparticles. 4) Tumors are malignant lesions with rather a complex physiological microenvironment. Treating tumors with PDT alone is usually not efﬁ cient enough to destroy them completely, as we have reviewed above. Thus, syn- ergetic strategies combining two or more cancer therapy Table 4. A summary of three different deep PDT modalities.

KGaA, Weinheim www.small-journal.comsmall 2015, 11, No. 44, 5860–5887 approaches can launch new prospects, such as the com- bination of PDT and PTT or PDT and chemotherapy. [ 136 ] In practical applications, PDT is often utilized to increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of cancer cells and help elimi- nate residues after tumor excision. Based on this concept, surgery, PDT and chemotherapy can be sequentially inte- grated together for synergetic therapy of tumor. 5) As illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 , most of the relevant pub- lications focus on subcutaneous tumor models. One major reason is that subcutaneous tumor models are easy to be established. However, the microenvironments including blood supply, matrix density and immune microenviron- ment of subcutaneous tumors are very different from or- thotopic tumors. For future translation, extensive investi- gations on orthotopic tumor therapies are urgently desired. Before that, the method to establish orthotopic tumor models should be studied and improved. Another reason for the researchers to choose subcutaneous tumor mod- els is the limited penetration depth of the excitation light (mainly referred to as NIR-triggered PDT). The light can- not pass through epidermal tissue to reach deep-located tumors with enough energy to trigger the PDT effect. To extend PDT application to deep-seated orthotopic tumors, the excitation mode should be improved. For example, mi- crowaves or X-rays can be chosen as the energy source. Overall, in all modalities, the performance of the nanocom- posites should be optimized ﬁ rst and standardized physico- chemical characterization must be established to achieve homogeneous nanocomposites that can yield reproducible therapy efﬁ cacy before future translation. 6) For inorganic nanoparticles used in vivo, one of the major concerns is their potential toxicity. In most studies, in vivo assessments of nanocomposites are conducted through in- tratumoral injection. Although a high tumor inhibition ra- tio can be usually achieved, the systemic side effects of the nanomaterials are barely investigated. Therefore, before future translation, a safety evaluation of the nanomateri- als, including their in vitro immunological and cytotoxic characteristics, in vivo biodistribution and clearance, phar- macokinetic pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) analysis, as well as short-term and long-term effects in vivo,should be sys- tematically investigated and then standardized. In addition, the harm that excitation light does to human tissue and or- gans is another issue should be taken into consideration. Although much effort has been devoted to researching nanocomposite-based deep PDT strategies for tumor therapy, they are still in their elementary stages with ongoing challenges. Nevertheless, we are ﬁ rmly convinced that nano- materials and nanotechnology will play essential roles in eradicating deep tumor tissues, due to important fundamental investigations and inimitable physicochemical characteristics.
