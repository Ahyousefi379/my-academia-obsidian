In this publication we prove that it is possible to kill cancer cells from the inside based on phagocytosed PEM capsules. In addition we show how to open the cells and bring the PEM capsules to the surface of cancer cells based on photothermal eﬀects and rapid evaporation of water. Diﬀusion-based temperature determinations of the photothermal eﬀect up to the evaporation temperature of water are presented. ■ INTRODUCTION Cancer is one of the leading death causes in industrial countries; ﬁghting cancer has therefore a major research topic for decades.1 Heat has been used for tumor therapy since ancient times, and recently modern heat sources such as radiofrequency2,3 and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)4 have been introduced. These modern heating sources allow moderate heating in a speciﬁc target region, which is known as mild hyperthermia.5 The use of lasers shows highly promising probabilities for therapy of cancer close to the surface.6 Commonly in photothermal therapy light absorbing dyes are employed to achieve thermal damage to a targeted tumor.6 Some of the utilized photodynamic dyes in cancer and photodynamic therapies are phtalocyanines which possess high temperature stability and photostability (however absorption maxima usually lie in the visible, rather than in the near-infrared (NIR) region).7,8 Recent advances in the ﬁeld of nanoscience have led to the emergence of noble metal nanostructures such as gold nanorods, caps, and shells with unique photophysical properties.9 These have been considered candidates for photothermal treatment of cancer.10 Noble metal nanoparticles oﬀer phenomena such as surface plasmon resonance and possess therefore strongly enhanced visible and NIR absorption, several orders of magnitude higher compared to conventional phototherapy agents.11 Signiﬁcant endeavors have been devoted to the production of a variety of gold nanostructures, such as nanoparticles12,13 nanoshells,14 nanorods,15 and nanocages, improving the optical properties of gold nanoparticles.16,17 For suﬃcient energy to be generated to damage tumor cells, the size of these nanostructure-based agents is required to be in the range of tens to hundreds of nanometers.18,19 Antibody-assisted aggregation of gold nanoparticles on cell membranes or in intracellular environments led to an enhancement of photo- thermal eﬀects due to the aggregation eﬀects.20,21 Other reported nanostructures are gold shells (i.e., silica cores coated with gold shells) with tunable optical resonance and strong NIR absorption.22 Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM)-based capsules on the contrary are promising candidates for cancer treatment.23,24 The capsule system was originally designed as drug carrier; however, the diﬃculty of a perfect sealing hinders its application as drug carriers until now. It has been shown that by coating gold shells onto PEM capsules, the capsule exhibits typical gold shell resonance wavelengths (800−1200 nm) and photothermal eﬀects.25 Janus particles, as a single entity have distinct surface areas and oﬀer therefore many promising biomedical applications that are not possible with homogeneous particles.26 They can be designed to perform multiplexed biomolecular detection, where one side of a Janus particle is modiﬁed for target recognition, for example, by coating one side with a biomembrane.27 The other side can be functionalized with noble metal nanoparticles to achieve a combination of speciﬁc recognition to cancer cell and photothermal performance. In this study, we investigate photothermal properties of biofunctional Janus capsules and particles, whereby one side is coated with gold nanoparticles and the other side is coated with THP-1 cellular membrane to realize target recognition of cancer cells.28,29 Our focus lies on the monocyte leukemia cell line, THP-1, which displays commitment toward macrophage diﬀerentiation.30 This cell type resembles human monocytes with respect to numerous criteria such as expression of membrane antigens and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Cellular membrane coating allows deﬁned targeting of cancer cells.31 This was shown by our previous study whereby we increased the cancer cell binding property of our system by factor 3 to 7 (depending on cancer cell type) compared to that of Received: December 31, 2015 Revised: March 14, 2016 Article pubs.acs.org/Langmuir © XXXX American Chemical Society A DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04762 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX noncancerous HUVEC cells. 31 This is a big improvement compared to pristine capsules, which showed a cancer cell to healthy cell recognition ability depending on cancer cell type between 1 and 2.31 The diﬀerences in selectivity were attributed to cancer cell surface markers, which allow the THP-1 cellular membrane to discriminate between healthy and nonhealthy cell type (for details see ref 31) The biofunctionalized Janus capsule is used as a photoactive cancer cell detector to kill the cells based on the photothermal eﬀects, rather than using it as a drug delivery system. Viability tests demonstrate that the biofunctionalized Janus capsules co- incubated with HeLa cells for 5 h are phagocytosed32 by the cancer cells and remain in endosomal, lysosomal, or phagosomal compartments of the cell. Upon illumination with NIR-light, the gold shell can be heated, which leads in the case of strong NIR irradiation to violent evaporation of water and to ruptures in the capsule and cellular walls. This ultimately causes cancer cell death. A critical laser power to cause apoptosis of cancer cells is also presented. ■ METHODS AND MATERIALS The silica templates with an average diameter of 5 μm were obtained from Microparticles GmbH, Berlin, Germany. Poly(styrenesulfonate) sodium salt (PSS, Mw = 70 000), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH, Mw = 70 000), methoxy-omega-mercapto-polyethylene glycol (HS- PEG), ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), DID labeling solution [1,1- dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindodicarbocyanineperchlorate], phos- phate buﬀered saline (PBS), (10 mM phosphate buﬀer, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Sodium chloride (NaCl) and hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) were obtained from Chemical Reagent Company, Harbin, China. FITC- modiﬁed PAH (FITC-PAH) was prepared through labeling PAH with FITC according to literature.49 The THP-1 cell line was selected on logarithmic phase and purchased from the Chinese academy of sciences institute for cell resource center, Shanghai, China. All commercial materials were used without further puriﬁcation. Preparation of Janus Capsules. The silica templates were coated with PEM following the well-known LbL procedure according to the literature.33,34 Brieﬂy the particles were immersed into PAH solution (2 g/L, 0.5 M NaCl) for 10 min, following a centrifugation step and three washing steps (30 s each, following a centrifugation step). Subsequently the particles were immersed into PSS solution (2 g/L, 0.5 M NaCl) for 10 min with subsequent repetition of the washing steps. This process leads to a polyelectrolyte bilayer ﬁlm. In this study ﬁve bilayers are used; for this reason this process was repeated ﬁve times to form (PAH/PSS)5 onto the templates. Subsequently the PEM@silica was immersed into PAH solution again to make sure the outside layer was positively charged. The polyelectrolyte deposition sequence on the template was therefore (PAH/PSS)5 PAH. To observe the particles in ﬂuorescence microscopy, one PAH layer was afore labeled with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). During the process of self-assembly, the particle dispersion was cautiously shaken by a shaking robot to avoid particle agglomeration. The Janus structure was prepared by depositing a submonolayer of PEM@silica particles onto a glass substrate and sputtering gold NPs for 2 min, followed by peeling oﬀ the particles from the substrate.35 The silica templates were removed by immersing the particles into 0.3 M HF 24 for 15 min, following three washing steps utilizing centrifugation/water washing. All obtained capsule dispersions were stored at 4 °C in ultrapure water. Modiﬁcation of Particles with THP-1 Human Monocyte Leukemia Cell Membranes. Cell Culture. THP-1 cells were suspended and cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium (Jiayu biological reagent company, Harbin, China) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (complete RPMI) at 37 °Cin an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 70% humidity for 48 h. When the cell density reached 70%−80%, the cells were washed with PBS, then incubated for 15 min with 2 μg/mL DID solution to trace the cell apoptosis. Subsequently the cells were washed with PBS 3 times, then ultrasound was used to dissemble these cells in an ice bath (Sonics Vibra- Cell (Branson, USA) to get the fresh aseptic cell membranes in PBS. Modiﬁcation of Janus Capsules. The gold shells of Janus capsules were ﬁrst modiﬁed with a binary mixture of HS-PEG solution. This approach is very eﬀective in preventing the cell membrane from attaching to the surfaces owing to the increased hydrophilicity of the surface as shown in previous publications.36 The high-surface mobility and steric stabilization eﬀects of the PEG chains in water also lower the extent of cell attachment. This also aﬀects the interaction between cancer cell and Janus capsules.36 The binary mixture enables an eﬃcient modiﬁcation of the Janus capsules. Removing the residual HS-PEG was achieved by washing the capsules with PBS three times. To assemble the cell membranes onto the HS-PEG modiﬁed Janus capsules, they were co-incubated with the fresh cell membrane fragments and shaken together for 1 h. The Janus capsule production is graphically shown in Scheme 1. Characterization. An Olympus BX53 ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was utilized to record the cell status and to observe the coincubation between particles and cells. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, S-5200, Tokyo, Japan) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Agilent, Palo Alto, USA) were used to observe the capsules. For AFM tests, a drop of sample solution was dropped onto a silicon wafer with sequential drying at room temperature overnight. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Tecnai G2 F30 microscope (Tecnai, Tokyo, Japan). Copper grids coated with carbon ﬁlms were used as supports for the sample for TEM. For this a drop of solution with dispersed capsules was dropped onto the grid and dried at room temperature overnight. Fluorescence images were obtained using a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The excitation light wavelengths were 488 and 633 nm, respectively. Temperature Measurements and Photothermal Heating. The temperature was determined by comparing the diﬀusion rate of pristine and Janus microparticles (1 μm) prior to dissolving the core in a home build optical trap. This optical trap comprised an Olympus IX71 inverted optical microscope, 20× APO objective with a 10× APO laser collection objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The camera used was a QI cam B series (Qimaging, Surrey, Canada); the alignment of the objective was performed by combining two TSM-25-2 micropositioning tables to an X−Y alignment stage (Zolix, Beijing, China). The laser power alignment was performed with a Thorlabs S310C detector and a PM100D laser power meter (Thorlabs, Newton, USA). The position detectior was a PDS-196-LC (Octron, Shanghai, China) attached to a NI-6008 (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) readout card. The TEM00 mode laser used was an 80 mW TA from Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co (Shanghai, China). The Ince-Gaussian laser which was used not only for temperature measurement but also for laser-based Janus capsule heating was a MW IR 808 2000 mW laser connected to a ATR-1800 manual laser power control unit (both FS-Optics, Shanghai, Scheme 1. Schematic Illustration for the Production of a HTMJ-Microcapsule as a NIR-Triggered Antitumor Platforma aThe release of a capsule from the cell interior is due to rapid (steam explosion like) evaporation of water due to the photothermal eﬀect. Langmuir Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04762 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX B China). Dynamic viscosity data for diﬀerent water temperatures were obtained from ref 37, which contains a reliable online library of technical data. The diﬀerence in particle diﬀusion rate was compared with pure silicon dioxide, Janus particles as well as simulated particle diﬀusion rate of diﬀerent temperatures, by employing the Stokes−Einstein−Suther- land equation.38,39 Using this approach introduces a small error, due to diﬀerent scattering abilities between the silicon dioxide and the gold cap of pristine and Janus particles. This error is however regarded small compared to temperature changes within the particle due to laser absorption. The Janus capsule-based photothermal heating method is graphically shown in Scheme 1. ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Capsule Structure and Cell Entering Properties. Scanning electron microscopic images (SEM, Figure 1A) and transmission electron microscopic images (TEM, Figure 1B) reveal a successful preparation of (PSS/PAH)5Au polyelectrolyte Janus capsules. Five bilayers of polyelectrolyte multilayers are strong enough to support the Janus hollow structure. As shown in Figure 1 panels A and B, the gold nanoparticle distribution covers half of the particles leading to an asymmetric structure of the capsule. The homogeneous Au NPs have a diameter of about 50 nm (see Figure 1C). As Figure 1D shows, the polyelectrolyte part has been modiﬁed with leucocyte membrane (THP-1 cell line). The cellular membrane looks rough and massy in contrast to the pristine PEM ﬁlm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Figure 1E) show that the gold nanoparticles are distributed on top of the ﬁlm and did not penetrate into the ﬁlm. As UV−vis−NIR absorption spectra in Figure 1F show, the biofunctionalized Janus capsules exhibit a strong NIR absorption peak similar to that in the literature.40 The peak has maximum absorption at ∼800 nm which is beneﬁcial for deep tissue- penetrating NIR treatments. This causes minimal damage to healthy skin and tissue.41,42 As Supporting Information (SI) Figures S1 and S2 show, the gold coating increases the PEMs thickness signiﬁcantly. In addition the capsule membrane seems to increase in mechanical stability upon gold sputtering, since the Janus capsules do not collapse totally upon drying but seem to display a half-moon like shape in AFM investigation, as SI Figure S2 shows. Such a ﬁnding is in agreement with recent mechanical investigations of PEM composite materials, where small gold nanoparticles were found to increase PEM mechanical stability.43 As Figure 1 shows, human THP-1 cell membranes were successfully and irreversibly adsorbed onto the Janus capsules. This result is in agreement with our previous quartz microcrystal Figure 1.

The THP-1 cellular membrane fulﬁlls a cancer cell targeting ability due to surface receptors, Figure 3.

Please note that the dark areas in the images are due to shielding of the cell membrane and FITC ﬂuorescence by the gold nanoshell absorption which is on top of the cells due to facing away from the objective. If the gold shell faces to the ground, ﬂuorescence can be observed. Figure 4. HTMJ capsules which were coincubated with HeLa cells for 5 h and exposed to diﬀerent intensities of NIR.

Results of exposing Janus capsules within cells to diﬀerent NIR intensity: point 1 (13.7 mW); point 2 (19.5 mW); point 3 (23.6 mW); point 4 (30.7 mW); point 5 (33.0 mW); the critical intensity of NIR irradiation is close to 23.6 mW. Scale bar = 25 μm. Langmuir Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04762 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX D therefore HTMJ capsules targeting ability is enhanced between 3 and 7 times compared to pristine Janus particles, for details see ref 36. Such a ﬁnding is in agreement with reports of others.44 The selectivity toward cancer cells stems from ligand−receptor binding and not “appetite of the cancer cells”, as temperature- dependent measurements in reference 36 prove. This unidirec- tional capsule to cell binding and phagocytosis is illustrated in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images in Figure 2. To image the Janus structure of PEM capsules, we labeled the positive polyelectrolyte building block of our PEM capsule (PAH) with FITC. The THP-1 cell membrane was labeled with DID. From the overlap images of FITC, DID, and bright ﬁeld channel we can see that the cell membrane was successfully coating only the polymer side of the capsule. The biofunction- alized side of Janus capsules is more inclined to attach to the cancer cell, while most of the gold nanoparticle shells face away from the cancer cells. Such cancer cell selectivity is also observed for homogeneous macrophage cell membrane-coated mesoporous silica particles.31 Macrophages are the successor cells of THP-1 cells and target cancer cells as well. Such particles showed in animal experiments good drug delivery properties and biocompatibility.31 For this reason we expect our system to exhibit similar biocompatibility. In earlier studies our capsules showed no decrease in cell viability within 24 h, supporting this assumption.36 The THP-1 cell membrane itself is biocompatible and biodegradable, whereby the gold shell and the used synthetic polyelectrolytes are not biodegradable, but biocompatible (PAH is harmless in complexes and PSS is already FDA approved).43,45 It is noted however, that the same kind of structure can be produced using biodegradable polyelectrolytes like poly-L-lysine and dextransul- fate,43 and using biodegradable dyes (e.g., phtalocyanines).7 Such a system can be made fully biodegradable and is intended for future studies of the authors. We additionally used CLSM to illustrate that the biofunction- alized Janus capsules can be taken up by the cancer cells (Figure 3). DID was used as a dye in this investigation. DID is a kind of lipophilic ﬂuorescent dye for labeling membranes and other hydrophobic structures, and is usually used in vital cell staining. Once applied to cells, these dyes diﬀuse laterally within the cellular plasma membranes. To conﬁrm that the cytomembrane of cancer cells reaches out to phagocytose the particles completely, the THP-1 cell membrane was not labeled with DID in this case. The capsules were incubated with DID labeled HeLa cells for 5 h. To trace the Janus capsules within the cells, Figure 5. Changes in X and Y diﬀusion coeﬃcients of pristine and Janus 1 μm-particles when exposing the particles to a laser power of ∼20 mW/μm 2 with a focused elliptical Ince-Gaussian multimode laser. This laser type has the advantage of heating but not trapping the particle in comparison to a TEM00 laser. This mode-dependent diﬀerence was determined by determining the existence of a corner frequency for both laser types (results not shown, frequency measured up to 2.5 kHz). The elliptical laser facilitates slightly uneven diﬀusion values (D). Using diﬀerent laser power values on pristine particles only causes small changes in D until the particles are shot out of focus, while Janus particles could only be measured at this speciﬁc laser power. Lower values were too low for detection with the present system and higher laser powers caused evaporation of water and shooting of the used Janus particles out of focus. Please note that diﬀusion error bars are within symbols and RxSiO2 and RySiO2 are overlapping, due to normalization of values. Figure 6.

The cancer cell apoptosis appeared soon after the Janus capsules within the cells were exposed to NIR irradiation. Scale bar =25 μm.

The inset image in Figure 6D is from a HTMJ capsule before NIR exposure of an embedded Janus capsule, inset scale bar = 3 μm. SI, Video S1 shows the photothermal release of a capsule from the cell interior. Langmuir Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04762 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX E PAH labeled with FITC was used as a PEM building block in this experiment. The sectional axonometric images of 3D CLSM images in Figure 3 show that biofunctionalized Janus capsules are totally wrapped by the red ﬂuorescent cell membrane. This illustrates that the particles have been fully embedded into HeLa cells. They are surrounded by cellular membranes, and therefore not in the cytoplasm, but within endosomal, lysosomal, or phagosomal compartments of the cells. The phagocytosis intermediate state is shown in Figure 3D, which displays a half swallowed state. Figure 3E shows a sectional axonometric display of HeLa cells containing Janus capsules. The red color stems from the HeLa cell membrane that extends over the modiﬁed side of Janus capsule, which is in agreement with previous reports44 on the endocytosis pathway of Janus microparticles. Photothermal Properties and Biocompatibility. Illumi- nating the Janus capsules with a NIR laser causes a strong local heating which is commonly observed in nanoparticle systems with selective excitation of photoactive centers.6 The heating of metal particles such as gold nanoparticles has been used in previous biomedical applications.46−48 Damage of cells close to the particles is caused by the strong heat of the particle. Also localized explosive boiling of water as well as cell culture media was observed. Cell disintegration was achieved via explosive water evaporation as well as due to the high temperature, similar to that in refs 43 and 49. The photothermal cancer treatment relies on temperature-based cell membrane permeation and protein structure changes. The hollow Janus capsules form theoretically should allow additional drug delivery and thermophoretic motion as well as nudging as discussed in refs 50 and 51. It is noted that thermophoretic motion of free swimming capsules upon laser irradiation was observed as well (data not shown). The THP-1 cell membrane-modiﬁed Janus capsules displayed good biocompatibility (no decrease in cell viability within 24 h) and improved cellular uptake compared to pristine capsules. The cells stay viable until laser irradiation-based temperature increases lead to cell death. The temperature increase was achieved by using laser diodes with wavelengths located in the biologically friendly near-infrared part of the spectrum.52 After the THP-1 cell modiﬁed Janus capsules were coincubated with HeLa cell for 5 h, they were exposed to laser irradiation at a wavelength of 808 nm with power densities ranging from 13.7 to 33 mW/μm2 for 5 s. The cells were then stained with propidium iodide (PI) to characterize cell viability. As shown in Figure 4, the gold shell of the Janus capsule introduces a photothermal eﬀect which can be used to destroy cancer cells. The critical laser density for irreversible cell destruction was found to be close to 23.6 mW/μm2 (Figure 4 point 3). Optical trap-based diﬀusion measurements of 1 μm sized pristine and Janus particles (particles were used due to optical properties only in this experiment) were performed to determine the Janus capsule and particle temperature of this laser density. This laser density correlates to a temperature of 70−90 °C on the fully gold-coated side of the Janus capsule, while the half-coated sides reach 40−45 °C due to a thinner gold layer and incomplete coating. The diﬀusion values for diﬀerent temperatures are shown in Figure 5. The cell killing eﬀect is therefore most likely caused by temperature-based protein denaturation and coagu- lation as well as cell membrane destruction. It is additionally noted, that optical trapping of nongold-coated silicon particles up to 50 mW did not shoot the particles out of focus and only small changes in D were detected. The observed diﬀerences in D values are therefore considered to be temperature-induced. The propidium iodide (PI) dye molecule is able to cross the broken cell membrane, arriving in the cell nucleus showing a red color in ﬂuorescence microscope. A living cell exposed to a laser intensity below the threshold (Figure 4 points 1 and 2) shows good viability indicating Janus capsules themselves and laser irradiation below the threshold were not cytotoxic. Laser intensity above the threshold resulted in killing of cancer cells, (Figure 4 points 4 and 5) but also damage of cells surrounding the cancer cell. The usefulness of IR irradiation absorbing gold shells for photothermal cancer therapy is increased by the targeting function of the THP-1 cell membrane, which facilitates attachment to cancer cells, which is in agreement with the literature.53 With the use of a short-term, strong laser pulse (1 s duration, >23.6 mW/μmSiO2 with high increase in intensity rate), the Figure 7.

Images A to E taken from SI, Video S2. Langmuir Article DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04762 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX−XXX F phagocytosed capsule can be shot out of the cancer cell. This eﬀect can be clearly observed by comparing image A, B, and D in Figure 6, with crater like structures remaining on the cells as shown in SI, Figure S3. It is noted that in the majority of explosive photothermal treatments and capsule freeing attempts, the capsule integrity also suﬀers, as Figure S3 shows. For larger tumor areas with a high number of attached Janus capsules, large deﬁned areas can be literally roasted using NIR irradiation. This eﬀect, which is shown in Figure 7 is due to the strong local heating, especially when several Janus capsules agglomerate within the area of the laser focus. ■ CONCLUSION We developed a hyperthermia system for photothermal cancer cell destruction. Instead of applying individual gold nanoparticles that can absorb NIR light, the particles are sputtered onto Janus capsules becoming a gold shell that provides a stable frame. The biofunctionalization of the free PEM part allows the capsule to selectively target cancer cells. The biofunctional capsule is prepared by the well-known LbL assembly procedure. UV−vis− NIR absorption spectra of the gold shell coating on the PEM capsule show an absorption maximum in the near-infrared region. Leucocyte cell membrane was used to modify the Janus capsules to achieve better biocompatibility and target recog- nition. In vitro experiments of biofunctionalized Janus capsules prove that it can be phagocytosed by cancer cells. If exposed to NIR laser it can successfully kill cancer cells. A laser power density of 23.6 mW/μm 2 was found to be suﬃcient to kill cancer cells. A short-term laser pulse above this value was found to be able to explosively evaporate water and to shoot the particles out of the cell. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT *S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.lang- muir.5b04762.
