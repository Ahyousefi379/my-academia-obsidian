Here we report the rational design of a Hf− porphyrin nanoscale metal−organic framework, DBP− UiO, as an exceptionally eﬀective photosensitizer for PDT of resistant head and neck cancer. DBP−UiO eﬃciently generates 1O2 owing to site isolation of porphyrin ligands, enhanced intersystem crossing by heavy Hf centers, and facile 1O2 diﬀusion through porous DBP−UiO nanoplates. Consequently, DBP−UiO displayed greatly enhanced PDT eﬃcacy both in vitro and in vivo, leading to complete tumor eradication in half of the mice receiving a single DBP−UiO dose and a single light exposure. NMOFs thus represent a new class of highly potent PDT agents and hold great promise in treating resistant cancers in the clinic. P hotodynamic therapy (PDT) is a phototherapy that combines three nontoxic components, a photosensitizer (PS), a light source, and tissue oxygen, to cause toxicity to malignant and other diseased cells.1 The mechanism of PDT involves energy transfer from the light-excited PS to oxygen and other molecules in the tissue to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly, singlet oxygen (1O2), which induces cellular toxicity.1,2 PDT can lead to localized destruction of diseased tissues via selective uptake of the PS and/or local exposure to light, providing a minimally invasive cancer therapy. The application of PDT in cancer treatment dates back to 1970s when hematoporphyrin derivatives were studied for PDT eﬃcacy in vivo,1 and the ﬁrst PDT agent photofrin was approved for clinical use in 1993. Most clinically used PSs are from the porphyrin family, with a few other dyes emerging as eﬃcient PSs in recent years.3 Selective localization of PSs in tumors is critical for eﬀective PDT. However, many PSs are hydrophobic in nature, which not only leads to insuﬃcient tumor localization but also causes PS aggregation to diminish the PDT eﬃcacy.4 Signiﬁcant synthetic modiﬁcations are thus needed to render these PSs eﬀective PDT agents in vivo. An alternative approach is to use nanocarriers to selectively deliver therapeutic or PDT agents to tumors via the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) eﬀect and some times via active tumor targeting with ligands that bind to overexpressed receptors in cancers.4,5 Indeed, a number of nanoparticle platforms have been developed to deliver molecule- or material-based PDT and photothermal agents to cancers; and in some cases, encouraging clinical data are emerging.6 Nanoscale metal−organic frameworks (NMOFs), constructed from metal ion/ion clusters and organic bridging ligands, have recently emerged as a promising nanocarrier platform for therapeutic and imaging agents.7 Compared to other nano- carriers, NMOFs combine many beneﬁcial features into a single delivery platform, including tunable chemical compositions and crystalline structures; high porosity; and biodegradability. For example, we used a NMOF to deliver both cisplatin (in the pores) and siRNAs (on the surface) to overcome drug resistance in ovarian cancer,7j and more recently, we demonstrated real- time intracellular pH sensing in live cells with a ﬂuorescent NMOF by taking advantage of its crystalline and porous structure.8 Here we report the design of a Hf−porphyrin NMOF as a highly eﬀective PS for PDT of resistant head and neck cancer. Although porphyrin-based MOFs have been intensively studied,9 the delivery of PDT agents using porphyrin-based NMOFs has not been realized. We hypothesized that the incorporation of a porphyrin-derived bridging ligand into a robust and porous UiO NMOF structure with proper morphologies and dimensions would have several advantages over existing nanoparticle PDT agents: ﬁrst, the PS molecules are well-isolated in the framework to avoid aggregation and self-quenching of the excited states; second, coordination of porphyrin ligands to heavy Hf centers via the carboxylate groups can promote intersystem crossing to enhance ROS generation eﬃciency; third, the porous NMOF structure provides a pathway for facile diﬀusion of ROS (such as 1O2) out of the NMOF interior to exert their cytotoxic eﬀects on cancer cells. In this NMOF design, an unprecedentedly high PS loading can be achieved to enable highly eﬀective PDT of diﬃcult-to-treat cancers. The new porphyrin derivative, 5,15-di(p-benzoato)porphyrin (H2DBP), was synthesized by a condensation reaction between 4-(methoxycarbonyl)benzaldehyde and dipyrrylmethane, and characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (Figures S3−S5, Supporting Information [SI]). The linearly aligned dicarboxylate groups of the DBP ligand allow the construction of a DBP−UiO NMOF with the framework formula of Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(DBP)6.DBP− UiO was synthesized by a solvothermal reaction between HfCl4 and H2DBP in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 80 °C (Scheme 1). The resulting dark purple powder was washed with copious amounts of DMF, 1% triethylamine in ethanol (v/ Received: August 22, 2014 Published: November 19, 2014 Communication pubs.acs.org/JACS © 2014 American Chemical Society 16712 dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja508679h | J.

Numerous attempts failed to grow DBP−UiO crystals suitable for single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction. Fortunately, we have determined the single crystal structure of an analogue of DBP−UiO, Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(Zn−DPDBP)6 (Zn− DPDBP−UiO, DPDBP is 5,15-di(p-benzoato)-10,20-diphenyl- porphyrin and has the same length as DBP; Table S1 and Figure S6, SI), whose powder X-ray diﬀraction (PXRD) pattern is essentially the same as that of DBP−UiO (Figure 1a). DBP−UiO thus adopts a UiO-type MOF structure that is built from 12- connected Hf6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4 secondary building units (SBUs) and DBP bridging ligands.10 DBP−UiO has a very open framework structure with triangular channels of 1.6 nm in dimensions as well as octahedral and tetrahedral cavities of 2.8 and 2.0 nm in dimensions, respectively. DBP−UiO particles display a plate morphology by trans- mission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1b and Figure S7, SI). Nitrogen adsorption measurements gave a BET surface area of 558 m 2/g for DBP−UiO (Figure S8, SI). The composition of DBP−UiO was conﬁrmed by thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S9, SI) and inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (ICP−MS), giving DBP loading of 77 wt % (calcd 73%) and Hf content of 24.3% (calcd 23.7%), respectively. These results also indicate that DBP ligands do not coordinate to Hf 4+ ions via nitrogen atoms during the UiO synthesis (the Hf content would have been 37.2% if all DBP ligands were metalated). Individual SBUs are clearly visible in high-resolution TEM images of DBP−UiO (Figure 1c). The distances between SBUs are measured to be approximately 2.7 nm (Figure S10, SI), which are consistent with the calculated distances of 2.77 nm based on the X-ray structure model. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the high-resolution TEM image displays a 3-fold symmetry for the nanoplates (Figure 1d), consistent with the cubic crystal system of the DBP−UiO. The dimensions of the nanoplates are measured to be ∼100 nm in diameter and ∼10 nm in thickness. Such thin plates consist of only 4−5 sets of (111) packing layer (d111 = 2.2 nm). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements gave an average diameter of 76.3 nm for the particles (Figure S11, SI). Notably, the nanoplate morphology is particularly advanta- geous for generating ROS for PDT. The diﬀusion length of 1O2 is no more than 90−120 nm in aqueous environment11 and was estimated to be 20−220 nm inside cells. 12 Therefore, the nanoplates as thin as 10 nm in thickness are ideally suited for transporting 1O2 from the NMOF interior to the cell cytoplasm to exert cytotoxic eﬀects. The UiO framework was recently shown to be stable in aqueous solution.7j,10 DBP−UiO was incubated in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium for 12 h to determine its stability in physiologically relevant media. TEM images showed an unaltered morphology of the nanoplates, and FFT proved that the crystalline structure of DBP−UiO remained intact (Figures 1e,f and S12, SI). The PXRD patterns of the NMOF samples before and after incubation in RPMI 1640 medium are identical (Figure 1a), further conﬁrming structural stability of DBP−UiO in physiological environments. The UV−visible absorption spectra of H2DBP and DBP−UiO in phosphate buﬀer saline (PBS) buﬀers (pH = 7.4) are compared in Figure 2a. H2DBP shows a Soret band at 402 nm and four Q-bands at 505, 540, 566, and 619 nm. The extinction coeﬃcients of H2DBP at 402 and 619 nm are 2.2 × 10 5 and 1.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1, respectively (Figures S13 and 14, SI). DBP−UiO shows slight red shifts for all Q-bands, with the peaks appearing at 510, 544, 579, and 634 nm. The red-shifts probably result from the coordination of the carboxylate groups of DBP ligands to Hf4+ centers. The presence of four Q-bands and their red shifts further support the presence of free-base porphyrin ligands in DBP−UiO. The Soret band of DBP−UiO is signiﬁcantly broadened, presumably due to inequivalent ligand environments in thin nanoplates as well as potential framework distortion in thin MOF structures. Singlet oxygen generation eﬃciencies of H2DBP and DBP− UiO were determined using Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green (SOSG, Life Technologies). After exposure to a LED light source (peak emission at 640 nm and energy irradiance of 100 mW/ Scheme 1.

Journal of the American Chemical Society Communication dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja508679h | J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014, 136, 16712−1671516713 cm2; Figure S17, SI), the chemiluminescent reagent SOSG reacted with 1O2 to generate green ﬂuorescence, which was quantiﬁed with a ﬂuorimeter. The ﬂuorescence intensity was plotted against irradiation time (Figure 2b). The 1O2 generation was depicted with an exponential function that corresponded to a pseudo ﬁrst-order process. The 1O2 generation curve was ﬁtted with the following equation: =− −I A(1 e ) kt F (1) where IF is ﬂuorescence intensity and t represents irradiation time, while A and k are ﬁtting parameters (for detailed derivations, see SI). The ﬁtted equations for H2DBP and DBP−UiO are (Table S3, SI) =× − −I 68 (1 e ) t H2DBP 0.0015 (2) =× −− −I 88 (1 e ) t DBP UiO 0.0033 (3) The product of Ak in the equation is proportional to the initial rate of the reaction that indicates the 1O2 generation eﬃciency (see discussion in SI). DBP−UiO is thus at least twice as eﬃcient as H2DBP in generating 1O2, presumably owing to heavy Hf4+ centers facilitating the intersystem crossing from the 1DBP to 3DBP excite state.13 Consistent with this, the 1DBP emission intensity at 640 nm greatly diminished for DBP−UiO (by a factor of ∼250; Figure S15, SI) with a lifetime reduction from 10.9 ns for H2DBP to 0.26 ns for DBP−UiO (Figures 2c and S16 and Table S2, SI). As a control, addition of Hf4+ to the H2DBP ligand solution did not enhance but rather reduce the generation of 1O2 (Figure 2b). Encouraged by the excellent 1O2 generation eﬃciency, we tested the PDT eﬃcacy of DBP−UiO on resistant head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer refers to a group of biologically similar cancers that arise in the head or neck region (including nasal cavity, sinuses, lips, mouth, salivary glands, throat, and larynx). Current treatments of head and neck cancers include surgery and radiation therapy, with chemotherapy and chemo- radiotherapy playing some roles. 14 Since head and neck cancers occur superﬁcially, PDT represents a viable alternative treatment modality.15 In vitro PDT was performed on human head and neck cancer cells SQ20B, which are resistant to cisplatin and radiation therapy. The tumor cell uptake of DBP−UiO was ﬁrst evaluated by incubating SQ20B cells with DBP−UiO (30 μg/mL) for 4 or 12 h (Figure S20, SI). The Hf concentrations in the cells were determined by ICP−MS. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was observed between the cells after 4 and 12 h incubations, showing rapid internalization of DBP−UiO by cancer cells. To further conﬁrm the PDT eﬃcacy of DBP−UiO, SQ20B cancer cells were treated with H2DBP, DBP−UiO, or protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) at various concentrations (5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μM based on ligand concentrations), and the cells were irradiated with LED light (640 nm, 100 mW/cm 2) for 15 min (total light dose 90 J/cm2) or 30 min (total light dose 180 J/ cm2), respectively. Signiﬁcant PDT eﬃcacy was observed in DBP−UiO treated groups, even for the group receiving 5 μMPS dose and 15 min irradiation (Figure 2d). H2DBP-treated groups show moderate PDT eﬃcacy only at 20 μM dose with 30 min light irradiation, while no cytotoxicity was observed in dark control or blank control groups. In comparison, PpIX is much less photocytotoxic than DBP−UiO under similar conditions (Figure 2d). We carried out proof-of-concept in vivo experiments on SQ20B subcutaneous xenograft murine models to evaluate the PDT eﬃcacy of DBP−UiO. The mice were treated with PBS control, DBP−UiO (3.5 mg DBP/kg), or H2DBP (3.5 mg/kg) by intratumoral injection. Twelve hours post injection, each mouse was irradiated at the tumor site with light (180 J/cm2) for 30 min. For comparison, photofrin is administrated by intraperitoneal injection at 10 mg/kg in tumor bearing mice and with light irradiation of 135 J/cm2.16 As depicted in Figure 3a, the tumors of mice treated with DBP−UiO started shrinking 1day post DBP−UiO administration and PDT. Most importantly, among the four tumors in the DBP−UiO group, two tumors were completely eradicated by single DBP−UiO administration and single light irradiation, while the sizes of the Figure 2.

The tumor growth of mice treated with H2DBP was slightly suppressed after PDT, however, accelerated after 5 days and exhibited no diﬀerence to the control group at the end point. After local administration, DBP−UiO could be eﬃciently internalized by the tumor cells and induce cytotoxicity upon irradiation, while the free ligand might be cleared away from the tumor sites before irradiation. No skin/tissue damage was observed after PDT treatment on all mice (Figure 3c). Histologies of tumor slices showed macrophage inﬁltration in tumors of the DBP−UiO treated group and indicated that signiﬁcant fractions of tumor cells were undergoing apoptosis/ necrosis (Figure S21, SI). In summary, we have designed and synthesized a stable and porous DBP−UiO NMOF with an ideal combination of structural regularity and nanoplate morphology for highly eﬀective PDT of resistant head and neck cancer. As a result of site isolation of DBP ligands, enhanced intersystem crossing by Hf clusters, and facile 1O2 diﬀusion out of a porous nanoplate, the NMOF works as an eﬃcient PDT photosensitizer, as demonstrated by both 1O2 generation eﬃciency measurements and in vitro cytotoxicity assays. In vivo PDT eﬃcacy studies with subcutaneous xenograft murine models demonstrated 50 times tumor volume reduction in half of the mice and complete tumor eradication in the other half of the mice that were treated with DBP−UiO. In comparison, no therapeutic eﬀect was observed in themicetreated with H2DBP. The facile structural and compositional tunability of NMOFs should allow further tuning of other properties to aﬀord a new generation of highly potent PDT agents for treating resistant cancers in the clinic. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT *S Supporting Information Experimental details for the synthesis and characterization of H2DBP, DBP−UiO, and Zn−DPDBP−UiO, photochemical properties and singlet oxygen generation, cellular uptake, and in vitro and in vivo eﬃcacy studies.
