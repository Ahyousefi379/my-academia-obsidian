This is not the case for solutions based on minimum-norm estimates. In the present study, we evaluated the spatial accuracy of the L2 minimum-norm estimate (MNE) in realistic noise conditions by assessing its ability to localize sources of evoked responses at the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Methods: Multichannel somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and magnetic ﬁelds (SEFs) were recorded in 5 subjects while stimulating the median and ulnar nerves at the left wrist. A Tikhonov-regularized L2-MNE, constructed on a spherical surface from the SEP signals, was compared with an equivalent current dipole (ECD) solution obtained from the SEFs. Results: Primarily tangential current sources accounted for both SEP and SEF distributions at around 20 ms (N20/N20m) and 70 ms (P70/P70m), which deﬂections were chosen for comparative analysis. The distances between the locations of the maximum current densities obtained from MNE and the locations of ECDs were on the average 12 – 13 mm for both deﬂections and nerves stimulated. In accordance with the somatotopical order of SI, both the MNE and ECD tended to localize median nerve activation more laterally than ulnar nerve activation for the N20/N20m deﬂection. Simulation experiments further indicated that, with a proper estimate of the source depth and with a good ﬁt of the head model, the MNE can reach a mean accuracy of 5 mm in 0.2-mV root-mean-square noise. Conclusions: When compared with previously reported localizations based on dipole modelling of SEPs, it appears that equally accurate localization of S1 can be obtained with the MNE. Signiﬁcance: MNE can be used to verify parametric source modelling results. Having a relatively good localization accuracy and requiring minimal assumptions, the MNE may be useful for the localization of poorly known activity distributions and for tracking activity changes between brain areas as a function of time. q 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Introduction The task to reconstruct the current distribution under- lying a measured electric or magnetic ﬁeld outside the source volume is called the electromagnetic inverse problem. No unique solution exists, because a large number of source conﬁgurations is invisible to measurement sensors. This means that many current combinations may produce an identical ﬁeld outside the source volume (cf. Ilmoniemi, 1991). The most common approach for solving the problem is the use of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs), each active brain region being modeled with at least one point-like dipole, which may be ﬁxed in position and orientation. This approach is best suited for cases where it can be assumed that neuronal activity is localized into a small number of distinct areas of the brain. Instead of point-like sources, some inverse algorithms search for the best estimate of a distributed primary current.

In minimum-norm algorithms, the solution with the smallest norm is selected from all those current distributions that could explain the measured potential or magnetic ﬁeld. Requiring no a priori assumptions about the nature of the source current distribution, minimum-norm estimation (MNE) may be the best choice when the activity distribution is poorly known in advance. The MNE can be formulated in different ways (Ha¨ma¨la¨inen and Ilmoniemi, 1984, 1994; Matsuura and Okabe, 1995; Pascual-Marqui et al., 1994; Sarvas, 1987). L2-norm solutions minimize the energy (integral of squared current density) of source currents, whereas L1-norm solutions minimize the integral of the absolute value of the source current (Matsuura and Okabe, 1995; Uutela et al., 1999). Generally, the L1 solution tends to yield more focal sources, while the L2 solution may more accurately describe distributed sources. One drawback of the L1 MNE is that its present practical solutions require prior information about current orientations, which may cause error when unknown source-current distributions are esti- mated. Also, the computational load is considerably higher when using the L1 norm. In realistic noise conditions, the spatial resolution of the L2 norm may even be comparable to that of the L1 norm (Fuchs et al., 1999). The L2 MNE has been applied to several types of bioelectric and -magnetic inverse problems, such as source localization of event-related potentials and magnetic ﬁelds (Ahlfors et al., 1992; Babiloni et al., 2000; Dobel et al., 1998; Haan et al., 2000; Rinne et al., 2000; Shibata and Ioannides, 2001), multichannel magnetocardiograms (Leder et al., 1998; Numminen et al., 1995), potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (Ilmoniemi et al., 1997; Komssi et al., 2002), and epileptic foci (Fuchs et al., 1999). However, few studies have attempted to validate the MNE localization accuracy against dipole modelling in a situation with well-characterized current sources. In the present study, we therefore wanted to evaluate the L2-norm localizations of current sources at the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), activated by median and ulnar nerve stimulation. We compared the L2-norm solutions with source localizations obtained by applying ECD modelling to somatosensory evoked magnetic ﬁelds (SEFs), as the latter method has proven to provide accurate localization of the S1 hand area (Baumgartner et al., 1991; Hari et al., 1996; Hoshiyama et al., 1996). We further tested whether the L2-norm solutions could distinguish the closely located sources activated by the two nerves. Finally, with simulation experiments, we evaluated the inﬂuence of source depth and measurement noise on the MNE localization accuracy. 2. Methods 2.1. Computation of the MNE Any current conﬁguration can be considered a vector in a linear current space indexed by all points of a 3-dimensional source space and by 3 orthogonal directions at each point. Those currents that contribute to a measured electroenceph- alogram (EEG) lie in the subspace spanned by the lead ﬁelds L of the N electrode derivations (e.g., pairs formed by scalp electrodes and the reference electrode). The current estimate ^J is in this subspace and can be written in the form ^J ¼ wTL; ð1Þ where L ¼ [L1, L2,…, LN ]T; w ¼ [w1,w2,…, wN ]T represents the weighting factors which are calculated on the basis of the measurement. Each EEG signal Vi provides a projection of the current vector on the lead ﬁeld of the electrode derivation and is written as the inner product of the lead ﬁeld and the primary current J p (Ha¨ma¨la¨inen and Ilmoniemi, 1994): Vi ¼ Li; Jp hi: ð2Þ By inserting the current estimate from Eq. (1) to (2), we get a group of equations V ¼ Kw ) w ¼ K21V; ð3Þ where K is an N £ N matrix containing the inner products of the lead ﬁelds. If K is singular, as it may be in practical measurement set-ups, its inverse does not exist, but a more general pseudoinverse K* ¼ (K TK) –1K T can be calculated using the singular-value decomposition. In the Tikhonov- regularized pseudoinverse Kreg*, K TK is replaced with an approximating matrix K TK þ aI (a . 0) to stabilize the solution (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977). The regularized MNE is ﬁnally ^J ¼ðKp regVÞTL: ð4Þ 2.2. EEG and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recording, magnetic resonance imaging Two males (22 and 36 years) and 3 females (27, 27, and 31 years) volunteered for the study, which was approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Radiology, Helsinki University Central Hospital. The subjects were ﬁrst imaged with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner (Magnetom Vision, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). A 3D magnetization-prepared rapid- gradient-echo sequence was used for imaging the whole head (180 sagittal slices with 1-mm thickness without gap, TR ¼ 9.7 ms, TE ¼ 4 ms, TI ¼ 20 ms, ﬂip angle 12 degrees, FOV 256 mm, matrix size 256 £ 256). SEFs were recorded with a 306-channel whole-head array consisting of 102 magnetometers and 204 planar gradiometers (VectorView, Elekta Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were simultaneously measured with a 60-channel electrode cap (Virtanen et al., 1996), with an interelectrode spacing of about 34 mm in the anteroposterior and 41 mm in S. Komssi et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 115 (2004) 534–542 535 the mediolateral direction. The reference electrode was at the nose. The positions of the electrodes, the preauricular points, and the nasion were determined individually with a 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA) before the recording. The median and ulnar nerves at the left wrist were alternately stimulated with rectangular current pulses (duration 0.2 ms) at an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 200 ms. A short ISI was chosen to enable averaging a large number of sweeps in a relatively short period of time, and thus ensuring a good signal-to-noise ratio. Stimulus intensities were adjusted individually so that a clear twitch was seen in the abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi muscles. Horizontal and vertical electro-oculograms were recorded. The EEG and MEG signals were bandpass ﬁltered between 1 and 330 Hz and sampled at 1002 Hz. Sweeps containing MEG amplitudes higher than 3 pT/cm or electro-ocular or muscle artifacts exceeding 150 mV were rejected online. For both nerves, 2000 artifact-free epochs from 50 ms pre- to 100 ms poststimulus were averaged. During the measurement, the subject sat comfortably in a magnetically shielded room, with eyes closed and the head supported with pillows to avoid head movements or muscle tension at the neck. 2.3. EEG and MEG data analysis A digital ﬁnite-impulse-response ﬁlter was applied to the averaged SEPs, with a passband of 10– 100 Hz, and to the SEFs with an individually selected bandwidth with a passband of at least 25 – 330 Hz. For each subject, the EEG noise level was estimated from the signals by calculating the root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the 50-ms prestimulus period. For constructing the MNE on the basis of the SEPs, we used a spherical volume conductor as the head model, with 4 concentric layers having homogeneous and isotropic conductivities (scalp: thickness a ¼ 4 mm, conductivity s ¼ 0.33 m 21 V 21; skull: a ¼ 6 mm, s ¼ 0.0042 m21 V21; cerebrospinal ﬂuid: a ¼ 2 mm, s ¼ 1.0 m 21 V21; and brain: s ¼ 0.33 m21 V21; Peters and de Munck, 1990). The outermost sphere (scalp) was ﬁtted to the individual electrode locations, using the least-squares algorithm. After ﬁtting, the electrode locations were projected to the sphere surface (scalp). An individual Cartesian coordinate system was initially deﬁned for each subject so that the x- axis pointed from left to right along the line connecting the preauricular points, the y-axis anteriorly through the nasion, and the z-axis upwards. The origin of the coordinate system was then transferred without rotation to the center of the individual head model; the source locations were expressed in this frame. The MNE solution was computed on a spherical surface using Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977). The regularization parameter of 10 –5 was chosen, because it was found to result in a reasonable solution as a compromise between dispersion of the source and noise effects. Because sources at S1 usually lie at the depth of 2– 4 cm below the scalp, the average being approximately at 3 cm (Buchner et al., 1995; Rossini et al., 1989; Sutherling et al., 1988), the MNE computation surface was placed 32 mm below the outermost (20 mm below the innermost) sphere surface. The surface consisted of 4096 square grid cells, each of them being occupied by 3 dipole components in orthogonal directions. For the estimation of 3-dimen- sional current density, the grid cells were ascribed a depth of 5 mm. This thickness was chosen to represent the part of the sulcal wall that extends below the computation layer. The MNE was calculated in 1-ms steps from 0 to 100 ms poststimulus. The position and strength of each current- density maximum was registered; these positions were used to denote the site of maximum activation, and compared with the ECD locations. In MEG, dipolar ﬁeld patterns were searched around the contralateral S1 (S1c) during 0 –100 ms poststimulus, and, when found, an ECD was ﬁtted to a subset of 22 gradiometer signals containing both extrema of the ﬁeld pattern. The ﬁtting was performed sequentially, covering 10 ms around the peaking of the dipolar ﬁeld, and the source was determined by selecting the strongest dipole with a good- ness-of-ﬁt value over 80%. The innermost sphere of the 4- layer model for the MNE computation was also used as the head model for localizing the ECDs. This was done to exclude the inﬂuence of the head model on the differences between the MNE and ECD localizations. The ECD and MNE localizations were visualized by inserting the sources into the frame of an individual anatomical 3D MRI set. The co-registration of the source positions and anatomical structures was performed indivi- dually based on the coordinates of the preauricular points and the nasion. Because the ECDs ﬁtted to SEFs were chosen as reference to which the MNEs were compared, we concentrated on the mainly tangential components of the somatosensory responses. With the presently used ISI and ﬁlter setting, these occurred at 20 ms (N20/N20m) and approximately 70 ms (P70/P70m) poststimulus. At latencies between 25 and 55 ms, a mixture of tangential and radial currents was active, and this period was not analyzed in detail. 2.4. Computational analysis In the simulations (performed with MATLAB; The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), the MNE was constructed for a 20-nAm tangential dipole at 3 different locations and 8 different orientations at each location. Regularization parameters 1026,1025,1024, and 1023 were used. The inﬂuence of source depth deviating from the depth of the MNE computation surface was tested with a dipole at the depths of 0, 3, 10, and 20 mm below the computation surface. The simulations were carried out in a noiseless S. Komssi et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 115 (2004) 534–542536 situation and with spatially uncorrelated noise added to the potentials. If the outer sphere of the head model does not estimate the head shape adequately, i.e. the ﬁtted electrode locations deviate much from their original sites, the localization is not accurate. The inﬂuence of the shifts of the electrode positions on the MNE localization accuracy was tested with one simulated dipole at 6 different locations at the surface of the innermost sphere (brain). The potential of each dipole was calculated at the digitized electrode positions of Subject 1, and the MNE was constructed after ﬁtting the electrodes to the outermost sphere of the head model. The MNE localization was then compared with the original dipole location. 3. Results 3.1. SEP and SEF waveforms and spatial distributions Fig. 1 shows SEPs and SEFs to left median nerve stimulation for Subject 5. The SEPs evoked by stimulation of both median and ulnar nerves consisted of parietal N20- P27-N60-P70 and frontal P20-N27-P60-N70 deﬂections, which were associated with dipolar ﬁeld patterns reversing polarity near the central sulcus over the S1c hand area. In addition, central N35 (n ¼ 2) and P45 deﬂections without polarity reversals and a single potential maximum over S1c were identiﬁed. Because these deﬂections dominated usually at 25– 55 ms, clearly dipolar distributions with polarity reversal over S1c were conﬁned to the N20 and P70 deﬂections; these were therefore taken to represent primarily tangential current sources at S1c. The MNE solutions showed distinct peaks in the current density values at 22, 27, 40, 48, and 67 ms poststimulus, corresponding to the N20, P27, N35, P45, and P70 deﬂections, respectively. Fig. 2 illustrates the potential maps and the MNEs at the peak latencies for Subject 1. The sulcal source-estimate current densities were 0.51 –2.68 mA/m2 (Table 1). The SEFs consisted of 5 sequentially activated ﬁeld patterns, peaking on the average at 21, 27, 35, 52 and 67 ms poststimulus. Each of these peaks showed a dipolar ﬁeld distribution with a tangential ECD at the S1c area. Coincident tangential patterns in both MEG and EEG occurred thus at around 20 ms and around 70 ms; we designate the corresponding deﬂections N20/N20m and P70/P70m, respectively. These were chosen for compari- sons between MNE and ECD source localizations. The distances between the MNE and ECD localiz- ations were 12 ^ 4 (median nerve; range 8– 18 mm) and 13 ^ 6 mm (ulnar nerve; range 8 – 21 mm), for the N20/N20m deﬂection, and 13 ^ 5 (median nerve; range 9 –22 mm) and 13 ^ 5 mm (ulnar nerve; range 5 – 17 mm), for the P70/P70m deﬂection. In the anatomic Fig. 1. Simultaneously recorded SEPs (left; 3 noisy channels are not shown) and SEFs (right; only gradiometer signals are shown) following left median nerve stimulation in Subject 5. The maximum signals over the right S1are shown enlarged. S. Komssi et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 115 (2004) 534–542 537 MRIs, the MNE sources fell within an area between the pre- and postcentral sulcus. Fig. 3 visualizes the source localizations with respect to the individual anatomy in Subject 1. There was a slight systematic mediolateral difference (mean 4 mm) between the ECD and MNE locations so that the ECDs were more laterally located than the MNEs (t test: P ¼ 0:02; see mean source locations in Fig. 4). The ECD localized the sources approximately to the depth of the MNE computation surface (t test: P . 0:05); the absolute difference between the depth of the MNE and ECD sources was, however, 6 ^ 1 mm. If the depth differences were omitted, the distances between corresponding MNEs and ECDs were reduced by 2– 3 mm. Fig. 4 illustrates the individual source positions for the N20/N20m and P70/P70m deﬂections in the mediolateral (x) and anteroposterior (y) directions. It is seen that, with the ECD, the sources for the N20/N20m deﬂection after median nerve stimulation were localized lateral to those after ulnar nerve stimulation (3 –8 mm) for 4 of the 5 subjects, and in one medial to it (S1, 4 mm). With the MNE, a similar mediolateral difference (5 – 10 mm) was seen in 3 of the 4 subjects for whom the N20 source for ulnar nerve could be localized. For the P70/P70m deﬂection, the ECD tended to localize the sources for median nerve stimulation anterior (0 – 12 mm) and lateral (1 –10 mm; in S3, 10 mm medial) to those for ulnar nerve stimulation. Determined with the MNE, the median nerve representation was anterior (4 mm) and lateral (2 and 9 mm) to the ulnar nerve representation in two subjects, medial to it in one subject (S1, 12 mm), and identical with it in another subject (S2). In one subject (S4), the MNE again failed to localize the source for ulnar nerve stimulation. Using either the ECD or the MNE, there were no systematic differences between the N20/N20m and the P70/70m localizations. 3.2. Computational estimation of the accuracy of the MNE In the simulation of a 20-nAm tangential dipole at the cortical surface with various locations and orientations, Tikhonov regularization of the MNE with the parameter 1025 led to a source localization error of 4 ^ 1mmina noiseless situation; this error was approximately the resolution of the computation grid, which ultimately restricted the localization accuracy.

MNE and ECD source localizations for the N20/N20m and the P70/P70m deﬂections after median nerve stimulation in Subject 1, shown with respect to the individual anatomy. The MNE peaked at 23 and 63 ms, and the ECDs were best ﬁtted at 22 and 69 ms. The distance between the MNE and ECD localizations was 10 and 9 mm for the N20/N20m and the P70/P70m responses, respectively. The yellow circle indicates the cortical surface in the head model, lying 20 mm above the spherical computation layer for the MNE. S. Komssi et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 115 (2004) 534–542 539 noise, with the same RMS amplitude (0.2 mV) as in the averaged SEPs, was added to the potential, the MNE localized the source 5 ^ 3 mm from its actual position. With the regularization parameters 1023 and 1024, allowing a relatively wide source distribution, the average localization error was not changed, being 5 ^ 2 mm for both. The parameter 1026 resulted in an average mislocalization of 14 mm, because more noise was picked up. A dipole positioned at the depth of 3 mm below the MNE computation surface led to a mislocalization of 7 ^ 4 mm (regularization parameter 1025). At 10 mm below the computation surface, the dipole was localized 15 ^ 8mm (regularization parameter 1024) from its actual location. At the depth of 20 mm below the computation surface, localization of the source did not succeed. In one subject (S3), the potentials of superﬁcial 20-nAm tangential dipoles placed at 6 different locations around the sensorimotor cortex were calculated at the digitized electrode locations. The electrode locations were then ﬁtted to the surface of the spherical model prior to the calculation of the lead ﬁelds. The mean distance between the digitized and ﬁtted electrode locations was 11.5 mm. In this situation, the MNE localized the sources at 10 ^ 6 mm from the original dipole positions. 4. Discussion We evaluated the accuracy of the L2-minimum-norm estimation in the localization of activity at S1 measured with multichannel EEG. No a priori knowledge about the source location was introduced, apart from restricting the source to a certain depth. Compared with ECD locations obtained from SEFs, a mean localization accuracy of 13 mm was reached in 0.2-mV RMS noise. In addition to locating the S1c hand area, the MNE reconstruction allowed us also to separate the sources activated by the median nerve from those activated by the ulnar nerve stimulation with an accuracy approximately comparable to that of the ECDs derived from SEFs. Simulations together with the measured data indicated that, with a proper estimate of the source depth and with a good ﬁt of the head model, a 5-mm mean accuracy can be reached. We chose to focus on SEPs from S1c, because their generators are relatively well known from EEG and MEG studies (Allison et al., 1989, 1991a,b; Buchner et al., 1996; Deiber et al., 1986; Desmedt and Bourguet, 1985; Desmedt and Tomberg, 1989; Goff et al., 1977; Huttunen et al., 1987; Jones and Power, 1984; Kawamura et al., 1996; Maccabee et al., 1983; Mauguie`re et al., 1983; Rossini et al., 1989; Sutherling et al., 1988; Tiihonen et al., 1989; Wikstro¨m et al., 1996; Wood et al., 1985). We analyzed the N20/N20m and P70/P70m deﬂections, as these were explained by mainly tangentially oriented currents and were thus detectable both in EEG and MEG. We used high-pass ﬁltering with relatively high cut-off frequencies to ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio; this affected the SEP waveform conﬁguration so that the individual peak latencies were somewhat different from those usually found in the literature. Because of the curved course of the central sulcus at the hand region of S1 and the somatotopic organization of this area, the cortical representation for the ulnar nerve is usually located more medially and slightly more posteriorly than that for the median nerve (Penﬁeld and Jasper, 1954). In our study, the difference of these representations was demon- strated in the mediolateral direction for the N20/N20m, and Fig. 4. Individual x- and y-coordinates for the MNE ( # median nerve; c ulnar nerve) and ECD (W median nerve; K ulnar nerve) source localizations for the N20/N20m and the P70/P70m responses; the mean locations (^SD) are given below. The lines connect source locations for median and ulnar nerve stimulation for each subject, deﬂection, and localization method. The origin of the Cartesian coordinate system was at the center of the head model, x-axis pointing to the right and y-axis in the anterior direction. S. Komssi et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 115 (2004) 534–542540 in both the mediolateral and anteroposterior direction for the P70/P70m. In essence, the MNE appeared equally accurate compared with the ECD in separating the closely spaced sources corresponding to ulnar and median nerves from each other. In one previous study, ECD locations derived from scalp- recorded SEPs were compared with localizations obtained from electrocorticography; a mean distance of 8 mm was found (Sutherling et al., 1988). Some studies have applied spatiotemporal forward modelling (BESA; Megis Software, Inc., Germany) to scalp-recorded SEPs. In the study of Buchner et al. (1995), comparison with the electrocortico- gram yielded a distance less than 9 mm from the central sulcus. These authors also found a mean localization difference of 6 mm between two serial recordings. In an oddball somatosensory paradigm, an average interoperator difference of 14 mm in dipole locations was found with BESA (Miltner et al., 1994). Thus, our MNE accuracies were comparable to those determined previously with dipole modelling methods applied to SEP data. In the simulations we assessed the effects of two sources of localization error, which were likely to account for the most part of the MNE localization inaccuracy. The ﬁrst source of error was the inadequacy of the spherical head model. To derive the MNE from the scalp EEG, the digitized electrode locations were ﬁrst ﬁtted to the outer- most sphere of the 4-layer head model. The lead ﬁelds, which depend on the electrode locations with respect to the source space, were calculated after this ﬁtting. The consequent shift in the electrode positions, reﬂecting the insufﬁency of the sphere in the estimation of the head shape, obviously affected the lead ﬁelds. We showed that the MNE localization error due to the head model was on the order of 10 mm; hence, the use of realistic head models could signiﬁcantly improve localization accuracy. Another poten- tial source of mislocalization related to the head model lies in the conductivity values used for the different tissues. Our head model was based on the widely used conductivity values reported by Peters and de Munck (1990). Yet, the estimates on the conductivity of different head tissues, especially of the skull, may vary by a factor of up to 5 (Ferree et al., 2000; Oostendorp et al., 2000). A second signiﬁcant source of localization inaccuracy was the use of a spherical surface as the computation space for the MNE solutions. Instead of a 3 dimensional space, a 2-dimensional surface was chosen in order to limit the computational load of the inverse calculation. The 4096- point grid at the preset depth of 20 mm below the innermost sphere of the head model was adopted to represent the neocortical surface. This is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation of the folded cortical structure and necessarily introduces errors when locating sources with a depth signiﬁcantly different from 20 mm. We showed with the simulations that even relatively small deviations of the actual source depth from 20 mm led to slight mislocalization of the source also in tangential directions. An improved localization might be achieved by calculating the MNE in a 3-dimensional space. Then, however, the solution would tend to overemphasize superﬁcial sources at the cost of deep ones. There have been attempts to overcome this problem by normalizing the lead ﬁelds to account for the depth effect (i.e. weighting the MNE solution). With a weighted MNE and a realistic head model, an accuracy of 8 mm has been attained (Babiloni et al., 2000). The accuracy of the MNE solution might be further improved, e.g., by repetitive calculation of the current, dropping out the grid points with the smallest current densities at each calculation step and, in this way, searching the active brain areas iteratively (Gorodnitsky et al., 1995; Srebro, 1996). Laplacian transformation of EEG prior to the inverse calculation has also been suggested (Babiloni et al., 2000). We conclude that the S1 hand area can be reasonably well localized by applying the L2-MNE on scalp recorded SEPs. In future studies, utilization of realistic head models and a 3-dimensional computation space may increase MNE localization accuracy.
