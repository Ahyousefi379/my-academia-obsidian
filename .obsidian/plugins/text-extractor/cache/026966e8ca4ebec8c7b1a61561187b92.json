ABSTRACT: Hypoxia and overexpression of glutathione (GSH) are typical characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which severely hinders cancer treatments. Here we design a novel biodegradable therapeutic system, O2-Cu/ZIF- 8@Ce6/ZIF-8@F127 (OCZCF), to simultaneously achieve GSH depletion and O2- enhanced combination therapy. Notably, the doped Cu2+ doubles the O2 storage capacity of ZIF-8 matrix, which makes OCZCF an excellently pH-sensitive O2 reservoir for conquering tumor hypoxia, enhancing the photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficiency of Ce6 under 650 nm laser irradiation. Moreover, the released Cu2+ can act as a smart reactive oxygen species (ROS) protector by consuming intracellular GSH. The byproduct Cu+ will undergo highly efficient Fenton-like reaction to achieve chemodynamic therapy (CDT) in the presence of abundant H2O2. The accompanying O2 Page 2 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 3 will further alleviate hypoxia. The in vitro and in vivo experimental data indicate that OCZCF could cause remarkable tumor inhibition through enhanced synergetic PDT and CDT, which may open up a new path for cancer therapy. 1. INTRODUCTION Page 3 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 4 The recent report suggests that cancer death rates have decreased over the past two decades. However, malignant tumors are still one of the diseases that currently pose a serious threat to human health and life. Hence, fighting against tumors needs continued basic and clinical research.1 Nowadays, photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) have emerged as burgeoning cancer treatments.2-9 For the most common type II PDT process, a photosensitizer (PS) is prerequisite to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) with the assistance of O2 under a specific wavelength of light, then the 1O2 will induce cell apoptosis.2-5 CDT is first proposed by Bu and Shi et al., iron-based Fenton reaction is primitively utilized to kill cancer cells via transforming intracellular H2O2 to the highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH).6 Afterwards, MnO2 and copper ions are also developed for CDT.7-9 Exactly, the 1O2 and •OH are the most widespread components in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause great damages to tumor cells. Besides, the literature has shown that ROS-mediated cancer treatment may cause more damages to cancer cells than normal cells due to the different redox states, making them extremely competitive in the treatment of cancers.10 Page 4 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 5 However, the tumor microenvironment (TME) with hypoxia seriously affects the therapeutic efficiency.11,12 Type II PDT mechanism involves the change from triplet ground state molecular oxygen (3O2) to the more reactive 1O2. So this process requires the participation of O2 and will result in a large amount of O2 consumption.11,12 Unfortunately, the rapid proliferation of tumors lead to the widespread hypoxia in solid tumors.13 Thus, the PDT process will in turn aggravate hypoxia. Such a vicious cycle would greatly reduce the effectiveness of PDT. To solve this problem, some O2 storage materials, such as hemoglobin,14,15 perfluorocarbon16,17 and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),18-20 have been employed to relieve the hypoxia within tumors. In addition, some nanozymes are also widely utilized for in situ O2 generation to relievie intracellular hypoxia, mainly including catalase,21,22 MnO2,23,24 platinum(IV) diazido complexes,25 platinum,26 MnFe2O4,27 carbon nitride28 and so on. Another challenge for cancer therapy is that glutathione (GSH) is inherently excessive in tumor sites (up to 10 mM).29,30 The strong reducibility of GSH consumes cytotoxic ROS produced by therapeutic agents, which would significantly reduce the efficiency of cancer treatment. Therefore, reducing intracellular GSH is very necessary for Page 5 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 6 oncotherapy. At present, the most common method is using nanomaterials to reduce intracellular GSH levels. For instance, Stone and coworkers employed a cysteinase enzyme to reduce L-cysteine, which is essential for the production of GSH, thereby decreasing the level of intracellular GSH indirectly.31 Tan’s group and Chen’s group reported MnO2 nanosystems for enhanced cancer therapy by reducing endocellular GSH content, respectively.8,32 Qu’s group employed copper(II)-graphitic carbon nitride to improve ROS accumulation and reduce GSH content for enhanced PDT.33 In fact, the complicated TME can make tumors drug resistant, limiting single cancer therapies. Combination therapy can solve this problem well, which presents a promising strategy for oncotherapy. The most marvelous advantage of this program is that it can minimize the drug doses while maximizing its efficacy.34-36 Therefore, exploring novel system that could integrate multiple treatments is of great significance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous organic-inorganic hybrid materials assembled by organic ligands and metal ions via coordinate bonds.37 Due to their unique advantages, such as porosity, variety of species, and degradability, making them biologically friendly and have been broadly studied for oncotherapy.38-40 Some copper- Page 6 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 7 based MOFs, such as UMCM-152, HKUST-1, and NU-125, have been reported as excellent O2 storage matrials attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites,41,42 which shows great prospects in overcoming tumor hypoxia for enhanced PDT. Cu2+ can also play a role in reducing GSH.33 Besides, a recent report reveals that copper-based materials could act as Fenton reagents for CDT.9 However, The instability in vivo limits the biological applications of these Cu-based MOFs. Among MOFs family, zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are first reported by Yaghi’s group, which has exceptional chemical and thermal stability.43 Our group recently reported the use of ZIF- 90 as an O2 carrier to overcome tumor hypoxia for enhanced PDT.18 However, due to the innate limitation of ZIF materials, its oxygen storage capacity is confined. ZIF-8 is an another classic material belonging to ZIFs. Interestingly, ZIF-8 is degradable in acid TME. Moreover, the preparation condition of ZIF-8 is mild and the cost is relatively low, so ZIF-8 has been broadly utilized as a pH-degradable drug carrier in nanomedicine.21,44,45 It has been reported that ZIF-8 possesses the ability to store O2.46 Nevertheless, it is still limited compared with those copper-containing MOFs.41,42 In view of this, we speculate that by doping Cu2+ into ZIF-8, the O2 storage capacity can be Page 7 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 8 enhanced. On this basis, if the PS is further integrated into it, a therapeutic platform with enhanced PDT and CDT could be obtained, which would show great potential for TME- responsive combination therapy. As a proof-of-concept study, the O2-Cu/ZIF-8@Ce6/ZIF-8@F127 (OCZCF) core-shell nanostructure is designed to simultaneously overcome tumor hypoxia and reduce GSH level for enhanced PDT and CDT. As shown in Scheme 1, Cu2+-doped ZIF-8 (Cu/ZIF-8) is first fabricated via a simply ion doping stratagy. Then, a thin layer of ZIF-8 encapsulating the well-known PS, i.e. Ce6, is coated on Cu/ZIF-8, followed by overlaying a layer of F127, which is a highly biocompatible polymer. After intravenous (i.v.) injection, OCZCF could accumulate in Page 8 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 9 Scheme 1.

The large amount of O2 would alleviate tumor hypoxia and allow the quick generation of abundant cytotoxic 1O2 by Ce6 under 650 nm laser irradiation. In addition, the released Cu2+ could oxidize intratumoral GSH, inducing GSH depletion. The generated Cu+ could futher react with H2O2 in TME, inducing high efficient Fenton-like reaction to generate •OH and O2 for CDT. As a result, this integrated nanodrug shows synergistically enhanced antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1.

As the Cu2+ content increasing, the crystal size increases dramatically while the product yield decreases fast. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) indicates that the doped Cu2+ does not affect the crystal structure of ZIF-8 (Figure 1a and Figure S2). It is reported that nano carriers in the sub-100 nm size could be transported into tumor blood vessels via EPR effect.47-49 Therefore, we optimize the feeding ratio of Cu2+ to be 25%. DLS analysis, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures show the size of Cu/ZIF-8 is about 75 nm (Figure 1b-d and Table S2). The O2 adsorption isotherms confirm the enhanced O2 storage capacity of Cu/ZIF-8. At 1 atmospheric pressure, the adsorbed O2 volume of Cu/ZIF-8 is about twice higher than pure ZIF-8 (Figure 2a). Meanwhile, it is up to 6.7 times higher than hemoglobin, which is the normal oxygen storage component of human body with the maximun O2-binding capacity of 1.34 cc g-1.52,53 This result implies that Cu/ZIF-8 could act as a more effective oxygen carrier than hemoglobin. Page 13 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 14 After loading O2, ZIF-8 shell grows spontaneously onto the Cu/ZIF-8 seed attributed to the isotropy.54 Ce6 is embedded into ZIF-8 shell by a one-pot process at the same time.55 The O2-Cu/ZIF-8@Ce6/ZIF-8 (OCZC) with an average size of 85 nm is obtained. (Figure 1g and Table S2). EDS mapping results (Figure 1g) testify the uniformly dispersed cuprum in Cu/ZIF-8 core, further confirming the core-shell structure. The loading amount of Ce6 is calculated to be 3.34 wt% by UV-vis absorption spectra (Figure 2b and Figure S3). Nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments show the type I isotherms of Cu/ZIF-8 and CZC, suggesting the presence of micropores (Figure 2c and Table S3). Finally, an amphiphilic polymer Pluronic F127, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, was coated around OCZC to improve the biocompatibility of nanocomposites.56-57 DLS, TEM and SEM results show the size of O2-Cu/ZIF- 8@Ce6/ZIF-8@F127 (OCZCF) increased to about 95 nm (Figure 1b, 1e, 1f, and Table S2). The doped Cu2+ sites were also determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The peaks at 934.1 and 953.8 eV are assigned to the Cu(2p3/2) and Cu(2p1/2) of Cu2+, respectively58,59 (Figure S4). The satellite peak at around 942.3 eV also indicates the characteristic of Cu2+. In Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, the absorption Page 14 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 15 peaks at 1584 and 1710 cm−1 are the C=N and C(=O)-OH stretching vibration in ZIF-860 and Ce661, respectively (Figure 2d). Peaks at 2873, 1100 and 840 cm−1 belong to the vibration of C-H and C-O-C bonds in F12762. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) show an additional sharp weight loss of OCZCF between 300 to 450 °C compared with Cu/ZIF-8, corresponding to the decomposition of Ce663 and F12764 (Figure 2e). 2.2. pH-Responsive Drug Release Behavior. To characterize the pH-degradability of OCZCF, nanoparticles were soaked in PBS buffer with pH = 7.4 and 6.5, respectively. The SEM and TEM images of the precipitation were shown in Figure S5 and S6. In neutral environment (pH = 7.4), the crystal keeps its morphorlogy. However, when treated with acidic PBS solution, the crystal structure rapidly disassembles over time. The complete collapse of OCZCF could be observed after 10 min stirring, confirming the pH-sensitiveness of OCZCF.44 In addition, the O2 release behavior of OCZCF in deoxidized PBS buffer is shown in Figure 2f. In acidic condition (pH = 6.5), the curve increases sharply whereas only a plateau is observed in the neutral counterpart, indicating the pH-responsive O2 release Page 15 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 16 property. Moreover, compared with O2-ZIF-8 (Figure 2g), the amount of O2 released by OCZCF increases by 1.7 times, which reveals the expanded O2 loading capacity after doping with Cu ions. Furthermore, the released Ce6 and Cu2+ were detected via UV-Vis spectroscopy and ICP, respectively (Figure 2h, 2i and Table S4). As the pH value decreases to 6.5, more than 90% of Ce6 and 85% of Cu2+ are released due to the decomposition of OCZCF. The above results suggest that OCZCF has big potential to be used as an effective on-demand drug delivery system.

ROS Detection and GSH Consumption. It was reported that 1,3- diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) could undergo a Diels-Alder 1,4-cycloaddition reaction with 1O2, inducing the decrease of its absorption at 410 nm.22, 44 Therefore, we used DPBF to characterize the production of 1O2 of different composites under 650 nm light irradiation. As shown in Figure 3a, the degradation rate of DPBF in neutral solution is much lower than that in acidic condition. This could be explained by the reduced photo- quenching effect of Ce6 after the decomposition of nanocomposites in acidic condition.45 Interestingly, the most significant decrease is observed for DPBF treated with OCZCF in acidic solution, revealing that the released O2 could greatly enhance the Page 18 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 19 1O2 generation ability of Ce6 in hypoxic environment. Moreover, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were carried out to identify the generated 1O2, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) was used as the trapping agent to detect 1O2 generation. As shown in Figure S7, the ESR spectrum of OCZCF upon light shows a 1:1:1 triplet signal, which belongs to 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO)65. This result directly confirms the generation of 1O2. Besides, the Cu2+-involved GSH consumption was validated using a reduced GSH assay kit.46 Compared with the control group and ZIF-8 treated solution, the concentration of GSH decreased obviously when treated with Cu/ZIF-8 (Figure S8). Moreover, the GSH concentration exhibits a dose-dependent manner with the amount of OCZCF (Figure 3b), indicating the GSH depletion by OCZCF. Meanwhile, the byproduct, Cu+, was confirmed via XPS and ESR spectroscopy in term of the disappearence of the satellite peak in XPS and the intense signal in the high field of Cu2+ in ESR spectrum, respectively (Figure 3c and Figure S9).9,51 The generated cuprous ions were reported to be more active in producing •OH in mild acidic TME (pH = 6.5) than the traditionally used Fe2+ ions,9 which shows big potential Page 19 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 20 for effecient CDT. Herein, ESR measurements were performed to identify the generation of •OH, and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was used as the trapping agent. As shown in Figure S10, the ESR spectrum of OCZCF with H2O2 shows a 1:2:2:1 quartet characteristic with the addition of DMPO due to the generation of DMPO-OH, demonstrating •OH formation by OCZCF.65 Then, methyl blue (MB) was employed further for •OH detection. When treated with H2O2 or H2O2+OCZCF, the absorption peak intensity of MB almost does not change in comparision with pure MB solution (Figure 3d). However, it decreases sharply in the coexistence of MB, H2O2, GSH and OCZCF, which reveals the generation of •OH. Besides, Figure 3e shows the time-dependent degradation process of MB in the mixture of MB, H2O2, GSH and OCZCF, suggesting the GSH-assisted Fenton-like reaction of OCZCF. Furthermore, the dissolved oxygen meter demonstrates that CZCF could successfully catalyze H2O2 to generate O2, which provides the possibility for further alleviation of hypoxia owing to the high H2O2 concentration of TME (Figure 3f). 2.4. Cell Apoptosis Analysis. Before cytotoxic assay, the biocompatibility of OCZCF on L929 cells was assessed via 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazole bromide Page 20 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 21 (MTT) assay. As shown in Figure 3g, cells treated with different amount of OCZCF show high survival rate even at a concentration of 200 μg mL-1, indicating the biostability of OCZCF. Cellular uptake mechanism was investigated by ICP. As shown in Table S5, due to its good biocompatibility, the OCZCF can be endocytosed gradually by L929 (mouse fibroblast cells) and 4T1 cells (mouse breast cancer cells) at 6 h. Figure S11 shows the GSH content of 4T1 cells incubated with PBS (control group), ZCF (ZIF-8@Ce6/ZIF-8@F127) and CZCF, respectively. For cells treated with different amount of ZCF, the GSH concentration stays in relatively high level compred with the control group. Whereas for CZCF treated group, the amount of intracellular GSH drops quickly as the drug concentration increasing. These data reveal that the copper- containing CZCF composites are able to consume GSH in tumor cells, which brings the possibility for high efficient PDT and CDT. Next, in vitro therapeutic effect was characterized by MTT assay on 4T1 cells treated with PBS with light (PBS+), Ce6 with light (Ce6+), CZCF, OCZCF, CZCF+, and OCZCF+, respectively. Cells were exposed to normoxic (21 % oxygen) or hypoxic (1% oxygen) environments. As shown in Figure 3h, light irradiation at low power density Page 21 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 22 shows negligible effect towards 4T1 cells. For Ce6+ treated groups, the cell viability in hypoxia is much higher than that in normoxia, which suggests the cytotoxicity of Ce6 is greatly dependent on O2 concentration. Figure 3i shows the curative effect of CZCF and OCZCF under normoxia and hypoxia, respectively. For cells treated with 21% O2, the cellular lethality in all groups exhibits a dose-dependent manner, especially for light treated groups. This could be explained by the synergetic effect of CDT and PDT. However, the cell viability varies in hypoxic condition. In comparation with deoxidized counterparts, OCZCF shows significantly enhanced cytotoxicity, which proves the importance of hypoxia alleviation for synergetic therapy. Noted that the single treatment is less efficient, which reveals the advantage of synergetic therapy. Page 22 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 23 Figure 4. (a) In vitro ROS and hypoxia imaging of 4T1 cells. (b) Live/dead cell staining of 4T1 cells after incubation with PBS+, Ce6+, CZCF, OCZCF, CZCF+ or OCZCF+ under hypoxic condition. The green signals indicate the living cells. The red signals indicate the dead cells. Scale bar indicates 50 μm. 2.5. Intracellular Detection of ROS and Hypoxia. To evaluate the generation of O2 and ROS in vitro, 4T1 cells were treated with PBS (noted as control group), CZCF, OCZCF, CZCF with light (CZCF+), or OCZCF with light (OCZCF+) under normoxia (21 % oxygen) or hypoxia (1% oxygen), respectively. The intracellular ROS and hypoxic condition were stained by a ROS/hypoxia detection kit (Figure 4a). Compared with the control group, the red signal decreases for CZCF and CZCF+ treated cells, which reveals the alleviation of hypoxia by Cu-mediated Fenton-like reaction. However, it is almost invisible in OCZCF and OCZCF+ treated groups due to the abundent O2 released from OCZCF in acidic TME. The generated ROS through Fenton-like reaction is revealed by the green fluorecence appeared in CZCF and OCZCF treated cells, demonstrating the CDT process. Besides, after 650 nm light irradiation, the green signal sharply increases Page 23 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 24 both in CZCF+ and OCZCF+ treated groups. This could be explained by the enhanced ROS generation ability in the synergistic CDT and PDT. Most importantly, compared with CZCF and CZCF+, both OCZCF and OCZCF+ show enhanced ROS generation ability under hypoxic condition, respectively. These results indicate that the O2- containing multifunctional OCZCF nanoplatform could successfully overcome tumor hypoxia and facilitate the generation of large amount of ROS in living tumor cells. Furthermore, we also proved the effects by the immunofluorescence staining assay in vivo. It is well-known that the hypoxia in the TME can trigger the expression of hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF)-1α. To identify the nanoparticles possess the ability to relieve tumor hypoxia, mice tumor slices were obtained for HIF-1α (red) staining assay after being injected 24 h. Meanwhile, the production of ROS also has been demonstrated by tumor slices staining DCFH-DA (green) after different treatments (Figure S12). The results were consistent with those for in vitro experiments. Besides, the in vitro cellular viability in hypoxia was also tested by a Live/Dead Cell Double Staining Kit. The red signal indicates dead cells while the green signal reveals living cell (Figure 4b). As expected, OCZCF+ show highest lethality, which is in Page 24 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 25 accordance with the MTT assay. Similar results are observed by flow cytometry analysis shown in Figure S13, which suggest that OCZCF nanodrug could be used for efficient tumor hypoxia alleviation and in vitro tumor therapy. 2.6. In Vivo Tumor Inhibition. 4T1-tumor bearing Balb/c mice were used for in vivo anti-tumor experiments. All mice were randomly divided into 6 groups for PBS, Ce6+, OCZCF, CZCF+, and OCZCF+ treatments, respectively. All drugs were tail intravenous injected into Figure 5 (a) Relative tumor volume and (b) average body weight of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Error bars indicate the standard deviations (n = 6). P values by comparing the CZCF+ or OCZCF+ group with other control groups were calculated by two-tailed Page 25 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 26 Student’s t-test (***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, or *p < 0.05) (c) Photos of mice at the end of treatments. Histological analysis of (d) tumor sections and (e) tissue sections at the end of treatments. Scale bars are 50 μm. mice with the concentration of Ce6 to be 4.0 mg kg-1. Then, the light treated (+) groups were exposed to 650 nm light for 10 min at the power dencity of 50 mW cm-2. Tumor size and body weight of mice in each group were monitored for 15 days after drug treatment. As shown in Figure 5a, 5c and Figure S14, Ce6+ treated mice show similar tumor growth rate as PBS group due to the inefficient tumor retention of Ce6. For OCZCF treated mice, the slightly suppressed tumor growth indicates the co-effect of GSH depletion and CDT caused by the released Cu ions from OCZCF. After treating with light, OCZCF exhibits significant enhanced tumor inhibition ability. On day 15, the relative tumor volume of mice treated with OCZCF+ is about one third of that in OCZCF group. The difference should be attributed to the synergetic PDT and CDT effect. Notebly, the tumor regression rate of OCZCF+ treated mice is also much higher than that induced by CZCF+. The result suggests the alleviation of tumor hypoxia is of great Page 26 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 27 significance in enhancing synergistic therapeutic efficiency. Similar tumor suppression behavior are observed in H&E staining of tumor tissues, in which tumors treated with CZCF+ and OCZCF+ exhibit more necrosis slices (Figure 5d). In addition, the evenly increased body weight, histological analyses and hematological indicators of mice in each experiment groups show negligible side eﬀects of OCZCF(Figure 5b, 5e, Table S6). Therefore, the oxygen loaded OCZCF could be used as an efficient and biocompatible nanodrug for enhanced synergistic therapy. 2.7. In Vivo biodistribution of OCZCF. In order to determine the in vivo biodistribution of OCZCF, the organs including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and tumors were gathered at intervals after tail vein injection. The zinc levels were ascertained by ICP- MS. Figure S15 reveals that during the first 12 h after tail vein injection, the OCZCF primarily accumulated in liver and spleen. Because of the EPR effect,47-49 the cumulative amount of OCZCF reaches the maximum in tumors at around 24 h. Then amount of OCZCF began to decline with the incremental time. 3. CONCLUSIONS Page 27 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 28 In summary, we successfully fabricated a pH-degradable core/shell-structured nanoplatform, O2-Cu/ZIF-8@Ce6/ZIF-8@F127 (OCZCF), with TME responses for synergistic photo/chemo-dynamic therapy. The doped Cu2+ can double the O2 loading capacity of ZIF-8, which is in favor of overcoming hypoxic TME and increasing the ROS amount generated by Ce6 under 650 nm laser irradiation. More importantly, the released Cu2+ can not only oxidize intratumoral GSH, reducing the unnecessary ROS consumption caused by GSH, but also catalyze the overexpressed H2O2 in TME to generate O2 for further hypoxia alleviation. Noticeably, the byproduct, Cu+, will further induce CDT process by reacting with H2O2 to produce cytotoxic •OH via Fenton-like reaction. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that OCZCF shows better antitumor efficacy through GSH depletion and O2 replenishment in the combination therapy. This integrated nanoplatform may open up a new way for engeneering high efficient therapeutic reagents for clinical tumor treatment. 4.

The as-synthesized samples (weight 40 - 60 mg) were Page 30 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 31 dried in air and subsequently dried in desiccator under vacuum. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained from JES-FA200 Spectrometers (JEOL). 4.3. Fabrication of ZIF-8, Cu-doped ZIF-8 (Cu/ZIF-8) and O2-Cu/ZIF-8@Ce6/ZIF- 8@F127 (OCZCF). The ultrasmall ZIF-8 nanoparticles were prepared with the method modified from literature.50,51 In brief, 2-MI (1.62 g) was mixed with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (733.2 mg) in methanol. After stirring at room temperature for 30 min, the final white products were purified by centrifuging. Cu/ZIF-8 was prepared as mentioned above except for using the mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Cu(NO3)2·6H2O with desired amount instead of pure Zn(NO3)2·6H2O powder. The final products were collected under centrifugation. For the fabrication of O2-loaded nanocarrier, Cu/ZIF-8 nanoparticles were vacuum dried to eliminate excess methanol in pores. After pumping with O2 for 3 days, the products were redispersed in methanol for further use. Then, photosensitizer Ce6 loaded ZIF-8 shell was homogeneously grown around O2-Cu/ZIF-8. Ce6 (2 mg) and Cu/ZIF-8 (20 mg) were first dispersed in 2-MI solution (10 mL, 0.01 M) and then mixed with Zn(NO3)2·6H2O solution (10 mL, 0.01 M). The mixture was stirred at room temperature Page 31 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 32 for 2 h. The dark green products were collected by centrifugation and dissolved in EtOH. Finally, F127 (5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of EtOH and mixed with OCZC solution (1mL) for 2 h. The final products were obtained by centrifugation. 4.4. Drug Release Property. To measure the oxygen release behavior, OCZCF (40 mg) was dispersed in deoxygenated PBS solution (20 mL, pH = 6.5 and 7.4). Then the dissolved O2 amount was read by a portable dissolved oxygen meter. The released Ce6 was analyzed using UV–Vis spectrometer. OCZCF were dispersed in PBS solution (pH = 6.5 and 7.3). Then, the supernatant was taken out at pre-determined time points and dilute with EtOH. The absorbance of Ce6 at 410 nm was measured, based on a standard curve of free Ce6. ICP was used to characterize copper ions released from OCZCF. OCZCF were dispersed in PBS solution (pH = 6.5 and 7.3). The supernatant were diluted by 10 times before test. 4.5. ROS Generation. Singlet oxygen (1O2) generated by Ce6 under light irradiation (650 nm, 50 mW cm-1) was measured with DPBF probe.66 DPBF solution (pH = 6.5 and 7.3) was added with CZCF or OCZCF, respectively. Next, UV-Vis spectrometer was used for DPBF analysis. The generation of extracellular hydroxyl radicals (•OH) was Page 32 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 33 measured with MB.67 All materials were mixed in PBS buffer (pH = 6.5) containing MB (0.01 μg mL-1). For ESR measurements, 100 µL of aqueous solution of samples (1 mg/L) was mixed with 500 µL of TEMP (50 mM) solution. After being irradiated upon 650 nm laser for 5 min, the mixture was characterized using a Bruker EMX plus model spectrometer operating at the X-band frequency at room temperature. The •OH detection was also performed as described above, except the irradiation and the use of DMPO (50 mM) as the spin-trapping agent. 4.6. GSH Depletion and O2 Generated by Fenton-Like Reaction. GSH depletion process was tested using reduced glutathione assay kit. In brief, GSH solution (0.01 mM, pH = 6.5) was stirred with ZIF-8, Cu/ZIF-8, and OCZCF, respectively. After centrifugation, the supernatant was measured in line with the accessary specification. The generation of O2 from H2O2 was tested using a portable dissolved oxygen meter. H2O2 (0.1 M) and CZCF (100 mg) were mixed in PBS buffer (pH = 6.5). The generated oxygen was read every 20 s. In comparation, the dissolved oxygen in CZCF solution (pH = 6.5) was also collected.

Intracellular GSH Consumption. 4T1 were seeded in 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well in complete DMEM. Then, cells were treated with PBS, ZCF (ZIF-8@Ce6/ZIF- 8@F127) or OCZCF for 12 h. For GSH detection, cells were centrifuged and the redispersed in metaphosphoric acid solution before lysis by three-circle of frozen and thaw. The supernatant was measured in line with the accessary specification. 4.8. Intracellular Hypoxia and ROS Detection. 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well in complete DMEM (2 mL) at 37 °C overnight. Then, cells were exposed to normoxic environment (21 % oxygen) or hypoxic environment (1% oxygen) with 5% CO2 for 8 h.

PBS, Ce6, CZCF and OCZCF was added to each well with different concentration, respectively. After 4 h incubation, the laser irradiation groups were treated with 650 nm laser at a power density of 50 mW cm−2 for 5 min. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for another 20 h before applying the MTT reagent. For the laser free groups, the plates were incubated in the incubator for 24 h after drug treatment. The absorbance was measured on a Bio- Rad 680 microplate reader at 490 nm. In addition, calcein-AM and propidium iodide were used to stain the live and dead cells. 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 1 × 105 cells per well and treated with PBS, Ce6, ZCF, CZCF or OCZCF under hypoxia, respectively. The concentration of nanodrug was 20 μg mL-1. The laser irradiation groups were exposed to 650 nm laser at a power density of 50 mW cm−2 for 5 min. Then, dye mixture were added into each well and incubated for 30 min in dark condition. After thoroughly washed with PBS, cells were observed under the inverted fluorescence microscopy. The cell viability after incubation with CZCF or OCZCF was conducted by flow cytometer under hypoxia. 4T1 cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates and Page 35 of 54 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 36 incubated with 20 μg mL-1 CZCF or OCZCF, respectively. 4 h later, cells were irradiated by 650 nm laser at a power density of 50 mW cm−2 for 5 min. After 8 h incubation, cells were thoroughly washed with trypsinization and PBS and stained by annexin V-FITC and PI staining kit. The cell apoptosis was characterized by FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). 4.10. In Vivo Tumor-Bearing Mice Experiment. Female Balb/c mice were purchased from the Center of Experimental Animals, Jilin University (Changchun, China). The animal experiments perform under the criterions of The National Regulation of China for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 30 mice (about 20 g) were subcutaneously injected with 1 × 106 4T1 cells to obtain tumor-bearing mice and separated into 5 groups (PBS, Ce6 with light irradiation (Ce6+), O2-Cu/ZIF@Ce6/ZIF-8@F127 (OCZCF), Cu/ZIF@Ce6/ZIF-8@F127 with light irradiation (CZCF+) and O2-Cu/ZIF@Ce6/ZIF- 8@F127 with light irradiation (OCZCF+) treated groups). Each group contained 6 mice and all materials were used with the Ce6 concentrations to be 4.0 mg kg−1 body weight. Nanoparticles were injected intravenously on the 1st and 3rd day. 650 nm laser (50 mW cm-2, 10 min) were used during the irradiation treatment after 24 h post injection.

Mice were euthanized after 15 days and the blood were harvested for hematology studies. 4.11. In vivo biodistribution of OCZCF. To determine the biodistribution of OCZCF, after i.v. injection, the tested organs and tumors from mice (n = 3) were gathered at intervals. Then the organs were weighted and dissolved in mixed solution of HCl and HNO3 (v/v = 3:1) under heating at 60 oC for 10 h. Finally, Zn content in different samples was measured by ICP-MS after being diluted with deionized water.
