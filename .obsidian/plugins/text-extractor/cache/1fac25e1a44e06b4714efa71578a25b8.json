DOI: 10.1002/adfm.202402432 1. Introduction All organisms share an adaptive nature, i.e., they can adapt to changes in both external and internal environments. More particularly, this adaptive behavior typically involves a physicochemical change in/of the organism in response to a particu- lar stimulus. Some examples are given in (Figure 1). In this context, a prominent ex- ample is that of the Mimosa pudica plant, which changes its leaf orientation in re- sponse to stimuli such as light, pressure, and temperature.[1] Another example from the plant kingdom is the carnivorous Venus ﬂytrap, which relies on motion activation to close its trap to catch prey.[2] Likewise, adaptable features are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. For instance, the Desert Horn Viper changes the look of its skin when it is hunting,[3] or Octopi, which can heavily mimic the shape and color to match their surroundings or even take on the appearance of other species. [4] In addi- tion, various biological processes occur in response to external stimuli, for instance J. F. R.

Biological examples of stimuli-responsive systems: a) Mimosa pudica, b) Venus’s ﬂytrap, c) Sand viper, d) Octopus, e) Adrenalin hormone, f) Hairs. when the human body experiences stressful conditions, nerves connected to the adrenal glands trigger the release of the adrenaline hormone,[5] or in response to cold temperatures, hairs on the body rise to trap warm air, thus providing insulation, a process called piloerection.[6] Inspired by these and other natu- ral phenomena, scientists have developed materials capable of mimicking such adaptive responses, so-called “smart” materials. These “smart” materials have been engineered to appropriately alter their properties in response to external physicochemical im- pulses. This engineered adaptive behavior is highly desirable, as materials can be “programmed” to ﬁt the needs of speciﬁc appli- cations and situations without human intervention or computer- ized control, such as earthquake-proofed buildings and bridges in Japan. In polymer science, adaptive or programmable features are highly desirable, as polymers nowadays are required to fulﬁll highly specialized roles to tackle the challenges in the realization of a circular economy, sustainable society, and advanced/ person- alized healthcare. To address these challenges, considerable eﬀort has been de- voted to the development of “smart” or responsive polymers, whereby physicochemical parameters such as solubility, volume, and/or conformation undergo controlled changes in response to external stimuli such as temperature, [7–11] pH, [12–14] light radiation,[15,16] electric ﬁelds,[17,18] bioactive molecules,[19,20] mag- netic ﬁelds,[21] presence of speciﬁc ions and mechanical force.[22] Therefore, using this property, external stimuli can inﬂuence the nature of polymers in such a way that they can perform a wide range of functions in areas such as drug delivery systems, bio- separation, sensing, bio-sensing, biomimetic actuators and im- mobilized biocatalysis. The ﬁrst instance of the thermal phase transition behavior of PNIPAM, one of the most studied responsive polymers was re- ported in 1967 by Scarpa et al.[23] Ever since, numerous articles have appeared on smart or stimuli-responsive polymers, covering their structure, synthesis, and application. Various polymer struc- tures and stimuli-responsive behaviors have been investigated, some representative examples of which are given in Table 1,and structures are mentioned in Figure 2. Given the limitless structural diversity of polymers, smart polymers with varying sizes, topologies, and compositions have been synthesized and shown promising behavior in several domains. The ﬁeld has particularly ﬂourished since the advent of controlled or “living” polymerization mechanisms such as nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), [24] atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), [25] reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymeriza- tion (RAFT),[26] ring-opening (metathesis) polymerization [27,28] as well as eﬃcient post-polymerization modiﬁcation strategies, most notably through the contributions of click chemistry.[29] With these tools, stimuli-responsive polymers have been de- signed with a myriad of topologies/morphologies, such as linear polymers (homopolymers, di/ter/multi-block copolymers, and organic/inorganic hybrid polymers) and non-linear polymers (star polymers, (hyper)-branched polymers) as illustrated in Figure 3. [30] Furthermore, by carefully controlling the polymer struc- ture, self-assembly can be induced, thus forming higher- order structures such as micelles, polymersomes, nanopar- ticles, or capsules. Alternatively, stimuli-responsive poly- mers can be grafted to a surface, generating “smart” sur- faces in the form of single/mixed polymer brushes, ﬁlms, porous membranes, or layer-by-layer (LBL) membranes.[31,32] Finally, 3D responsive polymer-based networks (i.e., hy- drogels and hydrogel particles, capsules, micelles) have also been generated using physical and/or chemical crosslinkers. [33] While various stimuli can induce a response from a suitably designed polymer, the application of temperature as a stimu- lus, or thermoresponsive behavior, has been the most widely investigated, owing to its vital roles in nature and the notice- able changes in polymer solubility, volume, and conformation that may be controlled across a large temperature range. Gen- erally, two categories of thermoresponsive polymers can be dis- tinguished, whereby the polymer displays either Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) or Upper Critical Solution Temper- ature (UCST) phase behavior, which relates to the occurrence of Adv.

Within this review, the most recent developments on the ex- tensively utilized LCST-type polymer PNIPAM will be covered in depth. PNIPAM is the most extensively studied LCST-type Figure 2.

From the perspective of the sol- vent, water, in most cases, acts as a good solvent at low temper- atures whereby favorable solvent-polymer interactions promote an expanded coil conformation. As temperature increases, the solvent becomes poorer and the polymer chains contract, pass- ing through a ϴ-point around the binodal, where the solvent Figure 4.

Beyond the ϴ-point, the polymer chains fully contract and adopt a globular state and the phase transition is complete, as shown in Figure 5. These glob- ules can further aggregate and form mesoglobules (Figure 6), a process that is often referred to as macroscopic phase separation between a high polymer concentration phase and a low polymer concentration phase. It should be emphasized, however, that it is diﬃcult to discern between phase transition and phase separa- tion, as these processes are dynamic and occur nearly simultane- ously. For PNIPAM speciﬁcally, the contribution of each process is still a matter of debate.[54-56] The phase transition and phase separation of polymers are directly correlated with the chemical structure of the poly- mer. The hydrophilic amide (─CONH─), hydrophobic isopropyl (─CH(CH3)2), and a (─CH2─CH═) backbone are the diﬀerent structural properties of PNIPAM that contribute to the phase change, with each having a unique contribution. [57] In general, this phase transition (Figure 7) is reversible in nature and in this case, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic states of the polymer can be switched by varying the temperature below or above the LCST value (32 °C for PNIPAM). The sudden change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behavior of the same polymer depends on hy- drogen bonds present between the polymer and the surround- ing water molecules at low temperatures. At low temperatures, the hydrogen bonds between water and the hydrophilic amide groups of PNIPAM cause the hydration and solubilization of the polymer chains, thus forming a one-phase system. With the in- crease in temperature, these hydrogen bonds become weak, and hydrophobic interactions lead to the phase transition, driven by the entropic release of the hydrating water molecules into the bulk water. From molecular dynamics studies, it was found that both the water coordination around the hydrophobic side chain and the solvent-accessible surface displayed a stronger decrease with the temperature. As a result, the translational entropy of wa- ter molecules increased. This entropic eﬀect linked to hydropho- bic hydration leads to the release of water from the hydration shell to the bulk water. [58,59] This can be seen in other examples of LCST poly- mers such as the following listed poly((meth)acrylamide)s: poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide),[34] poly(2-carboxyisopropylacry lamide), [60] poly(N-(L)-(1-hydroxymethyl) propylmeth-acrylam- ide, [61] poly(N-acryloyl-N’-propilpiperazine), [40] poly(N-ethylac- rylamide),[35] poly(N-methyl-N-ethylacrylamide),[35] poly(N- n-propylacrylamide), [35] poly(N-ethylmethacrylamide),[38] Figure 6.

In addi- tion, the adaptive response can also be regarded as a measur- able/observable output, thus enabling the detection or quantiﬁ- cation of physicochemical or biological events. Since sensors are tools that enable the generation of information or data of our sur- roundings, they are key in driving the generation of knowledge and the technological advancement of society. Given their usefulness, the development of lightweight, portable sensors with intrinsic responsivity, thus requiring no human or computerized intervention nor an energy source, is of tremendous interest. Hence, polymers are ideal materials for the development of sensors, as they enable miniaturization, a high degree of tunability, and multi-responsivity. While the ad- vantages of polymeric sensors are clear, still some challenges re- main, such as the handling of complex samples (e.g., blood), on- line/in vivo monitoring, measurable output, solid-state materi- als, complex structural relationships, recycling/reuse with recov- erability. In addition, a high degree of tunability also means that ﬁnding the right structure for the application can be challeng- ing thus being both labor-intensive on the synthesis and material testing fronts. To facilitate the development of suitable polymer- based sensors, the polymer design is typically ﬁne-tuned to match the application, whereby general considerations will be outlined below. While PNIPAM possesses intrinsic responsivity to tempera- ture in aqueous environments and to the ionic strength of aque- ous solutions, it lacks responsivity to other stimuli as well as the ability to report its phase transition behavior at low con- centrations or with low limit of detection (LOD). Hence, other functional moieties are incorporated in the PNIPAM structure mostly by statistical copolymerization or chain-end functional- ization. The incorporation of reporter molecules, such as ﬂuo- rescent dyes, [66–71] or Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) pairs,[72] can facilitate the quantiﬁcation and read-out of the response or provide a simple colorimetric signal. In this re- spect, the phase transition behavior of PNIPAM plays an impor- tant role in photophysical processes such as FRET, and Aggrega- tion Induced Enhanced Emission (AIEE), which beneﬁt from the intra- and inter-chain aggregation to increase the response and sensitivity. In addition to reporter moieties, several sensing moi- eties have been prominently incorporated in the PNIPAM struc- ture, such as phenyl boronic acids,[73–80] crown ethers,[81–85] and pH-responsive groups,[86] to enable responsivity to and sensing of pH, glucose, ions and other biomolecules. The physicochem- ical changes of these sensing moieties upon exposure to their stimuli often directly aﬀect the hydration of the PNIPAM-based structure, thus aﬀecting the phase transition behavior. The incorporation of such moieties can be performed by mod- ifying the chain-end of PNIPAM, or by the incorporation of functional or reactive comonomers, thus enabling the incorpo- ration of these groups in the polymer chain. In this fashion, it is possible to modify not only the speciﬁc composition, such as the comonomer ratio, but also the distribution of these groups along the polymer chain, changing them from statistical to block-copolymers. By modulating the compositional features of the PNIPAM-based structures non-covalent interactions driving self-assembly can be controlled, e.g., the formation of micelles from block-copolymers,[87–89] double hydrophilic block copoly- mer (DHBC).[90] Such compartmentalization in supramolecular structures can again be exploited for increased sensitivity or en- hanced detection sensitivity, water dispersibility, biocompatibil- ity, facile incorporation into devices, and the ability of further functionalization for targeted imaging and detection. In addition to linear polymers, a variety of polymer architectures are accessi- ble such as brush copolymers,[91,92] cyclic, and comb-copolymers. Besides the direct chemical modulation of the PNIPAM struc- ture, also the direct processing of PNIPAM-based materials can be performed to increase the sensitivity of PNIPAM or enable the monitoring of macroscopic properties as a read-out. Elec- trospinning (ES) is a unique and simple technique to prepare various functional and composite nanoﬁbers called electrospun nanoﬁbers featuring typical diameters of a few hundreds of nanometers. The small diameters of nanoﬁbers provide a high surface area-to-volume ratio, which makes them ideal for sens- ing applications. It also presents advantages like low cost, ﬂexible morphology tuning, and high-throughput continuous produc- tion. Compared to continuous thin ﬁlms, electrospun nanoﬁbers possess 1–2 orders of magnitude more surface area that facili- tates high sensitivity and rapid responses to external signals[93] Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (6 of 71) © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de such as pH, temperature, and metal ions.[94–98] Imprinted poly- mers prepared from the gel are another vast area of sensing for biomolecules [99,100] and organic molecules.[101] Various types of gels (hydrogel, microgel, and nanogel) with high mechanical and reusable properties were made via crosslinking with excellent sensing properties.[102–117] Composites oﬀer another attractive alternative for develop- ing PNIPAM-based sensors, as often the functionality of the composite is greater than the sum of its components. Compo- nents like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, gold nanoparti- cles (AuNPs), quantum dots, and electrospun nanoﬁbers have been used for preparing composites. Their properties were im- proved by immobilizing the thermoresponsive PNIPAM. CNTs are extensively used because of their high conductivity and de- sirable dispersibility. Two types of CNTs have been used: single- walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). SWCNTs are 1D conductors with all elec- trons moving in an atomic layer having surface atoms. Whereas MWCNTs consist of a complex structure with each carbon layer having diﬀerent chirality and electronic properties. They possess a large speciﬁc surface area, small diameter, and high surface en- ergy. Moreover, MWCNTs have great electrical conductivity, elec- trocatalytic activity, and adsorption performance, which is uti- lized to accelerate signal transmission, improve sensing capabil- ity, and sensor sensitivity. CNTs coated with PNIPAM have ac- ceptable biocompatibility, excellent water dispersibility, and solu- bility. Therefore, they are used as an ideal electrode material and widely utilized in electrochemical sensors.[118] Graphene is an al- lotrope of carbon consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a 2D honeycomb lattice. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), nanometer-sized graphene derivatives, show very interesting op- toelectronic properties due to quantum conﬁnement and edge eﬀects. Their tunable luminescent properties depend on their size, as well as the surrounding pH and the presence of metal ions, making them great candidates for a multi-sensing platform. Graphene oxide (GO) has a 2D, graphene-like structure with oxygen-containing functional groups such as epoxide, OH, and COOH. Due to this structure, GO contains good hydrophobicity, moderate conductivity, high chemical stability, and excellent elec- trochemical properties, and can act as a support for the deposi- tion of inorganic nanocatalysts or polymers. GO is specially used in the sensing ﬁeld to facilitate or mediate the charge/electron transfer between the electroactive species and the electrode sur- face. Surface properties and functionalities of GO can be explored by anchoring NPs and polymers via chemical and physical in- teractions, such as electrostatic, cycloaddition, hydrophobic, and 𝜋-𝜋 stacking interactions.[119] AuNPs have attracted immense at- tention because of their extraordinary electrical properties, opti- cal properties excellent size/shape control, biocompatibility, and novel plasmonic and catalytic properties. Therefore, the immo- bilization of PNIPAM on AuNPs improves the accessibility of their unique optical properties and can be used as excellent opti- cal sensors.[120–122] Recently, quantum dots (QDs) have been used as optical labels for biosensing events due to their size-controlled ﬂuorescence properties, high quantum yield, and stability against photobleaching over organic ﬂuorophores. Carbon dots (CDs) are one of the most popular QD among them. They are a class of 3D nanostructured materials that have the sp2 carbon hybridiza- tion and represent nanocrystalline graphite. They show various merits like excellent photostability, small size, biocompatibility, highly tunable photoluminescence (PL) property, up-conversion PL property, electrochemiluminescence, and chemical inertness. These characteristics make it an excellent material for sensing. Immobilization of PNIPAM onto CDs generated hybrid materi- als with both the properties of CD and PNIPAM whereby chem- ical signals could be converted into optical signals.[123–126] Given the widespread research, development, and application of PNIPAM-based sensors in the last decades, an up-to-date ac- count of PNIPAM-based sensor development will be presented in this review, starting from 2016. More speciﬁcally, this review will focus on the most recent developments in both physicochem- ical and biosensors (Figure 8), which will be complemented by a brief discussion of the structural features of the polymer. Finally, a summary and outlook into the development and application of sensors will be presented, with a particular focus on the remain- ing challenges in the successful application of PNIPAM-based platforms. 2. PNIPAM-Based Physiochemical Sensors 2.1. Temperature Sensors As PNIPAM possesses intrinsic thermoresponsive behavior in aqueous solutions, its concomitant use as a temperature sen- sor has been the most widely explored. Although widely ex- plored, one limitation is the often-limited temperature sens- ing window and resolution of PNIPAM sensors. The develop- ment of sensors with milli-degree temperature resolution en- ables the monitoring of several cellular processes, including gene expression, [127,128] tumor metabolism,[129] and pathogenesis of diseases.[130] In other cases, changes in intracellular temperature can aﬀect various critical cellular functions, such as mass trans- port, energy conversion, signal transduction, cell metabolism, di- vision, and cell death. So intracellular temperature monitoring could provide information regarding the underlying causes of diseases and, oﬀer diagnostic and therapeutic methods for clini- cal applications. [131–134] Furthermore, the utilization of body tem- perature in the diagnosis of diseases or normal biological pro- cesses, such as the menstrual cycle,[135] has prompted the ex- ploration of compact and wearable sensors. Temperature sen- sors are also applicable for many non-biological processes like oil mining,[136] radiators in vehicles,[137] glass industries,[138] chemi- cal industries,[139] and in integrated circuits.[140] 2.1.1. Composite-Based Temperature Sensors To address some of these issues, PNIPAM-based polymers have been combined with photonic materials as they provide an easy- to-understand read-out. A recent example of a photonic sensor can be found in the work of Huang et al., who synthesized PNI- PAM dip-coated silica nanoﬁbers by the electrostatic interaction of an amino group of modiﬁed PNIPAM with the acidic silanol groups on the surface of the nanoﬁbers (Figure 9). [141] From the phase transition of PNIPAM from a hydrated to a dehydrated state, the authors could monitor the surface refractive index (sRI) of the ﬁbers as a function of temperature. Initially, the ﬁbers dis- played a sRI close to that of water (T < LCST). However, as the Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (7 of 71) © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de Figure 8. Schematic representation of the PNIPAM-based physicochemical and biosensors. temperature rose a dehydrated polymer ﬁlm formed on the ﬁber surface, resulting in a large shift in sRI. In this fashion, a temper- ature resolution up to millidegrees could be reached in the range of body temperature 35–42 °C, while also improving the sensitiv- ity by 2 orders of magnitude (18.74 nm °C−1) compared to typical radiation-based thermometry. Besides sRI, other characteristics of the sensor can be moni- tored as well. For example, Oh et al. developed a skin-attachable thermal sensor, which utilized electrical resistance as a mea- surable output to monitor temperature. For this purpose, they developed an octopus-mimicking microstructure adhesive that was modiﬁed with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), followed by de- position of an Au ﬁlm. [142] Then a PEDOT:PSS/CNT compos- ite spin-coated with PNIPAM was added on top of the adhe- sive ﬁlm to fabricate the sensor (Figure 10)withPDMSasthe insulating layer and PEDOT:PSS/CNT as the conducting layer. As the temperature rises, the volume of PNIPAM shrinks, re- sulting in a dense percolation network of PEDOT:PSS/CNT and, as a result, a reduction in electrical resistance. With the de- crease of temperature, the opposite phenomenon occurs, i.e., the volume of PNIPAM increases, thus loosening the percola- tion network of PEDOT:PSS/CNT which causes increases in the electrical resistance. This system showed a high thermal sen- sitivity of 2.6% °C−1 between 25 °Cand 40 °C with a LOD of 0.5 °C. Also, Rullyani et al. explored the use of PNIPAM in an electri- cal sensor recently. They fabricated an organic thin-ﬁlm transis- tor (OTFT) that served as a temperature sensor with a detection range of 30–45 °C. [143] This transistor was synthesized by spin- coating a solution of carboxylic acid terminated PNIPAM on an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate, whereby the PNI- PAM functioned as the gate dielectric. Next, a metal-insulator- metal (MIM) structure of Au/pentacene/Au was deposited on the PNIPAM layer, whereby the pentacene functioned as a semicon- ductor (Figure 11). The capacitance of the ITO/ PNIPAM/Au sys- tem depended on the PNIPAM thickness. The thickness of PNI- PAM ﬁlm reduced with increasing temperature due to its phase transition, which in turn increased the conductance. So, the tem- perature measurement was done by measuring the value of the resistive current between the drain and source (IDS), i.e., both Au constructs which increased from an initial value of −5.7 μAat30 °C to a ﬁnal value of −9.8 μAat45 °C. Another approach for developing thermal (bio)sensors with high sensitivity, is the combination of stimuli-responsive poly- mers with inorganic NPs. These NPs can be used as an excel- lent probe for sensing due to their unique optical properties Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (8 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

AuNPs, in particular, have already demonstrated invalu- able for sensing, imaging, and drug delivery. [144] By applying a smart polymer coating, AuNPs can sense external stimuli, includ- ing temperature, pH, and light irradiation. When the AuNP sur- face is decorated with stimuli-responsive polymers, a given stim- uli can induce optical property changes in the AuNP. In one ex- ample, Maji et al. designed a colorimetric temperature sensor by coating AuNPs with a thermoresponsive PNIPAM shell. [145] The polymer was prepared by RAFT polymerization using methyl 2- (((butylthio)carbonothioyl)thio)propanoate (MBTTC) as a chain transfer agent (CTA), and the AuNPs were functionalized via a “grafting to” approach, which comprised the exchange of the weakly bound citrate for the polymer-bound trithiocarbonate group. The authors showed that the sensing mechanism of the AuNPs depended on the interparticle association which was con- trolled by temperature and salt concentration. At a ﬁxed salt con- centration (100 × 10 −3 m NaCl), heating of the AuNPs led to the shift from a red solution (30 °C) to a purple-blue solution (45 °C), whereby the shift was attributed to interparticle association and dissociation (Figure 12). Moreover, the process was shown to be reversible, and the system exhibited temperature sensing in the range of 28–42 °C for NaCl and 30–44 °C for NaSCN. Further- more, the authors also hypothesized that the sensitivity of the smart sensor may change as the polymer chain length increases. Similarly, Lei and co-workers also explored the use PNIPAM dec- orated AuNPs for temperature sensing.[146] They prepared PNI- PAM via RAFT and aminolyzed the trithiocarbonate end-group to a thiol to facilitate the “grafting to” the AuNPs. With the increase of temperature, the aggregation of NPs occurred due to the col- lapse of PNIPAM accompanied by a color change to purple in the presence of 50 × 10 −3 m NaCl due to red-shifting of the plas- mon peak of PNIPAM–AuNPs (Figure 13). Here, salt was added to screen the electrostatic interactions and temperatures in the range of 25–50 °C could be detected. A similar “grafting to” approach was utilized by Liu et al., who conjugated thiolated PNIPAM to AuNPs of various shapes, viz. nanospheres (AuNSs), gold nanorods (AuNRs), and gold nanobipyramids (AuNBPs) to understand the eﬀects of plas- monic resonance modes on sensing performances. [147] Their systems displayed a red-shift of the absorbance peak in the temperature range of 25–34 °C, which was attributed to an increasing refractive index because of polymer dehydration from the hydrophilic–hydrophobic phase transition. In the tempera- ture range of 34–50 °C, a linear decrease in the longitudinal res- onance peak intensity occurred due to a chemical damping eﬀect caused by the PNIPAM chains collapsing on the particle surfaces. To avoid NP aggregation, the authors did not employ salt in this experiment, instead relied on diﬀerent shapes of NP, thus en- abling the ﬁrst observation of, a linear correlation between the resonance peak shift and the temperature. The researchers then applied three well-known machine learning techniques to the ob- tained absorption data, namely random forest regression (RF), gradient boosting regression (GB), and adaptive boosting regres- sion (AB), to estimate the temperature from the absorbance of NP solution.[148] In addition to solutions of PNIPAM-coated AuNPs, Choe et al. explored the embedding of AuNPs in PNIPAM- based microgels.[149] More speciﬁcally, PNIPAM micro- gels were prepared with acrylamide (AAm) using N,N’- methylenebisacrylamide (MBAM) as a crosslinker and a plasmonic microgel was prepared by mixing microgels with AuNP solution. Due to the thermally induced aggregation of PNIPAM chains, the AuNPs on the PNIPAM microgels dis- played loosely packed structures at 24 °C and densely packed assemblies at 50 °C, resulting in uncoupled and coupled plas- mon modes at 24 °Cand 50 °C, respectively. Therefore, large color changes could be thermally induced by switching from un- couple to couple plasmonic mode of the AuNPs (Figure 14). The authors also demonstrated smart colorimetric array patches with varying color transition temperatures, which displayed a wide temperature-detection range (29‒40 °C) and high resolution (0.2 °C). 2.1.2. Hydrogel-Based Temperature Sensors Besides composites, PNIPAM-based hydrogels can be used as another wearable temperature sensing device, as demonstrated by Feng et al., relying on ionic hydrogels. They designed their system to display excellent conductivity, mechanical tolerance, and rapid recoverability.[150] Their hydrogel was prepared from a multi-component mixture containing polyvinylalcohol (PVA), polyacrylic acid (PAA), and AAm monomers to which graphene oxide (GO) and Fe 3+ were added, followed by the addition of NI- PAM, and MBAM as a crosslinker. With PNIPAM-AAm hydro- gel PVA−GO, PVA−GO/PAA−Fe3+, and PNIPAM−AAm/Fe 3+ conductive hydrogels were synthesized by a two-step polymer- ization method (Figure 15a) where ﬁrst chain growth polymer- ization of AAm was completed followed by hydrogel formation with NIPAM. The hydrogels were subsequently utilized as ionic strain sensors that displayed temperature-dependent conductiv- ity which depended on the free ion’s mobility and their shut- tle distance. At low temperatures, the mobility of free ions in Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (10 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

Nevertheless, with increasing temperature ionic mobil- ity was enhanced, causing increasing conductivity of hydrogels (Figure 15b). Besides temperature sensors, this material can also be used as a wearable strain sensor. Liu et al. explored the use of double network (DN) hydrogels and applied their mechanical properties for the development of a temperature sensor. [151] A DN hydrogel has properties like fracture toughness, frac- ture tensile stress, and fracture tensile strain. In this report, DN hydrogels were prepared from chemically reduced GO and Figure 14.

GO was re- duced to reduced GO by CMC via the amidation reaction, which improved the conductivity of the fabricated hydrogels. The in- crease in temperature caused the deswelling of the continuous layer structure of GO and the tight DN structure of PNIPAM im- proved the continuous electronic transmission and resulted in decreased resistance. The authors observed a reproducible change in resistance in the range of 25–60 °C. In addition to temperature sensing, it can also measure strain, as mentioned in the pressure sensing sec- tion. A temperature-alerting hydrogel was developed by Wang and co-workers by utilizing an electrically conductive hydrogel, whereby the sensor relied on the shrinking and swelling of the hydrogel. [152] Here a PNIPAM hydrogel was prepared with crosslinker double bond end-capped Pluronic F127 (F127DA) and electrically conductive polyaniline (PANI) was synthesized with phytic acid as a crosslinker. By mechanically interlocking these two hydrogels, temperature changes could be detected from hydrogel shrinking. At 20 °C, the F-PNIPAM/PANI hydrogel tightly contacted the two copper electrodes, which closed an elec- trical circuit. When the temperature increased to 50 °C, a ther- mally induced chain collapse of PNIPAM occurred, and as a con- sequence the hydrogel shrank, resulting in a loss of contact be- tween the electrodes and disconnection of the circuit with vary- ing resistance. The authors also demonstrated that the hydrogel in this conﬁguration could be used to detect and quantify strain. Similarly, Zhan et al. also explored the incorporation of PNIPAM-based conducting hydrogels in electrical circuits. Their hydrogel was a composite of PNIPAM/carboxymethyl chi- tosan (CMCS)/MWCNT/PANI, which featured highly porous structures. [153] In the ﬁrst step, the PNIPAM/CMCS/ MWCNT hydrogel was synthesized by a one-pot sol-gel synthesis, which was followed by the incorporation of an aniline monomer through noncovalent interactions between the active functional groups of the CMCS and MWCNT chains and the hydrogen atoms of the aniline monomers. Finally, the polymerization of the aniline monomer was initiated by ammonium persulfate (APS) in the presence of HCl. The hydrogel was designed in such a way that the conductivity of the hydrogel gradually reduced with increasing temperature in the range of 20 °Cto50 °C due to changes in the swelling state and microstructure of the hydrogel (Figure 17). Besides measuring temperature, their system was also capable of measuring pressure and pH, which we describe separately in the pressure and pH sensing section. Stop-ﬂow lithography is another method for creating unique thermal hydrogel sensors. This technique was applied by Wang et al. to synthesize a Y-shaped double-layered hydrogel. [154] This Y- shaped hydrogel was synthesized in a PDMS microﬂuidic chan- nel to generate an angle between the hydrogel layers. The two- layered structure features a PNIPAM poor and rich side, thus pro- viding a distinct thermal response for each layer. Upon heating, a stronger deformation of the PNIPAM-rich side occurs, result- ing in a bent structure (Figure 18). Therefore, the bending angle can be utilized to accurately measure the temperature within the range of 16–55 °C. Another hydrogel thermosensor was developed by Zhang et al., who modiﬁed PNIPAM hydrogel by grafting it onto in- dividual nanodiamond (NDs) to form a shell. Then magnetic Ni nanoparticles (Ni MNPs) were added to the hydrogel. [155] (Figure 19). With the increase in temperature, the hydrogel col- lapsed, which caused a sharp decrease in the distance between the NDs and MNPs, and a large change in the magnetic ﬁeld was observed via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Umar et al. made creative use of optical hydrogels where Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (12 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

Schematic representation of three hydrogels prepared by Liu et al., where the rightmost depicts the functional hydrogel thermosensor.[151] they fabricated MIM optical cavities with insulating nanolay- ers of thermoresponsive copolymer.[156] For their purpose, a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-r-glycidyl methacrylate) [P(NIPAM- r-GMA)] was produced by free-radical polymerization with two photosensitive crosslinker bis(2-nitrobenzyl)methylenebis(4,1- phenylene)- dicarbamate (BL) and bis(2-nitrobenzyl)hexane-1,6- diyldicarbamate (HL). The MIM cavities were prepared by sandwiching the insula- tor between two Ag nanolayers based on a Fabry−Perot etalon. Upon increasing temperature, the PNIPAM part in the hydrogel layer collapsed, causing a decrease in wavelength. In this fashion, the device could detect temperatures in the range of 19–30 °Cof locally laser-heated protein particles and a chicken breast tissue sample. In addition, they demonstrated that the same phenom- ena may be exploited to detect alcohol concentration in food and biological samples. A photonic sensor formed by a hydrogel was designed by Kye et al., where they introduced a photonic gel using 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as a hydrogel building block, and 4- acryloyl morpholine (ACMO) and NIPAM as thermoresponsive monomers (Figure 20).[157] ACMO unit has higher LCST (around 88 °C) and the opal-templated photonic gel shows a periodic mod- ulation of the refractive indices within the gel, and an appropri- ate periodic distance results in a speciﬁc color due to the Bragg diﬀraction from the periodic inverse opal (IO) structure. The tem- perature in the range of 10–80 °C can be detected using this gel. Another technique that can be used to monitor the temperature- dependent coil-to-globule transition of PNIPAM is particle im- age velocimetry (PIV). This technique relies on an experimental method that uses microscale particles as minimally invasive trac- ers to measure the velocity of a ﬂuid ﬂow. Barbieri and co-workers explored the use of PNIPAM hydro- gels to develop PIV-based thermosensors.[158] An interpenetrated polymer network (IPN) was designed with the NIPAM monomer followed by the addition of alginate to a PNIPAM solution and coated with chitosan after adding Nile red (NR)-alginate solution into PNIPAM hydrogel (Figure 21). Chitosan was added to ad- just the particle permeability. Upon increase of temperature due to coil to globule transition, the polarity of PNIPAM decreased which caused the enhancement of ﬂuorescence intensity of the polarity-sensitive dye up to 20 times compared to the original emission. The fabricated composites detected temperatures in the range of 29–41 °C. Another PIV-based system was reported by Cellini et al.[159] For this purpose, they synthesized a copolymer of PNIPAM which incorporated a polarity-sensitive ﬂuorescent dye, viz. 4-(2-acryloyloxyethylamino)−7-nitro2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD- AE). The copolymer was then incorporated into a commer- cial PDMS matrix to enable PIV. Their system displayed a temperature-dependent increase in ﬂuorescence as a result of the reduction of the micro-environmental polarity around ﬂu- orescent units from the PNIPAM chain. In addition, their Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (13 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

A nanogel thermometer ca- pable of monitoring temperature inside living cells was devel- oped by Uchiyama et al. 160 For this, they designed a cationic structure with low toxicity using a new cationic radical initia- tor, 2,2′-azobis-[2-(1,3-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-3-ium- 2-yl)]propane triﬂate (ADIP), which helped to show excellent abil- ity to enter living mammalian cells in a short incubation period. With this radical initiator, a nanogel was produced by copoly- merization of NIPAM, an MBAM crosslinker, and a DBThD- AA (oxygen atom of the 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole moiety in DBD- AA (N-{2-[(7-N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl)−2,1,3-benzoxadiazol- 4-yl](methyl) amino}ethyl-N-methylacrylamide) was replaced with a sulfur) as the environment-sensitive ﬂuorescent unit (Figure 22). This nanogel displayed increasing ﬂuorescence in- tensity as a function of temperature due to the lowering of the polarity in the immediate environment of the dye. Therefore, this nanogel could quantify temperature with a sensitivity of 0.02– 0.84 °C in the range of 20–40 °C. The authors demonstrated the use of this nanogel for intracellular thermal imaging in HeLa (hu- man epithelial carcinoma) cells. Adv. Funct.

Copolymer-Based Temperature Sensors In addition to gels, PNIPAM (co)polymers can be processed by electrospinning to obtain nanoﬁbers, which are ideal for sensing applications due to their porous nature and high surface area. In this fashion, the interaction between the sensor and analytes can be maximized and the response occurs with a minimal time lag. A recent example of such a system can be found in the work of Chen et al., who developed an ES nanoﬁber thermo-sensor from aP(NIPAM-co-NMA-co-RhBN2AM) polymer prepared through free radical polymerization. [161] At a ﬁxed Hg 2+ concentration (10 −3 m) with the increase in temperature, the diameter of the ﬁber decreased resulting in aggregated and dense Rh-chelated Hg 2+ moieties which resulted in the enhancement of ﬂuores- cence intensity (Figure 23). With the increase of temperature from 27 °Cto55 °C the wavelength of photoluminescent spectra (𝜆PL, max) also increased. Besides temperature, this ES nanoﬁber could also detect changes in Hg 2+ concentration and pH. Block-copolymers also present a useful architecture for the synthesis of highly sensitive PNIPAM-based sensors. Such a sys- tem was recently reported by Qiao et al.[162] Whereby a block- copolymer of NIPAM and 4-vinylphenyl boronic acid (VPBA) was prepared via RAFT polymerization. In this conﬁguration, the VPBA-block serves as the chemical anchor for curcumin via boronate ester formation, thus allowing its immobilization on a PNIPAM-VPBA framework (PNIPAM-VPBA-C) (Figure 24). In a subsequent step, Fluo-4 AM (FAM) was added to PNIPAM- VPBA-C unit to prepare PNIPAM-VPBA-C-FAM. The obtained block-copolymer composite relied on the donor–acceptor intra- molecular charge transfer between curcumin and the ﬂuores- cent dye as a reporter event, leading to increasing ﬂuorescence properties upon the temperature-induced collapse of PNIPAM. In this fashion, the temperature in the range of 30–42 °Ccould be measured in HeLa cells. Additionally, the authors demon- strated that this system could detect Ca 2+ concentration down to 5.7 × 10 −6 m. An alternative strategy to boost thermal resolution focuses on lanthanide-based compounds, which allow for luminescence nanothermometry through a forbidden 4f–4f transition. One ma- jor downside of this approach is the relatively weak absorbance associated with the 4f–4f transition. In order to augment the per- formance of lanthanide-based materials, conjugation of PNIPAM has been shown to be a promising approach to develop highly sensitive nanothermometers. Such a nanothermometer was de- veloped by Zhang et al., who synthesized a copolymer via the free radical copolymerization of NIPAM, (3-acrylamidopropyl) trimethylammonium (APTMA), and polymerizable Ir(III) and Eu(III) complexes. [163] The diﬀerent components functioned as a thermo-responsive unit, a water-soluble endocytosis-promoting unit, a responsive phosphorescent luminophore, and a forbidden 4f–4f transition monitoring unit, respectively. When the polymer was heated from 20 °Cto42 °C, the PNIPAM chain became hy- drophobic, thus decreasing the polarity around the Ir(III) com- plexes, which consequently enhanced their radiative transition (Figure 25). However, due to the forbidden 4f–4f transition, the luminescence intensity from the Eu(III) complexes remained un- changed. This result indicated that this system can image the temperature inside HeLa cells and zebraﬁsh larvae using ratio- metric and phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Another nanothermometer based on a trivalent lanthanide (LnIII = Tb and/or Eu) complex was reported by Sobrinho et al. [164] In their example, the lanthanide was incorporated by postpolymerization modiﬁcation, through its chelation to a coordinating comonomer, viz. 4-(allyloxy)dipicolinic acid (dpal). The authors copolymerized this monomer with NIPAM as a thermoresponsive unit, MBAM as a crosslinker to obtain copolymeric NPs via emulsion polymerization. When these lanthanide-containing NPs were subjected to increasing tem- peratures, the coil to globule transition of PNIPAM caused the expulsion of water molecules from the NP interior (Figure 26). In the dehydrated interior, the water molecules in the ﬁrst Ln(III) coordination sphere were replaced by weak chemical interactions with carbonyl groups available in the polymer chains, which in turn decreased the non-radiative pathways that lead to the emission quenching. In this fashion, the temperature in the range of 30–50 °C could be detected in a reversible manner, which was demonstrated for ﬁve consecutive cycles. Alterna- tive to heavy metals, organic dyes can also be incorporated in the thermoresponsive polymer structure, whereby properties such as absorption intensity, wavelength, ﬂuorescence lifetime, solvatochromism, and other characteristics can be monitored to report temperature changes. Gong et al. exploited these features to develop a polymer capable of detecting tempera- tures in the range of 37–42 °C inside living cells. Towards this end, a copolymer of P(NIPAM-co-BODIPY-AA) was prepared via RAFT polymerization, whereby the BODIPY-AA (5-thiol allyl-3-phenylamino-8-phenyl-4,4-diﬂuoro-4-bora3a,4a-diaza-s- indacene) provides polarity-dependent ﬂuorescence.[165] Upon heating, the polarity of the polymer decreased, resulting in the formation of hydrophobic aggregates, which increased the ﬂuorescence of the dye (Figure 27). In addition to the direct use of dyes and assessing their solva- tochromic eﬀects, the distance between dye pairs can be moni- tored by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). This process relies on the energy transfer of an excited donor dye to a suit- able acceptor dye, which results in ﬂuorescence of the acceptor dye. FRET is therefore a very sensitive technique that enables the probing of inter- and intramolecular distances. In addition, the FRET process is capable of providing multicolor ﬂuorescence by Adv.

Synthesis of the hydrogel layer outside ND and followed by addition of Ni MNPs.[155] selecting suitable acceptor and donor dye pairs. Hence, the FRET process is an attractive photophysical phenomenon for the devel- opment of thermometers with high sensitivity. A recent example can be found in the work of Lee et al., who introduced the FRET donor nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) and FRET acceptor spiropyran (SP) dyes in a P(NIPAM-NBD) nanogel via emulsion copolymerization followed by the forma- tion of P(NIPAM-NBD-SP) nanogels with adding SP-COOH to P(NIPAM-NBD). [166] Upon UV radiation ring-closed weakly ﬂuorescent SP moiety changes into the ring-opened coral-red merocyanine (MC) moieties, resulting in light-pink ﬂuorescent nanogels. With the increase of temperature, the distance between donor and acceptor moieties decreases which causes enhanced FRET with coral-red ﬂuorescence (Figure 28). Another FRET-based temperature sensor was reported by Kong et al. [167] They synthesized a PNIPAM copolymer via RAFT, which contained rhodamine 6G as the acceptor dye, while a 1,8-naphthalimide moiety featuring a piperazine was chosen as the donor dye. Their system exploited the thermoresponsive be- havior of PNIPAM to modulate the distance between the 1,8- naphthalimide and rhodamine 6G moieties as a function of tem- perature. As the temperature increased, the distance between Figure 20. The structure of the hydrogel gel utilized by Kye et al. with N,N’-methylenebis(acrylamide) (MBAM) as cross-linker.[157] Adv. Funct.

Besides temperature sensing, the authors also demon- strated the utility of their system as a Fe3+ and pH sensor which will be discussed in the respective sections. Finally, temperature sensors can also be prepared by incorporating polarity-sensitive monomers into the polymeric chain. In this context, Uchiyama et al. designed the ﬂuorescent 8- methoxy-2-oxo-2H-benzo[g]chromen-4-yl)methyl acrylate (MBC- AE) monomer and formed a P(NIPAM-co-MBC-AE) copolymer via free radical polymerization, which displayed enhanced ﬂu- orescence in polar environments. Upon heating, the ﬂuores- cence intensity gradually decreased allowing facile read-out of the temperature. Unfortunately, the ester in the MBC-AE units was found to be susceptible to hydrolysis under neutral and ba- sic conditions, hampering its reversibility, as the polar sensi- tivity was lost once the dye was cleaved from the polymer.[168] To address these shortcomings, they synthesized the MBC-AA monomer, whereby the amide provides higher hydrolytic sta- bility, and performed a random copolymerization with NIPAM to yield P(NIPAM-co-MBC-AA). [169] The newly obtained copoly- mer exhibited stronger ﬂuorescence at longer wavelengths in po- lar solvents, whilst the polarity-dependent ﬂuorescence behavior could be maintained. This was demonstrated by its excellent re- producibility over various cycles, allowing the reproducible mon- itoring of temperature between 30 and 40 °C. As a result, a variety of PNIPAM-based temperature sensors can be designed using composites, nanomaterials, and PNI- PAM copolymers. The structural design is suitable not only for the design of temperature sensors, but also for multi-functional chemosensors. The majority of the covered examples feature a robust temperature response in the range of 20 °Cto50 °C, and with proper design, materials can be developed to monitor bio- logical processes inside cells. Although robust temperature sen- sors have been reported, in many examples the sensitivity of the sensors is not demonstrated which is an important feature of the sensors. From the covered examples it is clear that the incorpora- tion of ﬂuorescent dyes or other optically active moieties allows for the development of sensors with high sensitivity down to a few hundredths of a degree Celsius with a response time of about 160 s. 2.2. pH Sensors pH plays an important role in many ﬁelds of science and en- gineering and is an important indicator of physiological and metabolic processes. Therefore, quantitative pH measurements are a useful tool in cellular analysis or diagnostics, i.e., the mon- itoring of the pH of wound ﬂuid can provide information on the healing process, as well as septic conditions. [170] pH-responsive polymers are a group of stimuli-responsive polymers which undergo structural changes and properties such as surface activity, chain conformation, solubility, and conﬁguration in response to solution pH.[171] Polymer-based pH sensors are attractive due to their low cost of production and high sensitivity in relatively small volumes.

Several hydrogels containing acrylic acid have been prepared to detect pH, relying on the diﬀerential swelling be- havior as a function of the COOH protonation degree.[172,173] Besides such macroscopic hydrogels, similar microgels have been incorporated into etalons-based pH sensors.[110,111] In addition, a ﬂuorescence dye can be combined with acrylic acid to facilitate easy interpretation of the colorimetric sen- sor output. [174] Also, pH-responsive ﬂuorescent dyes, such as N-{2-[(7-N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl)−2,1,3-benzoxadiazol- 4-yl]- (methyl)amino}ethyl-N-methylacrylamide (DBD- AA),[175] dicyano-methylene-4H-pyran,[71] benzaxazole,[94,176] rhodamine unit, [177] PNME (combination of 2-(6-(4- (2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl)−1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo- [de] isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)ethyl methacrylate with NIPAM), [69] CPMA ((Z)−4-(1-cyano-2-(4-(dimethylamino) phenyl)vinyl)phenylmethylacrylate)[178] can be incorporated to facilitate the read-out without the need for acrylic acid. Also, in the context of dye-functionalized polymers, the AIEE (aggregation-induced enhanced emission) phenomenon can be exploited for pH detection.[179] Adv. Funct.

Moreover, NPs have been incorporated to prepare pH sensors.[180] Silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) are extensively fea- tured due to their easy preparation and bright ﬂuores- cence. Lu et al. explored their use to develop a pH sen- sor with a temperature-responsive copolymer ligand (CPL). [181] The copolymer PNIPAM-co-5-(2-methacryloylethyloxymethyl)-8- quinolinol (MQ) was synthesized via free radical copolymeriza- tion (Figure 29). Then modiﬁcation with AgNCs was performed to prepare CPL-AgNCs. At pH less than 3, no ﬂuorescence was observed while with further increase of pH, the ﬂuorescence in- tensity was found to be increased. Here, introduction of PNIPAM made the polymer water-soluble. The system exhibited a pH de- tection range 3.04–5.25. As mentioned previously,[153] the swelling and deswelling characteristics of PNIPAM/CMCS/MWCNT/PANI hydrogels en- abled temperature monitoring through the related changes in conductivity. The same system could also be used to monitor pH, as the conductivity of the hydrogel increases with decreasing pH due to the protonation of PANI. In this fashion, the pH could be monitored in between 2 and 12. Moreover, the FRET-based thermosensor of Kong et al. could be used to monitor pH.[167] The spirolactam rings present in the R6GEM units of the copolymer undergo ring-opening in acidic conditions, which results in characteristic absorption and emis- sion bands (Figure 30).

Another example is a rhodamine-based pH sen- sor made from electrospun PNIPAM nanoﬁber.[161] As reported earlier, without mercury ions H+ also induced the RhBN2AM to transform from its non-ﬂuorescent spirocyclic form into its opened cyclic form resulting in enhanced ﬂuorescence. Here also a pH in the range 2–7 could be detected. Similar to the previ- ous example, heating caused the condensation of the PNIPAM chain and reduction of rhodamine-rhodamine distance which Figure 28. a) Preparation of nanogel, b) Temperature sensing mechanism using FRET mechanism.

The polymer PNIPAM is thermoresponsive, consequently, PNIPAM cannot serve as a pH sensor on its own. Usually, other pH responsive units are added in order to facilitate pH readout. These pH-responsive moieties allow pH measurements in both basic and acidic ranges, making it a useful tool for proton de- tection with a response time of ≈12 s. Since protonation is sim- ply diﬀusion-limited, quicker responses for pH is expected rel- ative to temperature. Temperature changes, however, can have an impact on pH sensitivity, aﬀecting the chemical equilibrium of the system, absorbing additional heat and producing protons, which lower pH in the solution as a function of increasing tem- perature. Therefore sensors that rely on the temperature-induced phase transition/separation behavior of PNIPAM in their sens- ing mechanism could have limitations with accuracy of the pH measurement. 2.3. Analyte Sensing An analyte is a component or a chemical species that is of inter- est in an analytical procedure. Analyte sensing can be utilized for, e.g., disease monitoring, drug discovery, and detection of pollu- tants. Analytes such as metal ions and salts are discussed in this part. 2.3.1. Metal Ion Sensing Heavy metal ions have recently received a lot of attention since they are a signiﬁcant health hazard. Because of their poor biodegradation and long-term persistence in the environment, they have the propensity to bioaccumulate, presenting an in- creasing risk to organisms higher up the food chain. Mercury is one of the most notorious pollutants among the heavy metal Figure 30. Change of absorption and emission property in presence of H+.[167] Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (22 of 71) © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de ions and is especially known for its eﬀective bioaccumulation which can cause permanent damage in the central nervous and endocrine systems. [182,183] Another well-known heavy metal is lead, which is commonly found in industrial wastewater be- cause of its extensive use in facilities such as waste incinerators, smelteries, battery manufacturing plants, and printed circuit board factories.[184] It accumulates in the human body through water or food intake and can cause neurotoxicity, kidney dys- function, and several immunological eﬀects, and is particularly harmful to children concerning intellectual development. [185,186] Besides these well-known heavy metals, several others, (such as copper, zinc, and iron) are known to play important physiolog- ical roles, though overexposure or excess of these heavy met- als can lead to several diseases and disorders. Therefore, gov- ernmental agencies around the world have tried to limit envi- ronmental exposure to these metals by deﬁning safe limits for drinking water and food contaminants. [187] Hence selective de- tection of metal ions is of paramount importance for assessing water pollution, eliminating environmental hazards and their oc- currence in biological systems. Most common detection tech- niques, viz. atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, and various electrochemical meth- ods typically require large, expensive instruments and associated infrastructure.[188–192] Alternatively, ﬂuorescent sensors based on acridine-based dyes can also detect heavy metal ions, though the poor water solubility of these dyes makes them unsuitable for de- tecting ions in water.[193–196] Therefore, there exists a need for an economic, light-weight, water-soluble sensor that allows easy de- tection, quantiﬁcation, and interpretation of its output. Polymer- based sensors are ideally suited for this purpose as their chemical structure can be adjusted to modulate sensitivity, selectivity, in ad- dition to presenting small, biocompatible, yet inexpensive mate- rials for sensor development. Also, for metal ion sensing, the coil to globule phase transition has been exploited for developing sen- sors. Therefore, it is no surprise that PNIPAM has been promi- nently featured in such applications, though for these applica- tions the incorporation of sensing moieties in the polymer struc- ture is typically required. Alternatively, PNIPAM has also been incorporated in composite materials to facilitate detection. A ma- jor advantage of these systems is that they can be used repeatedly with minimal loss of function due to the reversible phase tran- sition behavior. Some of the systems that will be outlined below rely on copolymer structures of metal-sensing monomers such as rhodamine derivatives, naphthylamide derivatives, thiourea, CdSe/ZnS QDs which simultaneously detect metal (e.g., Hg) and exhibited ﬂuorescence deviation in presence of metal ions. Rhodamine-based chemosensors are widely used due to their excellent photophysical properties, viz. high ﬂuores- cence quantum yield, a broad range of absorption and emis- sion wavelengths, and large absorption coeﬃcients. Unfortu- nately, rhodamine derivatives typically display poor water sol- ubility, and therefore conjugation to PNIPAM has been ex- plored to facilitate their application in the sensing of metal ions in aqueous and biological media. Deng et al. utilized this strategy to develop a Hg 2+ sensor, and incorporated a N- tripodal rhodamine 6G (RD) dye via aminolysis of a poly(N- isopropylacrylamide-co-N-acryloxysuccinimide [poly(NIPAM-co- NASI)] to prepare poly(NIPAM-co-RD) copolymer.[197] In pres- ence of Hg 2+, ring-opening of the rhodamine units occurs, whereby the solution changed from colorless to pink, in addition to an enhancement in ﬂuorescence properties (Figure 31). Af- ter exposure to Hg2+, the sensing property of their system could be recovered by treatment with sulﬁde ions in heating condi- tions as heating condition polymer collapsed and Hg2+ was sep- arated from polymer chain. The polymer selectively sensed Hg2+ in mineral water and tap water in the presence of cations such as K+,Na +,Ca 2+,Ba 2+,Cd 2+,Co 2+,Cu2+,Fe 2+,Mn2+,Ni 2+,Pb 2+, Zn2+,Al 3+,Fe 3+,Cr3+ with a LOD as low as 2.25×10 −8 m. Another rhodamine-based Hg2+ sensor was reported by Chen et al. [161] (in the temperature sensing section we elaborated the synthesis). The moiety is primarily present in the non- ﬂuorescent, less colored spirocyclic form in absence of Hg2+. Upon exposure to Hg 2+ the spirolactam ring-opens result- ing in bright pink ﬂuorescence (Figure 32). Above the LCST, the thermally induced aggregation of PNIPAM decreases the rhodamine–rhodamine distance, thus enhancing ﬂuorescence and sensitivity. The ﬁber can sense 10−3 mHg 2+. Another type of Hg 2+ sensing mechanism was explored by Liang et al.[198] They prepared composite nanoﬁbers via electrospinning blends of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-(N- methylolacrylamide)-co-(acrylic acid) [poly(NIPAM-co-NMA-co- AA)], the ﬂuorescent probe 1-benzoyl-3-[2-(2-allyl-1,3-dioxo- 2,3-dihydro-1Hbenzo[de] isoquinolin-6-ylamino)-ethyl]-thiourea (BNPTU), and magnetite NPs on a single-capillary spinneret. The incorporated 1,8-naphthalimide-based dye served as a colorimet- ric indicator to selectively detect Hg 2+, relying on the transfor- mation of the BNPTU thiourea moiety to an imidazoline moiety. This transformation causes a signiﬁcant reduction in electron de- localization within the ﬂuorophore resulting in a bathochromic shift from green to blue emission (Figure 33). The “oﬀ” state of the sensor was exhibited at a higher temperature when PNIPAM was collapsed, which blocked the absorption of incident light by the BNPTU moiety with Hg 2+ resulting in a decrease of PL in- tensity. This system exhibited sensitivity up to 10−3 m with sen- sitivity over other heavy metal ions including Co2+,Ni2+,Pb 2+, Zn2+,Mg 2+,Cu2+,Fe 2+,and Cd2+. Zhu et al. developed a multi- component system for detecting both Hg2+ and Cu2+ ions.[199] The ﬁrst component consisted of an azobenzene (AZO)- terminated PNIPAM-b-(PS-co-MQ) block-copolymer, which was synthesized by RAFT polymerization. These polymers were then complexed with previously prepared CdSe/ZnS QDs, which re- sulted in self-assembled structures presenting the AZO moiety on their surface. In a subsequent step, the AZO moieties were complexed via host-guest chemistry with 𝛽-cyclodextrin (𝛽-CD). This water-soluble composite displayed the characteristic ﬂuores- cence peaks of both CDs and CdSe/ZnS QDs in the absence of metal ions. With the addition of Hg 2+ and Cu2+ eﬃcient charge transfer between the metal ions, QDs and CDs takes place, re- sulting in ﬂuorescence quenching (Figure 34). The system exhib- ited LODs down to 1.6 × 10−6 and 2.74 × 10 −6 mfor Hg 2+,Cu2+, respectively. In addition to Hg 2+,Pb 2+ is a hazardous metal. To en- able its eﬃcient detection macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers have been used. Crown ethers, in particular, display the ability to chelate cations (metal ions and organic molecules), as long as they ﬁt inside the crown ether cavity. This size discrimination in the formation of “host-guest” complexes can therefore be exploited to capture and detect ions of Adv. Funct.

Lin et al. utilized this strategy to develop a Pb2+ detect- ing microchip based on a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo- 18-crown-6-acrylamide) [P(NIPAM-co-B18C6Am)] microgel.[200] This microgel was synthesized via photo-initiated free radical copolymerization of NIPAM with B18C6Am. This process took place inside the glass-capillary microchannels of a microﬂuidic chip to form uniform cylinder-shaped microgels. By putting a cylinder-shaped P(NIPAM-co-B18C6Am) mi- crogel inside capillary microchannels, a crescent-moon-shaped micro-space for ﬂowing ﬂuids was formed between the microgel and capillary. Upon recognizing Pb 2+, the microgel isothermally swells, thus decreasing the free space in the channel and the ﬂow rate drops correspondingly (Figure 35). The microgel’s reusabil- ity was tested at high temperatures because the microgel shrank, reducing the distance between B18C6Am/Pb2+ complexes. As a result, electronic repulsion increased, resulting in Pb 2+ de- complexation. Pb2+ could be detected down to 10−9 mconcen- trations by using an online ﬂowmeter and monitoring the ﬂow rate. In their next report about Pb2+ sensing, the same nanogel was synthesized and immobilized on a commercialized polycar- bonate membrane.[201] Upon addition of Pb2+, the volume of the nanogel increased, thus allowing [Pb 2+] monitoring through easy detectable transmembrane ﬂux changes. The pore size of the PNIPAM-nanogels reduced as the gels swelled, result- ing in decreased trans-membrane ﬂow and a LOD of 10 −10 m (Figure 36). In another study, a similar device was made by using a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acryloylamidobenzo-12- crown-4) (PNB) nanogel chamber and a bottom semipermeable membrane with a top indicator tube. [202] Pb2+-exposure induced hydrophobic to hydrophilic transitions, thus increasing the os- motic pressure, which increased the liquid level in the indicator tube (Figure 37). This device detected Pb2+ in water with a LOD of 10 − 10 m. Their group also exploited the crown ether-PNIPAM com- bination in several other conﬁgurations exploiting hollow mi- crogel P(NIPAM-B18C6Am),[203] hydrogel grating membrane P(NIPAM-co-B18C6Am), [83] nanogel P(NIPAM-B18C6Am),[204] Adv.

[205] Copper is one of the most important transition metals in the body. In absence of Hg2+, rhodamine can be utilized to sense Cu 2+, which also operates via a similar mecha- nism, viz. ring-opening of the spirolactam in presence of Cu2+ resulting in strong ﬂuorescence. This property was utilized by Wu and co-workers, who developed electrospun nanoﬁbers containing rhodamine for Cu2+ sensing.

P(NIPAM-co-NMA-co-RHPMA) (PNNR) where NMA is N- hydroxymethyl acrylamide and RHPMA is 4-rhodamine hydrazonomethyl-3-hydroxy-phenyl methacrylate (Figure 38). When heat is applied, the polymer collapses and the rhodamine moieties get compacted in the nanoﬁbers, which results in the suppression of the ﬂuorescence due to aggregation-induced quenching showing “oﬀ” state and hence proving regeneration of sensor. The sensor showed highly selective and sensitive recognition over Ca2+,Cd 2+,Co 2+,Fe 3+,Hg 2+,K+,Mg 2+,Mn2+, Pb2+,andZn2+ with a LOD down to 1 × 10 −6 m. Wang and co-workers designed a PNIPAM nanosphere for de- tecting Cu2+. [206] First, a negatively charged ligand anilino di- acetate (phenyl-IDA) was prepared and added to NIPAM and MBAM cross-linker to synthesize PNIPAM NPs using emulsion polymerization. Finally, the NPs were immobilized in a polyacry- lamide gel. The negatively charged ligand made the NPs swell and exhibited ﬂuorescence. Nevertheless, in the presence of para- magnetic Cu(II) the negative charge gets neutralized, causing the particle to shrink which resulted in ﬂuorescence quenching (Figure 39). Figure 38. Synthesis of PNNR.[98] Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (27 of 71) © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de Figure 39. Cu2+ responsive mechanism of NPs reported by Wang et al.[206] Qiao et al. developed a PNIPAM-based sensor for the detec- tion of Cu2+ in serum. [207] To facilitate the detection in serum, the authors grafted PNIPAM via living/controlled radical poly- merization method to AuNPs via a droplet microﬂuidic system. The PNIPAM improved the stability of the NPs by preventing ag- gregation. However, in presence of Cu2+, the lone pair electron of amide groups in the PNIPAM polymer chains bind to Cu2+ ions, thus causing aggregation of PNIPAM@AuNPs through Cu–N coordination bonds (Figure 40). This aggregation caused a bathochromic shift in the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the PNIPAM@AuNPs from blue to red. The detection range was cal- culated to be in the range 5.0–750.0 × 10−6 m with a LOD of 2.5 × 10 −6 m. Utilizing aggregation-induced emission (AIE), a Cu 2+ sen- sor was fabricated by Nhien et al.[208] Here the AIEgenic tetraphenylethylene-dipicolylamine (TPEDPA) monomer was in- corporated in the PNIPAM chain using free radical polymeriza- tion and two diﬀerent polymers were prepared with diﬀerent mo- lar ratios (P1:- x:y = 60:1and P2:- 175:1). The ﬂuorescence of the TPE unit was quenched by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) phenomena in presence of Cu2+ ions, thus halting the cyan emis- sion (Figure 41). At high-temperatures, aggregation of PNIPAM occurred, thus causing enhanced rotation and vibration of phenyl rings on TPE moieties. This, in turn, led to remove the restrictions to in- tramolecular rotation (RIR), thus reducing ﬂuorescence inten- sity. The two copolymers (P1 and P2) exhibited LODs 57 × 10−9 and 72 × 10 −9 m respectively. The reusability of the polymer was facilitated by treatment with a disodium ethylenediaminetetraac- etate (EDTA) solution. Han et al. investigated the use of rhodamine dyes for the de- tection of Al3+ and Fe 3+ in a DHBC system. The block-copolymer was synthesized from a polyethylene glycol (PEG) macroinitiator, whereby a second copolymer block of NIPAM with rhodamine Figure 40. Binding of PNIPAM with Cu2+.

[209] In addi- tion, they also prepared a double hydrophilic polymer with an- other metal recognizing scaﬀold, viz. 2,4-methacryloyl benzalde- hyde oxime (BDMa), in a similar fashion, to obtain (PEG113- b-P(NIPAM-co-BDMa)60). Here, BDMa was chelated with Al3+ through the interactions with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl, imine nitrogen, and the phenolic hydroxyl group to form a rigid complex that exhibited blue ﬂuorescence. On the other hand, the rhodamine motif featuring the amide group of the ethylenedi- amine moiety and the cyclic amide of the spirolactam ring could coordinate Fe 3+, which resulted in visible yellow ﬂuorescence (Figure 42). At elevated temperatures, the hydrophobic associa- tion of the PNIPAM block facilitated micellization and the aggre- gation of the metal ion sensing moieties in the hydrophobic core of the micelle, which increased ﬂuorescence and consequently LODs. In this fashion, the developed system could reach LODs of ≈5.95 × 10−9 to ≈4.02 × 10 −9 mfor Al 3+ and ≈30.30 × 10−9 to ≈23.84 × 10−9 mfor Fe 3+. Detection of the hexavalent Cr(VI) ion is of particular im- portance in air and water, due to its genotoxicity and carcino- genicity. For drinking water, in particular, governmental agen- cies allow only low levels of hexavalent Cr(VI) ions, e.g., Cal- ifornia allows only 10 ppb.[210] While challenging, Shen et al. developed a PNIPAM-based sensor capable of detecting hexava- lent Cr(VI) ions down to a limit of 1 ppb in water. Towards this end, they designed a novel thermo-responsive photoluminescent silver cluster/P(NIPAM-co-AAc) microgel nanocomposite, which relies on the excellent photoluminescent properties of Ag nan- oclusters for accurate detection.[211] The submicron hydrogel par- ticles were synthesized via one-step precipitation copolymeriza- tion followed by the formation of Ag clusters/P(NIPAM-co-AAc) hydrogel composites by irradiation reduction. The PL intensity of the nanocomposites was eﬀectively quenched by Cr(VI) due to the electron transfer from the electron-rich Ag nanoclusters to electron-deﬁcient Cr(VI). Again, free coordination of the met- als to polymer bound ─COOH and ─NHCO groups reduced the distance between Cr(VI) and Ag nanoclusters, thus resulting in quenching of PL of the nanocomposite. Upon heating, the con- formation of hydrogel changed resulting in aggregation and re- ducing the distance between Ag nanoclusters, and consequently the PL intensity (Figure 43). Another hazardous metal-oxide ion is MnO4−, which is of par- ticular concern due to its carcinogenic properties and extensive use in both laboratory and industrial ﬁelds. The World Health Or- ganization (WHO) has ﬁxed the guideline value for manganese in drinking water from 500 to 400 μgL−1. [212] Zhu et al., how- ever, developed a very sensitive MnO4− sensor, capable of detect- ing MnO4− anions up to 25 × 10 −9 m with a linear concentration range of 0–50 × 10 −6 m, well below the limits set for drinking Adv.

[213] Their system consisted of a ﬂuorescent microgel PNI- MSPC, which was prepared by surfactant-free emulsion poly- merization (SFEP) of NIPAM and a dichlorinated crosslinker, viz. 1,1′-di[4-(vinyl) benzyl]−4,4′-pyridinium salt (MSPC2+.2Cl −), which served as ﬂuorophore and ion sensing receptor (Figure 44). In the presence of MnO4− in aqueous solvent, signiﬁcant ﬂuores- cence quenching for PNI-MSPC microgel was observed. At high temperatures, the microgel shrunk, as observed from decrease in the hydrodynamic diameter, which went paired with a blue shift of the ﬂuorescent spectrum. As a result, the detection sensitivity was greater at low temperatures (below LCST). A ﬁnal metal ion of interest is the calcium (II) ion (Ca 2+), al- though not toxic, this metal ion plays a signiﬁcant role in bio- logical processes. The variation of Ca 2+ concentration plays a vi- tal role in signal transduction, which is related to Alzheimer’s disease. This fact made detection of Ca 2+ so important. The ﬂu- orescence method also was used to detect Ca2+.Asreported previously[162] the modiﬁed homopolymer of PNIPAM detected Ca 2+. Due to Ca 2+ entry through transduction channels, ﬂuores- cence intensity was increased. Again, using SPR process small multivalent cations (e.g., Ca 2+, Fe 2+,and Fe 3+) were distinguishably measurable over mono- valent cations (e.g., Na + and K+) with nanogel P(NIPAM-co- AAc) nanogels.[214] The nanogel was prepared with radical poly- merization and the Ca2+,Fe 2+,and Fe 3+ ions formed MPB-like structures by interacting with carboxylates in the nanogel net- works (Figure 45), while Na + and K+ cannot form such MPB-like structures due to the charge valence of the metal ions. A high SPR value was observed for bi or tri-valence cations than mono- valence cations. PNIPAM based chemosensors towards metal ions are gener- ally very sensitive and speciﬁc. Nevertheless, most covered exam- ples are single-use sensors due to the irreversible nature of the sensing mechanism. While some examples cover regeneration steps to enable reuse, others employ the thermoresponsive be- havior of PNIPAM to enable reuse, facilitating repeated and ac- curate readout by simply applying mild heat. Besides reuse, these chemosensors display often suﬃciently high selectivity towards single analyte in the presence of background analytes, which en- sures a broad applicability. In addition, the sensor oﬀers a quick readout and a LOD in the nM range, which makes it appropri- ate for disease diagnosis, and environmental protection. Analyte- sensitive sensors should typically provide for accurate and de- pendable readout and have a wide tolerance to various media. A possible application of the sensor is when it detects Cu(II) ions in serum, a complicated medium. 2.3.2. Salt Sensing As PNIPAM contains both hydrophilic (amide) and hydrophobic (isopropyl) groups, it has been used as a model system to under- stand the complex ionic interactions between salts[215] and pro- teins in aqueous solutions. These interactions have been exten- sively studied and are known as the Hofmeister series, ﬁrst de- termined by Franz Hofmeister who studied the salt eﬀect on hen egg protein solubility in water,[216] where he qualitatively ranked ions by their ability to precipitate/solubilize proteins or macro- molecules in aqueous solution.[217] Ions on the left side of chloride and sodium in Figure 46 are known as kosmotropes (‘‘order-makers″) and those on the right side are known as chaotropes (‘‘disorder-makers″). The ions on the left side of the series with high charge density form hydrate complexes by breaking hydrogen bonding to the amide oxygen and nitrogen of PNIPAM, which decreases the number of water molecules that are available to form hydrogen bonds with the polymer, thus decreasing its hydration.

As a re- sult, the free energy increases to form cavities to accommo- date the hydrophobic isopropyl groups and the polymer back- bone. This eﬀect is known as the salting-out eﬀect, which de- creases polymer solubility via the formation of aggregates fol- lowed by phase separation. The ions on the right side of the se- ries form weakly hydrated ions of low charge density which in- crease the solubility of the polymer and is known as salting in eﬀect. For salt sensing, AuNPs decorated with PNIPAM have been demonstrated to be excellent tools, due to their colorimetric out- put. Yusa et al. were the ﬁrst who reported the eﬀect of salt on PNIPAM-coated AuNPs.[218] In this conﬁguration, the concen- tration and identity of the salt have a signiﬁcant impact on the Figure 46. Hofmeister series of anions and cations and their salting in and salting out inﬂuence on protein or macromolecules in aqueous medium.[217] Adv. Funct.

Synthesis of microgel which got shrink in presence of NaCl.[222] LCST behavior of PNIPAM and consequently on the colorimetric output of the AuNPs. This observation has been well-described by Maji et al. [145] (the structure was deﬁned at the temperature sensing portion). They showed that diﬀerent salt concentrations facilitated a shift in absorbance at elevated temperatures due to AuNP aggregation, which in turn induced electronic coupling of the SPR. In their study, they also demonstrated that the tem- perature sensitivity increased in the presence of NaSCN, com- pared to NaCl, due to charge screening and Hofmeister eﬀects. In a separate publication, the authors demonstrated that the sen- sitivity of the system can be enhanced by increasing polymer chain length.[219] In addition to AuNPs, other PNIPAM-decorated colloidal particles have been used for salt sensing. Humphreys et al. prepared colloidal silica particles with PNIPAM brushes via a “grafting to” method from surface-initiated activators re- generated by electron transfer-atom transfer radical polymeriza- tion (SI-ARGET ATRP).[220] These hybrid particles are electrostat- ically stabilized in pure water at high temperatures. Whereas, the brush layer is collapsed due to the electrostatic repulsive overlap between the diﬀuse double layers. This repulsive overlap occurs at a longer range than the attractive hydrophobic polymer brush layer interactions. With the addition of salt, the Debye length was reduced and consequently, the inﬂuential range of the particle surface potential decreased. This lower surface potential value is unable to extend beyond the thickness of the collapsed poly- mer brush (above the LCST) and the attractive polymer-polymer interactions between particles eﬀect in particle aggregation. The authors conﬁrmed the eﬀect of the Hofmeister series in the pres- ence of 1 × 10 −3,10 × 10 −3, and 500 × 10 −3 m solutions of KCl, KNO3,orKSCN. Carvalho et al. fabricated an etalon device where they check the validity of the Hofmeister series.[221] Thedeviceconsisted of a P(NIPAM-AAc) prepared by free radical precipitation polymer- ization, which was placed between two Au layers. The microgel P(NIPAM-AAc) changed in thickness in response to salt, which induced the variation of distance between two Au layers. The vari- ation of interlayer distance resulted in a reﬂectivity change. Here taking NaCl, CH3COONa, KCl, MgCl2,CaCl2,MgSO4,NaSO4, (NH4)2SO4 salts they verify the series. A blue shift of the reﬂec- tion spectra was obtained in the presence of all salts due to cation screening of the negatively charged carboxylic groups, causing the anionic microgels to shrink. Mugo and Dhanjai exploited the inﬂuence of salt on the phase transition of PNIPAM to measure NaCl in sweat.[222] Usually, chloride levels in sweat are typically ≈17–55 × 10−3 m, with ≥60 × 10 −3 m being a possible indicator for cystic ﬁbrosis.[223] The sen- sor consisted of porous ﬁlms from nanoporous carbon nanotube- cellulose nanocrystals (CNC/CNT) which were entrained with PNIPAM based microgels. [222] The sensor was prepared by ﬁrst preparing P(NIPAM-co-AAc-co-NSA). Next, a suspension of the microgel was deposited onto a prepared CNC/CNT nanoporous ﬁlm. Subsequently, aniline (ANI) and phenylboronic acid (PBA) were added, followed by the addition of a lactate solution to in- duce polymerization, yielding the lactate imprinted PANI/PBA- PNIPAM @CNC/CNT sensor (Figure 47). With the increase of salt concentration, the microgel shrunk due to PNIPAM-induced water dislodgement from the microgel network, which resulted in increased sensor capacitance. The sensor exhibited a linear de- tection range of (1–25) × 10 −3 m and a LOD of 0.10 × 10 −3 mof NaCl in sweat. It also detected the biomarker lactate in sweat. The Hofmeister series commonly serves as the basis for salt recognition using responsive polymers. Scientists used the in- ﬂuence of salt content on the phase transition of PNIPAM to de- velop a salt sensor. Still, one drawback of the Hofmeister series salt sensor is its limited selectivity towards a speciﬁc salt. It has been noted that it tends to follow the Hofmeister series rather than being selective, which complicates the analysis of complex mixtures or enable salt detection in complex media. Similar to the metal-ion sensing, moieties that have selective interactions with the analytes of interest could possibly address this shortcoming. 2.4. Organic Molecule Sensing Besides metal ions and salt sensing, the detection of speciﬁc classes of organic molecules or functional groups plays a huge role in modern society ranging from the detection of hazardous substances, such as toxins,[224] explosives, [225] and contaminants in food,[226] pharmaceuticals,[227] and various other consumer and industrial products, to the detection of molecules present in the body such as metabolites, performance-enhancing drugs, alcohol and various illegal substances. Analytical methods such as GC-MS and LC-MS are available for the detection of organic compounds, just like they are for metal ions. Nevertheless, this associated equipment requires suitable infrastructure for its op- eration. In addition, samples from complex media, e.g., blood can require substantial sample preparation prior to the analysis, fur- ther complicating its implementation and application for non- experts. Therefore, the development of lightweight, portable sen- sors with straightforward interpretation is of particular interest for these applications. Moreover, for this purpose, various PNI- PAM based systems have been developed, which will be outlined below according to the analyte of interest. Alcohols are quite important in various ﬁelds, including chem- ical, biological, pharmaceutical, medical, material, and food in- dustries. They take part in a variety of metabolic processes directly or indirectly. They are metabolized predominantly by the liver.[228] Their concentration detects the quality of the Adv. Funct.

Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de Figure 48. a) Structure of hydrogel grating, b) Change of the refractive index and height with ethanol concentration, c) Design of the ethanol detecting system.[231] Copyright 2019, American Chemical Society. materials, e.g., during the biological fermentation process for ethanol production, the eﬃciency and yield are controlled by the tolerance capability of the yeast to the ethanol concentration. [229] Generally, PNIPAM-based phase separation occurs in an aque- ous solvent, but in aqueous ethanol solutions, ethanol com- petes with water to form stable PNIPAM clathrate hydrate struc- tures and, generally, PNIPAM shrinks when the ethanol con- centration exceeds the critical responsive concentration (Cc)due to the broken hydrogen bonds, also known as co-nonsolvency. Zou et al. fabricated an ethanol detecting device based on the combination of microﬂuidics and membranes. [230] First, a PNI- PAM nanogel was synthesized by precipitation polymerization and the ethanol responsive membrane was prepared from it via a vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process. PDMS mod- ules were prepared by soft-lithography techniques using SU-8 2035 and a microﬂuidic membrane device was made with an ethanol responsive membrane via a “stamp-like” method by us- ing a PDMS prepolymer as the adhesive. Below the LCST, the PNIPAM chain is swollen in water due to the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules and amide groups. Whereas, in the presence of ethanol, both water and ethanol compete to solvate PNIPAM, which results in the formation of stable water clathrate hydrate structures. Consequently, the PNIPAM chains collapse when the concentration of ethanol exceeds the Cc.When the ethanol concentration (CE) is lower than Cc, the permeation ﬂux across the ethanol-responsive membrane decreases due to the high resistance for permeation of the swollen nanogel, while at high ethanol concentration the collapse of the chains and de- hydration of the nanogel allows for a higher permeation ﬂux. The authors could quantify the ethanol concentration between 3 vol% to 13 vol% by measuring the permeation ﬂux in the device. The same group also explored a system with a grated hydrogel membrane for the detection of ethanol. [231] The hydrogel grat- ing was produced by sandwiching a solution of NIPAM, AAm, and a MBAM cross-linker between a glass substrate and PDMS stamp and subsequent exposure to UV irradiation. In the next step, the PDMS ﬁlm was removed, thus obtaining the grated hy- drogel (Figure 48). In their earlier work mentioned above, the ethanol causes the polymer chains to collapse; however, this time, the authors measure the change in diﬀraction eﬃciency (DE) to identify the changes in the height and refractive index of the hy- drogel gratings. This system, therefore, enables facile ethanol de- tection via a straightforward optical approach, which enabled the detection of ethanol concentrations of 0−30 vol%. Planar MIM optical cavities also have the ability to sense alco- hols, as described in the temperature-sensing section.[156] In the described example, the thickness of the PNIPAM microgel drops in the presence of alcohol up to a 20% concentration, causing a decrease in transition wavelength. Hydroquinone (HQ), a phenolic compound, is used in the preparation of rubber antioxidants, stabilizers, and antioxidants. However, it is extremely harmful to both the environment and mankind. HQ can be sensed using unique optical, elec- tronic, and catalytic properties of carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Zhou and co-workers designed an electrode that consisted of a composite ﬁlm for electrochemical “on/oﬀ” detection of dihydroxybenzenes, such as HQ. [232] A [poly(N- isopropylacrylamide)101-b-poly(2-acrylamidoethyl benzoate)37] PNIPAM101-b-PAAEB37 copolymer was prepared and GO solu- tion was added to yield a suspension solution of PNIPAM101- b-PAAEB37/GO. Similarly, a PNIPAM101-b-PAAEB37/SMWCNs solution was synthesized by adding short multi-walled car- bon nanotubes (SMWCNs) to PNIPAM101-b-PAAEB37.Next, Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (34 of 71) © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de Figure 49. The sensing mechanism of the polymer where the electronic transition occurred when temperature less than LCST. Reproduced with permission.[232] Copyright 2016, Elsevier Ltd. aPNIPAM101-b-PAAEB37/GO/SMWCNs (PGS) solution was formed by mixing the PG and PS solutions and the resulting solution was placed on glass carbon electrode (GCE) by drop- ping. At a temperature lower than the LCST, the PNIPAM chain is in the swollen state, which increases the distance between GO sheets and interfacial electron transfer resistance is high. Whereas, above the LCST, the polymer chain collapses and the distance between GO sheets decreases, resulting in well-deﬁned redox peaks (Figure 49). This approach enabled electrochemical “on/oﬀ” detection of dihydroxybenzenes as low as 2.7 × 10−5 mol L−1. Another “On-Oﬀ” electrochemical detection system for HQ was developed by Zhao et al. based one triblock copolymer PS- PNIPAM-PS prepared via RAFT polymerization.[233] The copoly- mer solution was dispersed uniformly on the GCE. The copoly- mer forms a core–shell structure with PS in core and PNIPAM in shell. At low temperature, HQ can exchange electrons with electrode surface via the gap between polymer micelles. However, above LCST, PNIPAM-loop collapses and micelles agglomerate, which prevents HQ from undergoing redox reactions on the elec- trode surface causing no response (Figure 50). HQ has been de- tected with a good detection range for hydroquinone (6 × 10−7 to 2.35 × 10 −3 m) and a low LOD (490 × 10 −9 m) and observed via diﬀerential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Nitroaromatic explosives draw wide attraction due to their powerful explosivity and serious environmental hazards. So rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of it is gaining increas- ing concern. Ahmad et al. reported an electrochemical sensor for detecting 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). [234] Here they prepared a single-chain stimuli-responsive templated polymer with a tar- get analyte. A random template copolymer consisting of NI- PAM, methacrylic acid (MAA), and 4-vinylpyridine (VP) and 4-NP was prepared via the RAFT process using DDMAT (2- dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio-2-methylpropionic acid) as RAFT agent for functionalization onto the electrode surface. In par- allel, a homopolymer of PNIPAM was also prepared by the RAFT process. After template (4-NP) removal, the copoly- mer was grafted on an Au electrode with the help of tris(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) which reduces the trithiocar- bonyl group to sulfur (Figure 51). The resulting polymer was in- corporated with 4-NP and grafted on the electrode and underwent distinct conformational changes upon target binding as above LCST the volume of hydrogel increased with the increase of tem- plate concentration. This conformational change induces a dis- tinguishable change in the electrochemical signals via altering the interface charge transfer kinetics. This signal corresponds to the presence of 4-NP. Babu et al. designed a ﬂuorescence-based nitroaromatics de- tection via 𝜋-electron-rich anthrapyrazolone-derived ﬂuorophore moiety with PNIPAM.[235] By using free radical polymerization NIPAM unit was incorporated with the dye with enhanced sol- ubility. In the presence of nitrophenol compounds (dinitrophe- nol, trinitrophenol and para-nitrophenol), quenching of the emis- sion intensity was observed due to PET occurring from the pyra- zoloanthrone units on the crosslinked polymer to the electron- deﬁcient nitrophenol molecules. At elevated temperatures above the LCST phase transition, PNIPAM gets dehydrated and subse- quently, the ﬂuorophore unit also becomes aggregated. Hence PL intensity get quenches. The LOD was exhibited as 0.12 × 10−9 m (Figure 52). Dopamine (DA) is an organic chemical in the catecholamine family that plays a critical role in the function of the central ner- vous system (CNS), endocrine system, and cardiovascular sys- tem. Its concentration indicates various types of diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and dementia.[236–238] Thus, its detection is particularly useful in biomedicine. Two diﬀerent sensor platforms, namely SPR and microcantilevers (MCL) were used to detect DA as demonstrated by Jiang et al.[239] Their system made use of a statistical copolymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-st-5- methacrylamido-1,2-benzoxaborole) (P(NIPAM-st-MAAmBO)), which was prepared via RAFT polymerization. The polymer was subsequently immobilized on an Au substrate for SPR detection via the dithioester group at the polymer terminal intro- duced from the RAFT agent. In the next step, the immobilized copolymer was coupled to a maltosylated polyacrylamide, poly(2- lactobionamidoethyl methacrylamide) (PLAEMA) through dynamic covalent boronate ester bonds. When this system was exposed to DA, the PLAEMA is released, as the formation of boronate esters with the cis diol group of DA is preferred (Figure 53). This displacement of PLAEMA induced a change in the local refractive index and the reﬂection angle change on the SPR sensor surface. Moreover, in the presence of DA, swelling of the polymer occurs which increases the local refractive index. The authors demonstrated that the same approach could also be applied to an Au microcantilever system, whereby DA-induced release of PLAEMA resulted in surface stress variation of the cantilever. The SPR biosensor can detect DA in the concentration range of 1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10 −4 mol L −1 while the MCL sensor exhibited a LOD of 5 × 10 −11 mol L −1. Wang et al. prepared a microgel-based dopamine sensor us- ing an optical device named etalon.[240] Etalons, photonic ma- terials were synthesized by depositing a single layer of micro- gels on an Au-coated glass substrate, and then another layer of Au was deposited on the microgels to form a sandwiching struc- ture and the reﬂection wavelength was dependent on the Au-Au Adv.

The etalon was prepared by sandwiching the microgel between two Au layers, followed by the ﬁxation of tyrosinase on etalon surfaces. In the presence of dopamine, tyrosinase oxidizes the dopamine to form a ﬁlm (Figure 54). Then ZnCl2 was added to the etalon, whereby the formed dopamine ﬁlms inhibited the ZnCl2 diﬀusion into the etalon which previously changed the volume of microgel, re- sulting in a DA concentration-dependent response concerning the optical properties of the device. The sensor showed a LOD for dopamine of 11.5 ppm in DI water, 18.7 ppm in urine, and 21.4 ppm in serum. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) readily go into the va- por phase due to their low vapor pressure. Biogenic VOCs are very important in the survival of plants and animals, as they can serve in inter/-intra-species communication (i.e., attract pollina- tors, seed dispersers, ﬁnding suitable mates, marking territory) as well as a defense mechanism. Some VOCs are soluble in the aqueous medium, and therefore easily detected. The Serpe group designed a novel optical device named etalon in which a PNI- PAM microgel-based monolayer was inserted between two Au layers.[241] Here, 1.27 × 10 −3 m THF could be detected within 4 min. The microgel was made with NIPAM monomer and MBAM crosslinker, and an etalon device was created with it. The etalon device was placed in water and hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, chloroform, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) vapors were inserted through bubbling. Upon exposure to the aqueous VOCs, the size of the microgels changed, which depended on PNIPAM’s solubility in the speciﬁc aqueous VOC solution. The variation in microgel size changed the distance between the two Au layers, and consequently the wavelength (𝜆) of other reﬂected light. Compared to others THF has better solubility in water and both are good solvents for PNIPAM. Hence PNIPAM became swollen and the distance between two Au changed. In this fashion, speciﬁc absorbances were generated for dif- ferent VOCs, which facilitated their straightforward identiﬁca- tion. Within 4 minutes, 1.27 × 10 −3 m THF may be detected (Figure 55). Organic dyes are extensively used in textile, leather, cosmet- ics, garments, printing, and paper industries. However, the dyes are harmful to the human body and cause serious water pollu- tion. Therefore, the detection of these dyes draws growing at- tention. Plasmonic-active metal nanostructures can be used as optically triggerable catalytic systems, extremely sensitive sensor platforms, and photonic modulators with unprecedented speed. Their surface modiﬁcation allows for the design and develop- ment of a new generation of sensor devices, related to the area of so-called smart plasmonic systems. Guselnikova et al. reported a PNIPAM grafted Au grating for surface-enhanced Raman scat- tering (SERS) detection of azo-dyes.[242] SERS is a method to determine the composition, structure, conformation, and inter- action of molecules, exhibiting great potential in various ﬁelds including analytical chemistry, food science, and biology due to its prominent sensitivity, anti-interference performance, fast and Adv.

Fabrication of etalon device.[240] facile detection through plasmon-enhanced excitation, and scat- tering. 4-Carboxybenzenediazonium tosylate (ADT-COOH) was used to modify the gold grating. Then the grafting-to approach was performed with PNIPAM-NH2 via NHS-carbodiimide coupling to prepare a 7 nM thick layer (Figure 56). Various azo-dyes, such as crystal violet (CV), disperse red 1 (DR1), and metanil yellow (ME) could be detected. The sensor utilized PNIPAM’s thermal response to trap and enrich the dye concentration near the sur- face of the detector, thus increasing the Raman response by sev- eral orders of magnitude. In this fashion, the prepared plasmonic sensor could detect azo dyes down to femtomolar concentrations. Finally, the authors demonstrated the sensor could be regener- Figure 55. Color exhibited by etalon device in presence of diﬀerent VOCs. Reproduced with permission.[241] Copyright 2019, Elsevier Ltd. ated by exploiting the reversibility of the thermal response of PNI- PAM. It has been noted that PNIPAM introduces a fascinating fea- ture to the detection of organic molecules. Using a PNIPAM- based design, a range of organic compounds can be sensed, in- cluding alcohol (0–30 vol%) by virtue of its inﬂuence on the PNI- PAM phase transfer process. While, nitroaromatic compounds can be detected selectively, as demonstrated by the analysis of a sample of river water. DA can be detected from complex systems like serum and urine. Within a 4-minute response time, VOCs can be detected using PNIPAM microgel-based system. These examples demonstrate the broad applicability in terms of deal- ing with complex media, allowing the detection of various analyte classes and the medium response times necessary for the detec- tion process. 2.5. Pressure Sensors Pressure is characterized as force per unit area. Measurement of pressure has a wide range of applications such as in aircraft, satel- lites, weather, and barometric applications. In medicine, pressure measurements give an idea about pulse rate, blood pressure, and various other physiological measures. Therefore, pressure sens- ing is gaining increasing interest. PNIPAM hydrogels draw in- creasing attention to form pressure sensors due to their excel- lent mechanical properties. Nanocomposite hydrogels are exten- sively used due to their remarkable physical properties, such as a high degree of mechanical toughness, elastic response over large deformations, high swelling ratios, rapid swelling-deswelling responses, and optical transparency. Cellini et al. synthesized a laponite crosslinked P(NIPAM-co-Py-PEGMA) nanocomposite hydrogel, whereby PEGMA units were ﬂuorescently labeled with Adv. Funct.

[243] When the nanocomposite hydrogel is ex- posed to pressure, the pyrene groups undergo progressive reor- ganization during the stretching of the network which leads to a detectable change in ﬂuorescence emission (Figure 57). The model can detect pressures on the order of 102 Pa. A hydrodynamic pressure sensor inspired by the canal lat- eral line system of ﬁsh, was designed by Jiang et al. [244] The sensor consisted of a microﬂuidic PDMS canal and four microcantilevers based on biomimetic neuromasts (BN) containing poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride-triﬂuoro ethylene) (P(VDF- TrFE))/polyimide (PI) cantilever, a microheater, and a PNIPAM hydrogel cupula (dome-shaped cap) (Figure 58). The hydrogel was formed in the presence of MBAM crosslinker. When the heating is turned oﬀ (below LCST) PNIPAM forms a clathrate Figure 57. Mechanical response of hydrogel. Reproduced with permission.[243] Copyright 2016, Elsevier Ltd. which was hydrophobically hydrated in water. Above LCST (heater on) the structure of the clathrate was deformed due to the temperature and volume of the hydrogel cupula decreased. Upon application of pressure, the height of the hydrogel cupula was re- duced which induced a cantilever deﬂection, which corresponded to the applied pressure. Using an electrochemical method, the model exhibited a sensitivity of approximately 0.31 Mv/Pa/m at heater on state. Another pressure sensor was fabricated using DN hydrogels. It showed fracture toughness, fracture tensile stress, and frac- ture tensile strain which improved the mechanical properties of hydrogels. As described earlier,[151] the volume of the fabricated DN hydrogel decreased upon exposure to pressure, which caused a decrease in resistance due to the improvement of electronic transmission between continuous layer structures of GO and the tight DN structure of hydrogels (Figure 59). The hydrogel could bear pressure up to 0.754 MPa. PNIPAM hydrogels are utilized as pressure sensors because of their exceptional mechanical prop- erties. Wang et al. synthesized a dually synergetic network hydro- gel that has properties like integrated mechanical stretchabil- ity, thermal responsiveness, and electrical conductivity. Its struc- ture is described in the “Temperature Sensor” section.[152] In the presence of pressure shape of the hydrogel changed which in- duced electric signals, like current or resistance when the hy- drogel was connected to a circuit. The brightness of the LED was diminished with tensile deformation and increased with the releasing process. This hydrogel was used to prepare a wear- able sensor to detect the bending motion of ﬁngers and wrist, swallowing motion and pulse rate. A wearable sensor for detect- ing strain was designed by Feng et al.[150] They designed triple- network hydrogel with excellent conductivity (≈170 Ω mm−1), mechanical tolerance (1.1 MPa), and rapid recoverability (within Adv.

Here also deformation occurs in the application of pres- sure which gives an electrical signal that corresponds to the ap- plied pressure. The incorporation of PNIPAM in the hydrogel introduced recoverability. Another hydrogel PNIPAM/CMCS/- MWCNT/PANI was utilized as a pressure sensor.[153] With the increase of strain, the relative resistance of hydrogel increased. In the pressure sensor ﬁeld, PNIPAM has received compara- tively little attention. In some cases, electric conduction was in- corporated to enable pressure sensing. Investigations are under- way in this ﬁeld, and we may see some pressure sensors in the fu- ture. The PNIPAM/PANI hydrogel-based strain sensor has been shown to have a response time of as low as 0.4 s, in addition to the hydrogel’s exceptional mechanical properties. This sensor Figure 59.

Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de has been used in the development of wearable sensors to track movements of the human body and, with careful engineering, to monitor disease. 2.6. Gas Sensors Hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas is emitted from burning fuels con- taining chlorine and incinerating plastic-containing waste. How- ever, HCl gas may cause toxic eﬀects on the human body and has been identiﬁed as a cause of acid rain. As a result, reliable detec- tion of HCl gas has been required from the standpoint of emis- sion control and air-quality monitoring. Matsuguchi and Tada designed quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)-based HCl gas sen- sors because of their simplicity and high sensitivity. [245] PNIPAM was synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), and NPs were generated by spray coating its aqueous solution onto a heated quartz resonator surface at 50 °C (above PNIPAM’s LCST). Due to HCl adsorption, the frequency shift of the res- onator was observed. Additionally, the sensor showed a 90% re- covery. Their group also developed an HCl gas sensor utilizing the same process, with the exception that they used a water-methanol binary solvent and used the cononsolvency eﬀect on the phase transition of PNIPAM aqueous solutions.[246] Cononsolvency is a phenomenon where the LCST of PNIPAM is aﬀected by the addition of good organic solvents. Although, the fabricated sys- tem exhibited reusability of less than 90% at the ﬁrst cycle, which is improved to almost 100% at the third cycle. 3. PNIPAM-Based Biochemical Sensors 3.1. Biomolecules Sensing Molecules with a biological function or found in living organ- isms, i.e., biomolecules, come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and structures, each with its speciﬁc function. There are four major types of biomolecules, namely carbohydrates, lipids, nu- cleic acids, and peptides/proteins. The ability to characterize de- tect and quantify biomolecules plays a signiﬁcant role in our understanding of life, its function in physiological processes in health and diseased states. Here, PNIPAM-based systems have demonstrated the ability to aid in the detection of a variety of biomolecules, which will be outlined below. 3.1.1. Glucose Sensing Glucose is one of the most important energy sources in the human body and a crucial agent in the food industry. [247] In medicine, monitoring of blood glucose levels is routinely mea- sured for people suﬀering from diabetes, during pregnancy and to diagnose liver diseases.[248,249] The normal range of glucose concentration is between 3.9 × 10−9 mto7.8 × 10 −3 m in blood, and 0 × 10 −3 to 0.8 × 10 −3 m in urine. In diabetes patients, glu- cose concentrations vary from about 10 × 10−3 to 21.1 × 10 −3 min blood and 1.0 × 10 −3 to 2.8 × 10 −3 m in urine. This hyperglycemia, if left unchecked, is the cause of many secondary symptoms and Figure 60. Synthesis of microgel with glucose induce phase transition.

Besides diabetes, glucose also plays an important role in cancer, as cancer cells consume glucose more rapidly than normal cells, and their growth is therefore highly dependent on glucose metabolism.[250] Hence, glucose is an im- portant indicator of health, diet, and age. Huang et al. synthesized a glucose sensor by calculating O2 production by glucose oxidation.[251] For this purpose, they ﬁrst introduced the PNIPAM-immobilized glucose oxidase (GOD) complex (PIGC) for ﬁber optic glucose sensing. PIGC was syn- thesized by polymerizing NIPAM, MBAM and GOD immobi- lized SiO2 NPs. At a temperature lower than the LCST, the hydro- gel is in the swollen state allowing the enzyme to contact the sub- strate, resulting in an enzymatic catalysis reaction forming O2. This O2 quenches the ﬂuorescence. The prepared sensor shows glucose-sensing in the range of 50–700 mg dL −1 in the real sam- ple. The prepared sensor might sense cholesterol in addition to glucose, according to their forthcoming study on glucose sensors.[252] Here GOx and cholesterol oxidase (COD) were im- mobilized on the SiO2 NPs to prepare a multiparameter ﬁber- optic biosensor based on the same PIGC and immobilized COD. Above the LCST the incorporated GOx was isolated from the sub- strate, so no oxidation of glucose occurred but COD can oxidize cholesterol, while below the LCST the swollen hydrogel enabled GOx contact with glucose and oxidation occurred. In both reac- tions, O2 is emitted which quenches the ﬂuorescence. The hydro- gel detects cholesterol concentration in the range of 20–250 mg dL −1 and glucose concentration in the range of 50–700 mg dL −1. In vivo, glucose sensors can be prepared from an apo-enzyme, such as apo-GOx which is an inactive (non-metabolizing) form of an enzyme with the cofactor/coenzyme being removed. In this fashion, the high speciﬁcity of enzymes towards their sub- strates and associated conformational changes of the enzyme can be exploited without the transformation of the substrate, which is ideal for sensing applications. A recent example of such an apo-Gox sensor can be found in the work of Ye et al., who introduced apo-GOx in a microgel for glucose recognition and monitoring in physiological concentrations. [253] The Apo-enzyme apo-glucose oxidase (apo-GOx) was prepared by removing the coenzyme ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and subsequently, apo-GOx@PNIPAM microgels were synthesized via free rad- ical precipitation copolymerization using NIPAM and MBAM crosslinker in the presence of apo-Gox (Figure 60). The micro- gels displayed characteristic swelling in the presence of glucose, due to the charge-dipole and hydrogen-bond interactions formed between the apo-enzyme and its substrate, which was conﬁrmed via DLS measurement. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated the high selectivity for 𝛽-D-glucose, as the observed swelling was Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (41 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

The fabricated microgel can selectively detect 𝛽-D-glucose with a sensitivity range of 0–20 × 10 −3 m. This study demonstrates a useful use in diabetic mice. DNAzymes are oligonucleotides with the ability to catalyze chemical reactions, therefore exhibiting similarities to enzymes. Hence, they can be applied as a useful tool in sensing ap- plications. The utility of DNAzymes in glucose sensing has been explored in combination with PNIPAM microgels by Li et al. [254] In their system, the authors combined the hemin-G- quadruplex horseradish peroxidase (HRP) mimicking DNAzyme on PNIPAM microgel surface by a one-step precipitation poly- merization (Figure 61). The porous structure of the PNI- PAM microgel was encapsulated with an enzyme and GOx. The GOx catalyzed the reaction to form H2O2 from the re- action with O2 and glucose. The H2O2 further oxidized 2,2′- Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS2−) salt to generate colored ABTS•− in the presence of HRP mimicking DNAzyme, to produce readout signals. At a temperature higher than LCST of PNIPAM, PNIPAM/DNAzyme transforms to a shrunken state and gets separated from water solvent. Subsequently, after centrifugation, this polymer can be reused. Another type of glucose sensor was prepared by Chen et al. using sonochemistry. [255] Due to its unique qualities, such as cheap cost, customizable nanostructure, high sensitivity, quick reaction, and long-term stability, they developed a CuO-based nanocomposite. Using N2 aeration the ultrasonic synthesis of CuO@PNIPAM hybrid nanomaterial was performed, followed by modiﬁcation with GCE. Initially, due to the Cu(II)/Cu(III) re- dox couple, a peak at about +0.65 V was observed. However, in the presence of glucose, Cu(III) was reduced to Cu(II), which showed a peak at 0.55 V on the CV curve, and glucose converted to glu- conic acid as a result of the presence of powerful oxidant Cu(III). At lower temperatures, the hydrophilic PNIPAM allowed glucose to diﬀuse to electroactive CuO. When the temperature was higher than the LCST, PNIPAM turned into a hydrophobic state that pre- vented glucose contact with CuO and displayed an “oﬀ” state. Phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives are prominently used probes for glucose sensing. In alkaline media, PBAs form a tetrahedral boronic acid anion. This anion is reactive towards diols, such as the 1,2- or 1,3 diols found on glucose, thus yielding the corresponding boronic esters. [256] Therefore, with the introduction of PBA moieties into the PNIPAM chain, various types of glucose sensors are prepared. Several PNI- PAM sensors have been developed for glucose sensing, uti- lizing VPTT and size-changing of the polymer, [74–78] polymer- ized crystalline colloidal array (PCCA) glucose sensor was reported.[104] Other examples of optical glucose sensors are in- verse opal[105] and photonic crystal. [257] A FRET process was also introduced in polymer chain by incorporating a FRET pair.[104] Tang et al. prepared a contraction type glucose-sensitive mi- crogels for glucose sensing and a new type of mechanism was proposed in which glucose changes its swelling degree via changing the ionization degree or crosslink degree.[258] Here they ﬁrst prepared P(NIPAM-AAc) microgel and by re- acting with 2-acrylamidophenylboronic acid (2-AAPBA) in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hy- drochloride (EDC) target microgel P(NIPAM-2-AAPBA) was formed. In addition to glucose, the VPTT of the polymer de- creased with a decrease in the size of the polymer. Therefore, by measuring the particle size by DLS the amount of glucose can be calculated (Figure 62). In the next example, for the ﬁrst time, the same group synthe- sized a glucose sensor by introducing, a colloid crystal capable Adv. Funct.

The doped mi- crogel was larger than the host microgel. In the presence of glu- cose at pH 7.4 the doped microgel began to shrink and with an increase of glucose concentration, the size of the doped microgel decreased than the host microgel (Figure 63). This observation was conﬁrmed by examining the transmission spectra. The glu- cose concentration in the range 0–60 × 10−3 m can be measured. Further, a glucose sensor based on a similar concept was de- scribed by their group. [257] P(NIPAM-3-AAPBA) and 3-AAPBA create the doped microgel. Since the doped microgel was smaller Figure 63.

Swelling of doped microgels occurred in the presence of glucose at pH 8.5 (phosphate buﬀer), and the size diﬀerence between the two microgels was reduced. The size of two microgels becomes comparable at a particular glucose concentration, therefore eliminating the defects. Further, the addition of glucose increased the size of the doped micro- gel relative to the host microgel, causing a defect to appear once more, as detected by transmission emission (Figure 64). Peng and co-workers prepared a nanogel in order to develop a glucose sensor with low LODs and a visual output. [260] The nanogel was synthesized with a glucose-responsive VPBA and thermo-sensitive monomer NIPAM via emulsion precipitation polymerization. In ammonium chloride-ammonia buﬀer solu- tion (pH 9.50), the nanogel colloid formed a complex with glu- cose causing nanogel swelling which allowed the red-shift and the distinct change in the structure color from blue to green. The nanogel detected a very low concentration of 1 × 10−3 m of glu- cose. Another naked-eye glucose-detecting sensor was prepared by their group by introducing colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs) made from interpenetrating nanogels (IPN).[261] Poly(N- isopropylacrylamide)/poly(acrylic acid) nanogels were ﬁrst pre- pared followed by the formation of P(NIPAM-VPBA)@IPN-BAC nanogels with VPBA, NIPAM, and N,N′-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BAC) crosslinker, and the nanogels were allowed to self- assemble into colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs). The VPBA in the nanogel could complex with glucose, which allowed the swelling of the lattice space in the crystal structure and a rapid increase in the lattice distance. As the concentration of glucose increased from 0 to 2 mM, the color of CPCs changed from bright blue to green. Nanoparticle-based glucose sensors can also be prepared which contain PBA moiety. Fluorescent CdS QDs were immo- bilized with a PBA-containing polymer to prepare an optical glu- cose sensor. [124] Other ﬂuorescent CdS QDs incorporated which convert the biochemical signal into an optical signal correspond- ing to the amount of glucose. [125] Noble metal NPs, such as AuNPs were introduced in polymer chains for optical sens- ing and ability to improve storage ability and reusability.[262] Nanosized CDs are also used for their excellent optoelectronic property. [126] There was another example of using ZnO QDs for glucose sensing. [263] Inspired by the “ﬁshing” or “selec- tive capture and controllable detection” concept Qiao et al. fab- ricated poly(maleic anhydride-styrene-N-isopropylacrylamide-4- aminophenylboronic acid) P(MAn-St-NIPAM-PBA) to fabricate the nanoreactor for the detection of D-glucose (Glu) in the rat mi- crodialysates of brain ischemia.[264] Block copolymer P(MAn-St- NIPAM-PBA) was synthesized by the RAFT polymerization pro- cess followed by the enzyme (GOx) ﬁlled and Myo-ﬁlled nanore- actors were fabricated in the self-assembling method. The PBA unit in block copolymer selectively binds Glu and GOx in a nanoreactor converted Glu to D-glucono-𝛿-lactone and H2O2. The prepared H2O2 was used as a cosubstrate for a Myo- based catalyst to oxidize guaiacol into quinone, which was ob- served using UV−vis spectroscopy (Figure 65). At a temperature higher than LCST enzyme was blocked by shrinking of PNIPAM and so it exhibited “oﬀ” state. Additionally, the model selectively detects Glu over other saccharides in the range of 0.30−10.0 × 10−3 m with a LOD of 0.20 × 10 −3 m. The glucose in saliva was measured using AuNPs modi- ﬁed with polymer. In this context, Yang et al. fabricated an Au-decorated glass nanopore where the inner wall was mod- iﬁed with copolymer poly(3-(acryloylthioureido)phenylboronic Adv. Funct.

[265] In the presence of glucose by H-bonding interac- tion, the conformation was changed from a coiled to a stretched state leading to an increase in ionic ﬂux. Again, the pKa value of the corresponding polymer was 6.8 and upon the addition of glucose at pH 9 boronate copolymer became a polyanion with the ionic current change (Figure 66). The system selectively de- tected glucose over other biological molecules (xylose, fructose, galactose, mannose, sucrose, lactose, and maltose) with a LOD of 1 × 10 −9 m. PBA-based micro/nanogels usually take a long time to reach the de-swelling equilibrium under decreasing glucose concen- tration conditions. To overcome this problem a nanogel was prepared with Concanavalin A (ConA), as the glucose recog- nition moiety.[102] ConA is a plant lectin protein tetramer that consists of two dimers and has four binding sites for non-reducing D-glucose, D-mannose, and polysaccharide. Wei et al. introduced a microgel-based surface plasmon resonance transducer for glucose detection using ConA.[266] The micro- gel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-glycosyloxyethyl methacrylate (P(NIPAM-co-GEMA)) was synthesized using MBAM crosslinker via free radical precipitation polymerization followed by adding ConA through pendent glycosyl groups of microgel (Figure 67). ConA has a greater glucose aﬃnity than GEMA. Therefore, the deswelling microgel, in the presence of ConA again began to swell in the presence of glucose as ConA leached from the micro- gel to bind with glucose. This process was examined by monitor- ing the contraction/expansion process of the microgels bound to an Au surface via SPR. This process was observed up to 5 × 10−3 m glucose concentration. A glucose-responsive phenyl boronic moiety was typically in- cluded int the polymer backbone for designing glucose sensor systems. The polymer matrix can also be modiﬁed by includ- ing glucose oxidase. Many strategies were employed to produce glucose sensors using a glucose-responsive mechanism. For in- stance, AuNPs and CDs were utilized to track glucose. Glucose was detected with a LOD as low as 0.2 × 10−3 m using a PNIPAM- based sensor, and also sensed from complex mediums such as human saliva and rat brain with high selectivity. Therefore, the PNIPAM-based designed sensors have the potential of practical application. 3.1.2. Hydrogen Peroxide Sensing Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has a vital role in the regulation of many physiological processes and it is also a by-product of many metabolic processes in living systems. The variation of its concentration can aﬀect cell proliferation, death, and sig- nal transduction. [267] Hydrogen peroxide is also an important Adv. Funct.

PNI- PAM has taken an important role in peroxide sensing due to its temperature response character which increased the sensi- tivity of the sensor. Peroxide-sensitive ﬂuorescent Calcon dye as- semblies were reported to prepare a sensor. [174] Sensing based on photonic materials takes signiﬁcant attention due to their low cost and easy signal readout property. The Serpe group demonstrated a novel optical device named etalon where mi- crogel was sandwiched between two Au layers. Optical prop- erties vary depending on the distance between two Au lay- ers. To prepare a peroxide sensing etalon, ﬁrst a microgel was prepared via free radical precipitation polymerization with monomer NIPAM, AAc, and crosslinker MBAM.[268] Then fer- rocenylmethanol monomer was added to the microgel followed by etalon fabrication. When the microgel was exposed to H2O2, Fe 2+ of ferrocene oxidized to Fe3+, causing it to transition to a +1-charge state of ferrocene. The compound with +1charge was reported to interact with the polar amide group of the microgel resulting in a decrease in microgel diameter and the formation of a characteristic multipeak reﬂectance spec- trum (Figure 68). Peroxide emitted from the enzymatic re- action between glucose oxidase and glucose can be detected using this etalon device, and the device can be reused by the reduction of ferrocene done by exposure to the reducing agent. Another etalon device was fabricated by the same group intro- ducing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a P(NIPAM-co-AAc) mi- crogel instead of the ferrocene moiety for H2O2 sensing. [269] This was made possible by introducing Ag + to the etalons com- posed of deprotonated microgels, followed by its subsequent re- duction with NaBH4. AgNPs were decomposed in the presence of H2O2, which enabled the microgel layer to swell resulting in a red-shift in the reﬂectance peaks from the etalon and an in- crease in the intensity of the reﬂectance peaks (Figure 69). Addi- tionally, the NPs could be regenerated and reused at least seven times without losing performance eﬃciency. Peroxide sensors can be prepared by incorporating redox en- zymes into polymer-based ﬁlms such as hydrogel polymers, biopolymers, and polyelectrolytes. It can enhance the direct elec- tron exchange between the enzymes and underlying electrodes. Hemoglobin (Hb) shows a couple of well-deﬁned redox peaks with a formal potential of −0.371 V (vs SCE) and exhibits in- trinsic electro-catalytic activity toward H2O2. This property was used to prepare a composite ﬁlm containing MWCNTs. [118] An- other Hb-based peroxide sensor was fabricated by Zhou et al. using GO having good hydrophilicity, moderate conductivity, and excellent electrochemical properties.[270] Block co-polymer Adv.

Peroxide induced change in etalon.[269] poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-b-poly(2-acrylamidoethyl benzoate) (PNIPAM-b-PAAE) was fabricated using the RAFT process and mixed with GO to form PNIPAM-b-PAAE/GO. Then Hb was added to get PNIPAM-b-PAAE/GO/Hb (PGH) solution which was used to prepare a ﬁlm on GCE, marked as PGH/GCE. In the presence of H2O2, a signiﬁcant reduction peak was observed which suggested the reduction of peroxide in the presence of Hb. At temperature above LCST PNIPAM-b-PAAE underwent a de- hydrated state inducing “expansion-to-contraction” (Figure 70)of the PGH ﬁlm which resulted in wider linear detection ranges and lower LOD existing above 32 °C. The system detected H2O2 with a detection range of 0.1 to 3.72 μmol L−1 at that temperature. In parallel, Manivannan et al. designed an electrochemical sensor where the enzyme Hb was used with inorganic parti- cles, modiﬁed with PNIPAM, to prepare a composite for de- tecting H2O2. [271] To prepare the composite, ﬁrst a SiO2 disper- sion was treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) to form NH2-functionalized SiO2 microspheres (NH2-SiO2). Then 2-bromoisobutyrate-functionalized SiO2 microspheres (Br-SiO2) were prepared using 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BiBB) followed by adding NIPAM, methanol, water, and CuBr/CuBr2/PMDETA to prepare composite PNIPAM@SiO2 core–shell microspheres through surface-initiated ATRP. Finally, Hb was immobilized onto the surfaces of PNIPAM@SiO2 microspheres via hydropho- bic and 𝜋-𝜋 stacking interactions and modiﬁed on GCE to prepare Figure 70. Temperature-responsive volume change of polymer. Repro- duced with permission.[270] Copyright 2016, Springer Nature. the electrode (Figure 71). Electron transfer occurs between Hb and PNIPAM@SiO2 causing a redox peak at −0.38 V correspond- ing to Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox couple. H2O2 was reduced by Hb and reduction currents at −0.29 V increased linearly upon increasing the H2O2 concentrations at pH 7.2. The system detected H2O2 over a wide linear concentration range (0.1 × 10−3 m to 333 × 10 −3 m) with a LOD of 0.07 × 10−6 m. Fe3O4 NPs can be used as an alternative to enzymes in the fab- rication of peroxide sensors, due to their enzyme-like activity. In this context, Wang et al. reported a nonenzymatic switchable bio- electrocatalytic sensor for H2O2. [272] The ﬁrst PNIPAM microgel was synthesized via emulsiﬁer-free polymerization followed by mixing with Fe3O4 NPs to generate Fe3O4-PNIPAM microgels and a GCE was modiﬁed with it. At temperatures below the LCST of PNIPAM, due to swelling the Fe3O4 NPs were open to the elec- trode surface and the Fe3O4 NPs can catalyze oxidation reaction of H2O2, yielding the “on” state. Above the LCST the NPs were not exposed to H2O2 due to the collapsed polymer resulting in the “oﬀ” state (Figure 72). The fab- ricated system detected 0.005 × 10−6 mH2O2 at 26 °C by seeking an electrochemical response. Electrochemical changes resulting from peroxide reduction are a common technique for detecting H2O2.PNIPAMisof- ten applied to the electrode surface. These interfaces have been demonstrated to have temperature-controlled electro-catalysis or switchable/tunable interfacial electron transport. With a high de- gree of selectivity, the peroxide sensor can identify concentrations as low as 0.005 × 10 −6 m. The sensor has been used to detect per- oxide in actual samples, including milk and fruits. According to some reports, scientists have developed a low-cost peroxide sen- sor and assessed its application in biological enzymatic reactions. 3.1.3. Protein Sensing Proteins are another main class of biomolecules, having the largest size among all biomolecules and macromolecules. Its structure has one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins are very important as they are responsible for many functions within organisms, including catalyzing metabolic re- actions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing struc- ture to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Due to their vast applications, there is a tremendous interest in protein detection. The PNIPAM-based Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (48 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

Here aﬃn- ity to template molecules is done by copolymerization of the functional monomers and cross-linkers around them. Then re- moval of templates is done to form a cavity complementary to the template molecules. Lysozyme (N-acetylmuramide gly- canohydrolase), a single-chain protein consisting of 129 amino acids is detected using this method. Lysozyme in body tissues and secretions takes part an important physiological role in the innate immune system and the abnormal concentration of lysozyme in body ﬂuids and tissues causes diseases such as re- nal diseases, leukemia, and meningitis. Chen et al. reported a PNIPAM hydrogel-based molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for lysozyme detection. [273] Another PNIPAM hydrogel-based MIP was designed for lysozyme sensing.[99] Fang et al. incorpo- rated silanized CDs into MIP to prepare a ﬂuorescent probe us- ing their ﬂuorescence signal reporting ability. [274] Silica-coated CDs (CDs/ SiO2) were prepared. Then, the MIP-coated CDs/ SiO2 composites (CDs/SiO2/MIP) were synthesized via sur- face imprinting method with CDs/SiO2, NIPAM, AAm as the Figure 72. Fabrication of microgel with H2O2 response.

After removal of the template molecule, the MIP selectively bound lysozyme due to the similarity of cavity shape and size with lysozyme, inducing ﬂuorescence quenching of the CDs due to the transfer of electrons of the hydroxyl group of lysozymes into the amino group of CDs/SiO2/ MIP causing the energy of the CDs into the complex. The MIP detected lysozyme in body ﬂuids and tissues with a wider detection range (0.001–0.01 mg mL −1), a low LOD 0.55 μgmL−1, and a high selectivity. The sys- tem acted as a temperature-dependent “on-oﬀ” as at high temper- atures due to the shrinking of PNIPAM, lysozyme could not bind to the imprinted site and the ﬂuorescence intensity decreased. By introducing magnetic NPs (Fe3O4) into MIP, a lysozyme de- tector was synthesized which could separate lysozyme from egg whites depending on temperature and light, dual-dependent re- binding, and release characteristics for lysozyme. In this context, Jia et al. synthesized magnetic imprinted NPs by grafting nanogel on NPs.[275] At ﬁrst, the 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate group was added onto Fe3O4 NPs and with it MIPs were formed with thermoresponsive NIPAM, lysozyme (Lys) as the protein template, an azobenzene monomer (MAZoA) as the functional photo-sensitive monomer, AAm containing amino group, and N- [3-(dimethylamino) propyl]methylacrylamide (DMAPMA) con- taining positively charged tertiary amines and crosslinker MBAM via surface graft polymerization (Figure 74). Non-imprinted Fe3O4 NPs were also made using similar ma- terials as used in the previous example but without a template. The polymer contracted above the LCST at 37 °C, changing the shape of the imprinted sites and making it easier to capture the protein. However, below LCST, owing to polymer swelling, there was a weaker connection between the nanogel and the protein leading to its release. Without MIP, lysozyme can be sensed using a turbidimet- ric sensor array by introducing PNIPAM nanogel as protein receptors.[276] HereananogelP(NIPAM-co-MAA) was prepared via precipitation polymerization. Then using a carbodiimide- coupling strategy amine-containing molecules were linked to the carboxyl groups of MAA to introduce sulfate, guanidinium, sec- ondary amine, or primary amine groups (unmodiﬁed nanogels are referred to as R1 and modiﬁed nanogels are marked as R2– R5 corresponding to the ligands with which they were modiﬁed). The protein made a bond with nanogel by electrostatic interac- tions. The anionic nanogels (R1 and R2) preferentially interacted with high p I proteins, while the cationic nanogels (R4 and R5) Adv.

Interaction with nanogel caused particle agglutination or aggregation. Due to the larger size of these aggregates compared to individual particles, light scattering was increased and, consequently, increasing the tur- bidity of the solution. Turbidity changes were measured by mea- Figure 75. Structures of ligands used to modify P(NIPAM-co-MAA). Unmodiﬁed nanogels (R1) contain a carboxylic acid group. 2- aminoethyl hydrogen sulfate (AEHS, R2), agmatine sulfate (AGS, R3), N-methylethylenediamine (NMEDA, R4), and ethylene diamine dihydrochloride (ED, R5) were used to introduce sulfate, guanidinium, secondary amine, and primary amine functional groups, respectively.[276] suring the absorbance of the solution. Here without lysozyme, ten more proteins can be sensed, e.g., cytochrome c, trypsin, lactoferrin, myoglobin, hemoglobin, gamma globulins, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, ovomucoid, and fetuin. Additionally, the nanogel was able to detect lysozyme in tear ﬂuid. However, at low protein concentrations, the number of pro- teins per nanogel decreased and this is due to the misbalance between protein concentration and refractive index. Therefore, achieving a low LOD became hard. To overcome this limitation, they designed the nanogel P(NIPAM-co-MAA) (PNM) in a local- ized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based biosensor.[277] For this PNM coated silica gold nanoshells (AuNS@PNM) was pre- pared. A signiﬁcant red shift was seen as a result of proteins’ en- hanced electrostatic interactions with the PNM nanogel at higher protein concentrations. By using this technique, two protein biomarkers for chronic dry eye were identiﬁed: lactoferrin and lysozyme. Due to diﬀering pI values (lactoferrin 8.8, lysozyme 11.3), lactoferrin was sensed at a lower pH (5.5), whereas lysozyme was detected at a higher pH (7.4). Another example of protein is bovine serum albumin (BSA) derived from cows and is a basic component in blood. It is very commonly used in biochemical tests and can be detected using MIPs. The hy- drogel of PNIPAM is used to detect BSA using MIP.[99] Dong et al. prepared an MIP using SiO2 NPs for the recognition of BSA.[278] First silica NPs were formed and the ─COOH group was formed on them obtaining SiO2@COOH and coated with chi- tosan (CS). After that NIPAM and diammonium cerium (IV) ni- trate (CAN) was grafted to it forming SiO2@CS-g-NIPAM and the MIP was formed by adding AAm, template BSA, and crosslinker Adv. Funct.

Schematic representation of MIP prepared by Dong et al. Reproduced with permission.[278] Copyright 2019, Wiley-VCH. MBAM (Figure 76). A non-imprinted polymer (NIP) is also pre- pared without a template molecule. Here, BSA was incorporated in the MIP based on strong electrostatic attraction and the hy- drophobic interaction between SiO2@BSA-MIP and BSA and conﬁrmed by adsorption measurement. At a temperature higher than LCST, PNIPAM shrink and imprinted cavity were deformed which blocked BSA from attaching. The MIP can be used in the real sample with excellent speciﬁcity properties. Yang and co- workers introduced a nanogel for detecting multivalent protein binding (MPB) using SPR.[214] First P(NIPAM-co-AAc) nanogel was fabricated via radical polymerization in water followed by im- mobilizing biotin through EDC coupling. Initially, they check the system in the presence of streptavidin where it binds with four bi- otin molecules. This binding enhances the cross-linking degree of the nanogel network through MPB resulting in deswelling of the nanogels followed by an increase in the RI of the nanogel layer. These RI changes aﬀected the SPR signal which was not that much aﬀected by monovalent binding (Figure 77). Instead of bi- otin, antigen Fc-tagged PD-1 and protein A were used to detect PD-1 antibodies with a LOD down to 10 × 10−9 m. Hemoglobin (Hb) is one of the main components of red blood cells. It transports oxygen and carbon dioxide. Again, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) plays an important role in diabetes di- agnostics. Its deﬁciency causes anemia, palpitations, and lack of blood color. Therefore, Hb is very important in biological analysis. PNIPAM-based MIP draws wide attention for detec- tion of it. Zhao et al. fabricated a ﬂuorescent sensor by incor- porating silanized CDs (CD@SiO2) into MIP to detect bovine hemoglobin (BHb).[279] The silica-coated CD (CD@SiO2)was prepared ﬁrst then taking thermoresponsive NIPAM, functional monomer MAA, and template BHb molecular imprinted poly- mer was synthesized using the surface imprinting method and coated with CD@SiO2 to fabricate CD@SiO2@MIP (Figure 78). BHb caused ﬂuorescence quenching due to the special inter- actions of the template molecules with the imprinting cavities. Here temperature played as a switch of the MIP as at high tem- perature it acted as a hydrophobic part with weak ﬂuorescence signal. The sensor showed a detection range of 0.31–1.55 × 10−6 m and a LOD of 1.55 × 10 −6 m. Alternatively, CDs-based MIP was reported by Sun et al. to de- tect alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).[280] AFP, an oncofetal glycoprotein Adv. Funct.

The MIPs with diﬀerent compositions were prepared with vinyl-functionalized CDs (V- CDs) as transducer elements and support materials, AFP as the template protein, NIPAM and VPBA as thermo-responsive, and pH-responsive monomer, APS and MBAM as initiator and cross- linker, respectively (Figure 79). Under basic conditions and above LCST, VPBA units interact with the cis-diol groups of AFP and ex- hibit enhancement of ﬂuorescence spectra. The MIPs showed a good linear response to AFP in a concentration range of 10 to Figure 78. Preparation of MIP CD@SiO2@MIP. Reproduced with permission.[279] Copyright 2020, Springer Nature. 100 ng mL −1, with an LOD of 0.474 ng mL −1. Using PNIPAM- based MIP other proteins like myoglobin, [281] and ﬁbrinogen[282] can be detected. Peptides, units of protein,[283] could also be de- tected using the same method. Protein detection using the etalon device is another interest- ing work of the Serpe group.[113,114] They have demonstrated the use of PNIPAM microgels for the detection of Estradiol- 17𝛽 (E2) using the etalon device.[284] E2, considered one of the most active estrogens, is necessary for the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues. Varying the con- centration of it causes health problems like sexual precocity in young females, and feminization in males. As a result, detecting it is extremely vital. In this report poly(N-isopropylacrylamide- co-acrylic acid) [P(NIPAM-co-AAc)] microgels were formed via surfactant-free, free radical precipitation polymerization using cross-linker MBAM, and etalon device was fabricated using Au layer. Then the Au layer of etalon was modiﬁed with thiol- modiﬁed 75-mer anti-E2 DNA aptamer (E2-Ap75: 5′- HS-(CH2)6- ATACGAGCTTGTTCAATACGAAGGGA TGCCGTTTGGG CC- CAAGTTCGGC ATAGTGTGGTGAT AGTAAGAGCAATC-3′) and 35-mer anti-E2 DNA aptamers (E2-Ap35: 5′-HS-(CH2)6- AAGGGATGCCGTTTGGGCCC AAGTTCG GCATAGTG-3′)via S–Au binding. In the presence of E2 aptamer, etalon binds to it and forms a rigid structure that prevents salt or ions from passing through the microgel; however, when E2 ap- tamer is absent, it forms a loose structure that allows salt to pass through and causes a change in optical property (Figure 80). So, observing optical property E2 can be de- tected. The etalon exhibited a dynamic range of 0.9–200 pg mL −1 with a calculated LOD of 0.9 pg mL−1 (3.2 × 10 −12 m) E2, and the lowest measured concentration of E2 is 5.0 pg mL−1. Adv. Funct.

The same group in another example reported an etalon device having progesterone (P4) sensing ability. [285] P4 is an important steroid hormone due to participation in the reproduction cycle and is necessary for the maintenance of pregnancy in humans and animals. Here also P(NIPAM-co-AAc) microgel was prepared using temperature-ramp, surfactant-free, free-radical precipita- tion polymerization, and etalon was made by this microgel. Then anti-P4 antibody E2 was attached to a microgel with EDC and N- hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). In the presence of P4 microgels col- lapsed, forming a blue shift in the optical properties of the device. By observing the shift of the reﬂectance peaks the amount of P4 Figure 80. Response of etalon towards E2. Reproduced with permission.[284] Copyright 2018, Springer Nature. can be detected. The fabricated sensor showed a linear detection range of 0.28 to 30 ng mL −1 P4 with a LOD of 0.28 and 0.25 ng mL−1 at room temperature and 30 °C, respectively. A biosensor for mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), a glycopro- tein was prepared using an etalon device. [286] Here PNIPAM- co-N-(3-aminopropyl) methacrylamide hydrochloride (APMAH) microgel-based etalons coated with enzyme-responsive/reactive species were used to detect biomolecules. First, alkaline phosphatase-modiﬁed goat anti-mouse IgG (AP-GAM) (F(ab’)2 fragment speciﬁc to mouse IgG) and mouse IgG were mixed in solution, and after sometime unbound AP-GAM isolated in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld. The unbound AP-GAM was added to the microgel in the etalon device to neutralize the pos- itive charge APMAH on the microgel due to the degradation of a phosphate-containing polymer layer on top of the etalon pro- duces negative phosphate group which caused a change in re- ﬂection peak corresponding to mouse IgG (Figure 81). It has been demonstrated that the use of MIPs can lead to the development of highly sensitive and selective methods for identifying proteins and peptides, with a sensitivity increase of at least two times compared to non-imprinted polymers. Most of the time, the thermoresponsiveness of PNIPAM has been found to increase the sensor’s sensitivity. Since the majority of the ex- amples were assessed using real samples—such as serum, bod- ily ﬂuid, or tissue—and their low cytotoxicity was veriﬁed, these sensors have been demonstrated to be suitable for imaging living cells. The developed sensor showed strong selectivity and a LOD as low as 10 × 10 −9 m. 3.1.4. DNA Sensing Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA is the hereditary material in hu- mans and almost all other organisms. It consists of two polynu- cleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (54 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

Detection of DNA in body ﬂuids can provide the possibility of early disease diagnosis and hence the chance to improve quality of life. Scientists have re- ported many techniques and along with them, the thermorespon- sive PNIPAM-based system draws considerable attention. The Serpe group in their reports explored a device named etalon. Using this etalon DNA can be detected. [108,109] In another exam- ple, nucleobase containing PNIPAM was prepared for the DNA sensor. [287] A ﬂuorescent sensor was also prepared for the sens- ing of DNA.[288] Chen et al. prepared a DNA sensor by using a microﬂuidic device where PNIPAM was tethered on a silicon surface.[92,289,290] Their group designed a block copolymer that can identify DNA single-base mismatches.[291] Azido-terminated PNIPAM brushes were grafted onto thin Au ﬁlms on silicon as a bottom electrode and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) pre- senting a 4-pentynoic acid succinimidyl ester unit were grafted onto the azido-terminated PNIPAM brushes through a click reac- tion, forming PNIPAM-b-ssDNA copolymer brushes (Figure 82). The complex was stabilized via bio-multiple hydrogen bonds (BMHBs) by which the resistivity of the structures decreased by enhancing the proton transfer. Whereas, in the presence of DNA, a competition between BMHBs and complementary HBs occurred which caused phase transformation and inhibition of proton transfer followed by increasing resistance. Again, in the absence of a DNA base pair “proton leakage” occurred to decrease the resistivity at temperatures below the LCST for adenine and guanine units. Above LCST thymine and cytosine mismatches were identiﬁed due to disruption of the BMHBs at increased tem- peratures. 3.1.5. Other Biomolecules Sensing There are some other examples of biomolecules that can be de- tected by PNIPAM. Urea is the chief nitrogenous end-product of the metabolic breakdown of proteins in all mammals and some ﬁshes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise these days, making urea sensing a critical tool. Goh et al. introduced urease- loaded PNIPAM hydrogel to develop an osmotic urea sensor.[292] Figure 82. Fabrication of system with DNA sensitive mechanism. Repro- duced with permission.[291] Copyright 2017, Royal Society of Chemistry. The introduction of urea in a salt solution caused binding with urease and the osmotic pressure was increased corresponding to urea concentration using a multiphysics model. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic polysaccharides composed of several glucopyranose units. In comparison to 𝛼-CD and 𝛽-CD, 𝛾- CD has a larger internal cavity, higher bioavailability, and higher solubility. Therefore, it is widely used in the food and pharmaceu- tical industries. Wei et al. reported a microgel for 𝛾-CD detection using adsorption property.[293] Here poly(N-isopropylacrylamide- co-acryloylamidobenzo-12-crown-4) (PNB) microgel was pre- pared by the formation of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PNA) microgels followed by modiﬁcation benzo-12-crown- 4(B12C4) units via condensation reaction (Figure 83). Since the pore size of crown ether and 𝛾-CD are similar, the crown ether complex preferentially adsorbed 𝛾-CD, increasing the volume of the microgel. 3.2. Drug Sensing A drug is a chemical substance or construct that has a biologi- cal impact when consumed by a living organism. It has wide ap- plication in the biological system. Its wide range of applications makes the detecting process vital. PNIPAM-made systems can have the potential to detect drugs and the most popular method is a MIP based system. Glycopeptide antibiotics are utilized in the treatment of serious gram-positive bacterial infections. Chen et al. prepared ﬂuorescent MIP incorporating Mn-doped ZnS QDs as a ﬂuorescent probe for detecting telavancin, a semisyn- thetic glycopeptide antibiotic.[294] The MIP was synthesized with amino-capped Mn-doped ZnS QDs, VPBA, NIPAM, AAm, and mannose-tryptophan (MT) as a template. The boronic moiety presented here can bind with the template over glucose due to the shape exclusion of the imprinted cavity and ﬂuorescence in- tensity was increased. The temperature should be more than LCST as at low-temperature swelling of PNIPAM deformed the Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (55 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

The MIP showed good linear correlations over the concentration range of 3.0 to 300.0 μgL−1 and with a low LOD of 1.0 μgL−1. The electrochemical approach is an alternative to the MIP method for detecting drug molecules. Antipsychotic drug sensor consisting of PNIPAM microgel for antipsychotic drug Chlorpromazine (CPZ). [295] Here, in a ﬁrst step, a PNI- PAM microgel was prepared via a temperature-ramp, surfactant- free, free-radical precipitation polymerization method with MBAM cross-linker, and a GCEwas modiﬁed with the micro- gel (Figure 84). An oxidation peak was observed at 0.67 V in the presence of CPZ due to the direct electro-oxidation of nitrogen atoms in the CPZ structure. Due to the higher surface area of the PNIPAM microgel, it adsorbed CPZ molecules and oxidized them. The fabricated system exhibited sensitivity and LOD, 0.084 μA/μM/cm2 and 0.016 × 10 −6 m, respectively. Their group also published another electrochemical sensor for detecting the drug 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-ﬂuoro-1 hpyrimidine-2,4- dione, 5-FU). [296] 5-FU is one of the major antineoplastic agents used in chemotherapeutic regimens for metastatic colorectal, breast, stomach, pancreatic, and cervical cancer worldwide. Here conducting polymers, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was immobilized on the PNIPAM chain to get the di- rect electron transfer from the microgel to the electrode. First PDEOT was synthesized from DEOT monomer by oxidative polymerization and PNIPAM microgel was formed by seeded precipitation polymerization of NIPAM monomers in the pres- ence of MBAM crosslinker. Following that, PNIPAM microgel- encapsulated PEDOT was synthesized by seeded precipitation polymerization of NIPAM monomer in the presence of PE- DOT and ﬁnally, it was dispersed on GCE to get PNIPAM- PEDOT/GCE (Figure 85). An oxidative current was found at tem- peratures over LCST due to the electron exchange mechanism, Figure 84. Synthesis of microgel and oxidation of CPZ.[295] Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (56 of 71) © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de Figure 85. Synthesis of microgel with temperature-responsive “oﬀ-on” character. Reproduced with permission.[296] Copyright 2019, Elsevier Ltd. which decreased the distance between materials and the surface of GCE, resulting in an “on” state. The sensor exhibited an LOD of 15 × 10 −9 mat40 °C. Their group this time detected metoprolol (MTP) [2-propanol, 1-[4-(2-methoxyethyl)phenoxy]−3-[(-methylethyl)amino]-,(±)- ,[R-(R*,R*)]−2,3-dihydroxy butanediol ate] with a polymer nanocomposite using a nanocomposite.[297] MTP is a very pop- ular antihypertensive drug belonging to the class of 𝛽-blockers (𝛽(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists), used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism, angina, arrhythmia, hypertension, and myocardial infarction diseases. It is so sensitive that alittle extra intake may cause harmful eﬀects like the provocation of cardiac failure, bradycardia, fatigue, bronchospasm, hypoten- sion, and hypoglycemia. Here, the nanocomposite based on poly(styrene-co-N-isopropylacrylamide) hybrid tungsten dioxide (WO2@PS-co-PNIPAM) was synthesized by facile ultrasonic irradiation. The same technique was used here also, that is below LCST polymer chain extension buried electroactive sites of WO2 to occur electronic transfer and indicate the “oﬀ” state. However, above LCST, WO2 was underwent an electro-oxidation reaction, and the response current indicated “on” state (Figure 86). The composite exhibited a sensitivity of 2.21 μA/μM/cm2, a wide dy- namic range of 0.05–306 × 10−6 m, and a low LOD of 0.03 × 10−6 m for MTP. Using the same temperature-responsive “on-oﬀ” switch sulfamethazine [(4-amino-N-(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyri- midinyl)benzenesulfonamide, (SFZ)] was detected. [298] It is mainly used to provide relief from respiratory tract diseases and gastrointestinal in veterinary clinical treatment. However, Figure 86.

The detection process of SFZ. Reproduced with permission.[298] Copyright 2020, Elsevier Ltd. excessive intake can cause harmful eﬀects on the human body. First, P(NIPAM-co-MAA) was prepared by precipitation poly- merization and nanocomposite was designed with ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNPs) by coordination of carboxylic ─COOH groups with the surface of metal oxides. Then the GCE was modiﬁed with composite. Below the LCST the electroactive sites of Ru were closed to oxidation of SFZ leading to a “switch-oﬀ” state and above LCST due to the shrinking of polymer elec- troactive sites were exposed to oxidation of MGC leading to as “switch-on” state (Figure 87). The corresponding peak current refers to the concentration of MGC. The sensor exhibited a linear concentration of 0.01−491 × 10−6 mand averylow LODof5 × 10 −6 m SFZ at 40 °C in the real sample. Another electrochemical sensor was reported by Zhao et al. for sensing the drug paracetamol. [299] Paracetamol (N-acetyl-para- aminophenol or APAP), is a very popular antipyretic analgesic, commonly used for treating colds, headaches, fever, neuralgia, arthritis, and post-operative pain symptoms. However, exces- sive intake of APAP can result in liver damage and even coma or death in severe cases. Here electrochemical “on/oﬀ” detec- tion of APAP (paracetamol) was achieved using the thermosen- sitive PS-PNIPAM -PS, carboxylated multi-walled carbon nan- otubes (MWCNTs-COOH), and amino-functionalized graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs). Among them, MWCNTs provide ex- cellent electrochemical performance and electrocatalytic perfor- mance for sensors. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can en- hance the stability and dispersibility of carbon nanotubes, and promote close bonding of the polymer and MWCNTs. The tri- block polymer was prepared with RAFT polymerization. Then the obtained PS-PNIPAM-PS/MWCNTs-GQDs were dropped onto GCE to form PS-PNIPAM-PS/MWCNTs-GQDs/GCE electrodes. At the temperature below LCST due to stretching the electroactive sites of the carbon nanocomposite were buried and consequently APAP could not penetrate through the polymer to achieve elec- tronic exchange, representing the “closed” state (Figure 88). Whereas above the LCST, the polymer shrank to expose the elec- troactive sites and enlarge background currents, the paracetamol underwent the redox reaction normally and generated the re- sponse current, representing the “on” state. The sensor exhibited a wide detection range (0.1–7.0 × 10−6 m and 7.0–103.0 × 10 −6 m) and a low LOD of 66 × 10−9 m for paracetamol. To design drug sensors, scientists took advantage of the reduc- tion of functional groups present in drug molecules. GCEs fea- turing PNIPAM layers and their electrochemical response were notable means for detection. Below its LCST the polymer layer covers the GCE surface and inhibits the electron transfer to the GCE surface. Whereas, the opposite phenomena were observed above the LCST which introduced oﬀ-on characteristics. The sen- sor applicability was tested with real samples such as milk, hu- man urine, and human blood serum, and the results were sat- isfactory. The developed sensor demonstrated a low LOD of 5 × 10 −9 m, good selectivity, and a wide detection range. 3.3. Biomarker Sensing Biomarkers are molecules that measure a biological state. They are indicative of normal biological processes, pathogenic pro- cesses, or pharmacologic responses to therapeutic interven- tion, and easily monitored by using blood, urine, or soft tis- sue samples. PNIPAM-based systems were prepared which ex- hibits responsive character in the presence of biochemical stim- uli and can sense the biomarkers. Adenosine is utilized as a possible biomarker for monitoring the progress of lung can- cer. Wang et al. synthesized AgNPs-embedded PNIPAM electro- spun nanoﬁber mats to detect the biomarker adenosine in urea solutions using SERS, which is a powerful technique for the ultrasensitive detection of biological and chemical species. [300] At ﬁrst, PNIPAM/2- aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AEMA) copolymer (PNIPAM-NH2) was prepared via radical Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (58 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

Again, after adding AgNPs to the PNIPAM-NH2 so- lution, AgNP/PNIPAM nanoﬁbers were synthesized by electro- spinning. Finally, AgNP/PNIPAM nanoﬁbers mats were formed by adding glutaric dialdehyde (GA) which acted as a crosslinker (Figure 89). Above LCST, the hydrophobic PNIPAM entraps more hydrophobic adenosine and excludes more hydrophilic urea molecules with the greatest enhancement in SERS spectra. The fabricated system exhibited a LOD as low as 10 −7 m. Lactate is a biomarker for cellular anaerobic metabolism or gly- colysis. It acts as an energy storage molecule produced during physical exertion and low muscle oxygen. Mugo and Dhanjai de- tected lactate in sweat by preparing an imprinted polymer.[222] In the salt sensing section, we have discussed its structure. Lactate responsiveness was achieved by modifying the surface of PNI- PAM@CNC/CNT with lactate imprinted PANI polymerized in the presence of PBA. The PBA unit made a bond with lactate and due to the matching of imprinted cavities lactate bounded with MIP and capacitance was increased. Due to insulation, PNIPAM increased electron transfer resistance. The system exhibited an LOD as 0.10 ± 0.04 × 10 −3 m, and a limit of linearity of approxi- mately25 × 10 −3 m. Figure 89.

Biomarker human immunoglobulin G (H-IgG) can indi- cate diseases such as primary or secondary immunodeﬁciency and infection diseases. Zhao et al. fabricated a hydrogel grat- ing immunosensor for detecting the biomarker human im- munoglobulin G (H-IgG).[301] First, vinyl-modiﬁed H-IgG and goat anti-human immunoglobulin G (GAH-IgG) were syn- thesized with previously prepared silanized glass slides and N-acryloxysuccinimide. Then adding NIPAM monomer and biocompatible crosslinker tetra-arm star-polyethylene glycol- acrylamide (PEG-AAm) hydrogel grating was formed (Figure 90). Primarily GAH-IgG made a bond with pendant H-IgG. However, upon the introduction of free H-IgG, the pendent GAH-IgG in the hydrogel interacts with it and the binding constant is higher than the previous one. Therefore, the previously formed com- plex started decomplexation, and swelling of hydrogel occurred. Therefore, the refractive index and diﬀraction eﬃciency changed. Observing this optical change H-IgG can be detected with an LOD as low as 1.3 × 10 −8 m. The use of the thermoresponsive polymer PNIPAM has not been investigated extensively in the ﬁeld of biomarkers. How- ever, novel MIP approaches and an antigen–antibody association technique were used to detect several biomarkers. The applicabil- ity of the fabricated sensor was utilized with a real sweat sample, showing satisfactory results. The LOD was noted as 0.1 × 10−9 m for lactate (biomarker) with high selectivity. The sensor’s ap- plicability was veriﬁed in lake water, tap water, and milk samples Figure 91. Preparation of PNIPAM@AuNRs composites. Reproduced with permission.[304] Copyright 2020, Elsevier Ltd.

Living Cell Detection Bacterial living cells have been detected by using PNIPAM. The hydrophilic to hydrophobic transfer in physiological temperature allows bacteria growth. Currently, the majority of diseases are caused by infection. As a result, the need for pathogen detection grows every day. The use of PNIPAM over other systems gets an advantage due to its sensitivity at physiological temperature. Khan et al. reported an electrically-receptive membrane by com- bining graphene-nanoplatelet (GR) with thermo-responsive poly- mer (PNIPAM) for detecting bacterial strains (E. coli, S. Mutans, and B. Subtilis). [302] Electrically receptive membrane graphene- nanoplatelet (GR) combined with thermo-responsive polymer (PNIPAM) to get a composite using the optimized spin-coating technique. Interdigitated microelectrodes (IDμE) were prepared on a thin layer of PNIPAM-GR composite by depositing Au elec- trodes. In the presence of bacteria, the polymer shrinks which makes a change in the electrical properties of GR. Resistance in- creased in Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), whereas resistance in Gram-positive bacteria (B. subtilis and S. mutans) decreased by about 10.31 ± 2.43% and 37.88 ± 5.25% percent, respectively, compared to E. coli. The system exhibited a wide range of con- centration 101–10 5 cells mL −1 and a lower LOD of 5 cells mL−1. Highly branched PNIPAMs were used to identify Gram- positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). In this context, Swift et al. synthesized the polymer using self-condensing re- versible addition–fragmentation transfer polymerization (SCVP- RAFT). [303] Where, Nile red was added to the main chain, and Vancomycin was added at the end of the chain. The ﬂuores- cence intensity was increased in bacteria due to the use of highly branched PNIPAM. 3.5. Pesticide Sensing Pesticides are introduced to control pests, mostly killing caterpillars and other critters that feed on crops. However, pesticides cause severe eﬀects on several other species besides their intended targets, including humans. Pesticides contain a wide range of compounds including insecticides, fungicides, Figure 93. Fabrication of electrode with the detection process.

Due to their harmful eﬀects, most of the developed countries have banned the use or import of produce treated with speciﬁc pesticides. Considering their harmful eﬀects, careful detection and quantiﬁcation techniques are needed, preferably with a straightforward readout. Also here, PNIPAM has been explored as a material in the development of SERS, electrochemical, and pesticide sensors, which will be outlined in detail below. By loading PNIPAM on AuNPs, SERS microsensors were produced for detecting eﬀective dynamic SERS substrates malachite green. [304] Using the electrochem- ical method pesticides can be detected. For this purpose, the excellent conductive property of polyaniline (PANI) was utilized and Cu NPs were taken for using their stability, and sensitivity to make composite materials with PNIPAM. [305] In another example, PdNPs are immobilized on PNIPAM due to their excellent electrocatalytic activities and are used for pesticide detection.[306] Carbon nanoﬁbers (CNFs) also can be used due to their conductive property and PNIPAM was grafted on it to make it more useful for sensory use for pesticides. [307] Immo- bilizing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) molecules into the PNIPAM matrix can lead to the formation of thermosensitive ECL hydrogels which can detect pesticides using a variation of electrochemiluminescence property. [308] The fungicide malachite green (MG) is harmful and causes serious risk due to its teratogenicity, mutagenicity, and carcino- genesis. Hu et al. introduced surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using AuNRs for the detection of MG in ﬁsh ﬁllets. [304] They ﬁrst created AuNRs utilizing a seed-mediated growth tech- nique in the presence of CTAB, as well as a PNIPAM microgel. The interaction of positively charged CTAB on AuNRs with neg- atively charged PNIPAM microgel produced PNIPAM@AuNRs nanocomposites (Figure 91). For SERS, prominent enhancement from localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on the sur- face of nanostructures, while surface-enhanced resonance Ra- man scattering (SERRS) provided additional enhancement ef- fect through molecular resonance for analytes that contain chro- mophore with the electronic transition at the wavelength near the excitation wavelength. Above the LCST due to the collapsed state of the nanocomposite, the density of “hot-spots” was increased, so SERS intensity was increased signiﬁcantly. Besides MG, the additives, sodium cyclamate (SC) and sodium saccharin (SS) can be detected. The LOD was 1.3 × 10 −9 m for MG, 5.8 × 10 −9 mfor SC, and 3.5 × 10−8 m for SS, respectively. Herbicides are another example of pesticides, which can also cause prominent and substantial health issues when irrespon- sibly released into the environment. Mutharani et al. prepared a composite sensing ﬁlm (PNIPAM/PANI-Cu) by mixing PNI- PAM, the conducting polymer poly(aniline), Cu(NO3)2.3H2O via chemical polymerization method and drop cast onto bare GCE to prepare an electrochemical device to detect herbicides, aclonifen (AFN) or 2-chloro-6-nitro-3-phenoxyaniline.[305] The ca- thodic peak was shown due to the reduction of the ─NO2 group to ─NHOH group with the four electrons (e−) and four pro- tons (H+)(Figure 92). The cathodic peak current was recorded by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The sensor exhibited a two-detection range (0.01–10 × 10 −6 m and 18–76 × 10 −6 m) with the low LOD was found to be 0.009 × 10 −6 m. The authors demon- strated that at a temperature lower than LCST no signiﬁcant signal was formed owing to the obstacle of the polymer and diﬃculty in changing electrons during the AFN reduction pro- cess. Whereas, at a temperature above the LCST, signiﬁcant Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (62 of 71) © 2024 The Authors.

Alternatively, the same group introduced an electrochem- ical sensor for the detection of organophosphorus pesticide paraoxon-ethyl (PEL) based on a GCE modiﬁed with a com- posite material containing palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs). [306] The cross-linked PNIPAM-Chitosan microgel was synthesized by a surfactant-free emulsion polymerization method by MBAM crosslinker. Then PdNPs were synthesized and microgel was dec- orated with it to make a composite. Finally, the composite was Figure 96. Fabrication of aerogel and application in humidity sensing.

The PNIPAM mi- crogel stabilized the composite by electronic interaction between positively charged chitosan and negatively charged PNIPAM, resulting in the decrease of size of PNIPAM. In the presence of PEL prominent cathodic peak and redox couple observed which is attributed to the reduction of PEL involves a transfer of four electrons (4e−) and four protons (4H +) leading to the formation of phenylhydroxylamine. By using diﬀerential pulse voltammetry, the model detected PEL in bok choy and water in the 0.01 × 10−6 m to 1.3 × 10 −3 m PEL concentration range with a LOD of 0.7 × 10−6 m(Figure 93). Their team also developed a carbon nanoﬁber (CNF)-based sen- sor to detect another neonicotinoid pesticide, clothianidin (CLD), electrochemically.[307] They used AIBN to generate a radical on the surface of the CNFs, which then initiated the polymeriza- tion with an ultrasonic horn to prepare covalently grafted CNFs- g-PNIPAM using the “grafting-from” strategy and adding it on GCE. In the presence of CLD two peak currents were observed, peak I current due to the reduction of ─NO2 group in CLD to ─NHOH group, and peak II ascribed to the further reduction of ─NHOH group to an ─NH2 group. At higher temperatures, PNIPAM shrinks and blocks electron transfer from CLD to CNF showing the “oﬀ” state. The system detected CLD with a sensitiv- ity of 2.32 μA/μM/cm2 with an LOD of 0.03 × 10 −6 m(Figure 94). Sun et al. reported a novel photocontrolled thermosensitive electrochemiluminescence hydrogel (PT-ECL hydrogel) for de- tecting the pesticide isocarbophos (ICP). [308] First T-ECL was pre- pared with NIPAM, one split aptamer (Apt1: acrydite-modiﬁed aptamer), and Ru(bpy)32+ via free radical polymerization. An- other split aptamer (Apt2: thiol-modiﬁed aptamer) was conju- gated with AuNRs to form AuNRs-Apt2. Finally, PT-ECL was formed by mixing T-ECL and AuNRs-Apt2. In the presence of ICP, the conjugation of two split aptamers induced the ECL−resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) between the Au nanorods and the Ru(bpy)32+ centers. However, upon exposure to NIR light, the photothermal eﬀect of AuNRs initiated the shrink- age of the hydrogel, resulting in the enhancement of the ECL- RET (Figure 95). The system exhibited ICP detection with a low LOD of 20 × 10 −12 m and a wide linear range from 50 × 10 −12 m to 4 × 10 −6 m, with great stability and repeatability. Similar to “drug sensing,” the electrochemical method is used to detect pesticides. Here also the electron transfer phenomena are utilized to design the sensor. Electric conductive AuNR, CNF, and GCE were mixed to PNIPAM. The thermoresponsive na- ture controls the interaction between the pesticide and electric conductive moiety. Bok Choy extract water samples were tested to check the presence of pesticides. The designed sensor demon- strated the LOD value as 0.07 × 10−9 m and with proper design that can be used in the food industry. 3.6. Miscellaneous A PNIPAM-based humidity sensor was designed by Ali et al.[309] They took advantage of the conductivity of AuNPs and the high surface area of a highly porous structure hybrid PNIPAM/AuNPs aerogel. This aerogel-based humidity sensor was used to de- tect human breath in diﬀerent states such as normal breath, fast breath, and deep breath, or by diﬀerent individuals such as the person in illness, smoking, and normal. AuNPs were pre- pared and from it, PNIPAM/AuNPs hydrogels were synthesized with NIPAM monomer. PNIPAM/AuNPs hydrogel formed PNI- PAM/AuNPs aerogel which did the sensing (Figure 96). The aero- gel having a hydrophilic group made a hydrogen bond with wa- ter. During the breathing process, the variance of water vapor was observed whereby increasing water vapor content increased the conductivity of the aerogel. Using this property a wearable sensor was prepared. Visualization of microwaves is another fascinating use of the PNIPAM-based technology.[310] Nakamitsu et al. introduced poly- diacetylene (PDA) in PNIPAM hydrogel.[310] Upon irradiation of microwaves, the color change of PDA occurred through heating of water in the hydrogel and subsequent volume shrinkage and exhibited the color change. Surfactants are a wide range of chemicals that are charac- terized by their amphiphilic nature as they contain hydrophilic Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024, 34, 2402432 2402432 (64 of 71) © 2024 The Authors. Advanced Functional Materials published by Wiley-VCH GmbH www.advancedsciencenews.com www.afm-journal.de and hydrophobic parts together. They are widely used in wash- ing, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. Nevertheless, their extensive use causes damage depending on their concen- tration and so their detection draws attention in modern times. Ionic surfactants can also be detected using a copolymer of PNI- PAM. In this context, Thivaios and co-workers designed poly(N- isopropylacrylamide-co-2,4-diphenyl6-(4-vinylphenyl) quinoline) (P(NIPAM-co-SDPQ)) (Figure 97). [311] The authors exploited the emissive properties of the SDPQ dye to detect surfactants selec- tively. At 22 °C and acidic conditions, the protonated form of SDPQ showed intense emission, and at a higher temperature, a weak band corresponding to the unprotonated form was pre- dominated. Upon addition of SDS, the band corresponding to the unprotonated form disappeared and the red shift of the band ob- served corresponds to the protonated structure. However, in the presence of an anionic surfactant at a low temperature, the emis- sion band corresponding to protonated form was observed and persisted until the concentration reached the critical aggregation concentration (cac) value. Further, increased concentration leads to a band corresponding to an unprotonated form. The authors used N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAM) to show the thermore- sponsive character. Studies have shown that sensors can be developed with sen- sitivities and detection limits appropriate for monitoring the an- alytes discussed in this section. A number of intriguing appli- cations for the sensor were explored, including noise identiﬁca- tion, voice recognition, and song note recognition. These appli- cations show promise for use in ﬂexible wearable devices for hu- man health monitoring and other advanced applications that will be readily portable in the near future. In the case of surfactant de- tection, the proposed design can be utilized to quantify cationic surfactants in daily items, such as hair conditioners and sham- poos, as well as in highly polluted water samples. 4. Conclusion One of the major topics in polymer science are stimuli- responsive polymers. Among them, PNIPAM is the most re- searched, and their LCST around body temperature, as well as their appealing and tunable properties, make them an excellent choice for a variety of in vivo and in vitro applications. The ap- plications of sensing and bio-sensing are discussed in depth in this review. The described polymers were made utilizing a num- ber of processes, e.g., ATRP, RAFT, and free radical polymer- ization. In certain situations, the sensor tag was added to the polymers by post-polymerization modiﬁcation. The sensors per- formed admirably in terms of selectivity and sensitivity. Despite their accomplishments, PNIPAM-based sensors experienced cer- tain diﬃculties in practical implementations. In this context, the fabrication of sensors on an industrial scale is a primary major challenge that should be cheap in cost and should be without any cracks and defects. However, a prevalent issue is the slow response time and mechanical strength, both of which are ma- jor roadblocks to their continued growth. For PNIPAM-based hy- drogels, a basic requirement is eﬀectively dissipating mechani- cal energies under large deformations while maintaining origi- nal conﬁgurations. By changing diﬀerent factors such as degree of crosslinking, initial monomer concentration, polymerization temperature, test temperature, and swelling degree scientists are trying to improve the mechanical strength. Reusability is another main condition for practical application, if the thermorespon- sive cycle or heating/cooling cycle provides durability is less than 100 times then it is quite hard to use in real conditions. There- fore, in practice, there is still a long way to go before we can use these polymers in our daily lives. If we want to use them for health monitoring or as wearable devices then it has to be suf- ﬁciently biodegradable with selectivity and sensitivity. PNIPAM homopolymers are intrinsically not biodegradable, unlike other natural polymers like chitosan, cellulose, and gelatine. This can lead to long-term bioaccumulation at the implantation site. How- ever, it is noncytotoxic in many biological applications, and when utilized as sensors typically very small quantities of materials are necessary. As a result, the main application area appears to be in healthcare systems for biosensing purposes and reusable sensors for a broad range of applications, rather than commodity single- use applications for textiles or food. Nonetheless, there is a long road ahead to go from initial proof-of-concept to real-world ap- plications. Stimuli-responsive polymers feature a low responsiv- ity rate, which may be in the order of an hour. To overcome this challenge, we shall need to consider the alteration of the mechan- ical properties (stress, elasticity modulus) and the micro/ nano structure (size, shape, porosity, and thickness) of the materials. As a result, PNIPAM has not been employed on a regular basis, and additional research into PNIPAM-based polymer sensors is required. To increase the use of PNIPAM-based smart sensors, in the future, more attempts shall be required to construct novel structures and enhance their properties with the integration of multi-functionality (e.g., multi-response, self-healing, and self- power) into the PNIPAM-based system. Therefore, cooperation across disciplines is required. Accelerating research in this ﬁeld is necessary to ensure that innovations meet public demand. We may anticipate that merging the eﬀorts of multidisciplinary specialists from various backgrounds will shed new light on the potential uses of PNIPAM-based sensor systems. We do foresee that PNIPAM-based sensors will most likely excel at (medical) applications where portability is a key feature, providing an ac- cessible technology in environments with limited infrastructure.
