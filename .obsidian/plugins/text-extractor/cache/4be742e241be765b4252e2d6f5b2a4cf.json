The fluorescence intensity was plotted against irradiation time (Figure 2b). The 'O, generation was depicted with an exponential function that corresponded to a pseudo first-order process. The 'O, generation curve was fitted with the following equation: L= A(1 - ™) 0) where ‏ع1‎ is fluorescence intensity and t represents irradiation time, while A and k are fitting parameters (for detailed derivations, see SI).
