As a common material for wound healing, dressings accelerate wound healing and prevent external wound infections. Hydrogels have become a hot topic in wound-dressing research because of their high water content, good biocompatibility, and adjustable physical and chemical properties. Intelligent hydrogel dressings have attracted considerable attention because of their excellent environmental responsiveness. As smart polymer hydrogels, thermosensitive hydrogels can respond to small temperature changes in the environment, and their special properties make them superior to other hydrogels. This review mainly focuses on the research progress in thermosensitive intelligent hydrogel dressings for wound healing. Polymers suitable for hydrogel formation and the appropriate molecular design of the hydrogel network to achieve thermosensitive hydrogel properties are discussed, followed by the application of thermosensitive hydrogels as wound dressings. We also discuss the future perspectives of thermosensitive hydrogels as wound dressings and provide systematic theoretical support for wound healing. Introduction The skin is the rst line of defense that protects the human body from external bacteria and viruses, and its integrity is extremely important for human safety. 1 When the integrity of the skin is compromised, patients experience discomfort, including pain, bleeding, inammation, delayed healing, scar- ring, and even death.2,3 Wound healing is the basic stage of skin injury reconstruction. It is a dynamic and overlapping process, usually divided into four continuous and possibly overlapping processes: hemostasis, inammation, proliferation, and remodeling (Fig. 1).4,5 These processes are regulated by complex networks comprising various cells and biological mediators.6,7 Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the diﬀerent wound healing phases: (a) normal skin; (b) hemostasis involves the promotion of platelets and formation of clots; (c) inﬂammation recruits leukocytes to the wound site to release cytokines; (d) the proliferation phase involves angio- genesis and extracellular matrix production; (e) the remodeling phase involves the organization and contraction of the extracellular matrix.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Nanoscale Adv.,2023, 5,6017–6037 | 6017 Nanoscale Advances REVIEW View Article OnlineView Journal | View Issue Studies have conrmed that temperature, pH, and other factors aﬀect wound healing. 8–12 Wound dressings protect wounds from infection by absorbing osmotic uid and isolating the external environ- ment. 13,14 Traditional dressings, such as gauze, cotton wool, and bandages can stop bleeding, absorb wound exudate, and protect the wound from bacterial infection; however, they do not have antibacterial or anti-inammatory functions15,16 and may cause adhesion scabs and even hinder the wound healing process.17,18 Compared to traditional medical dressings, hydrogels have the advantages of a three-dimensional network structure, strong water absorption, and the maintenance of a moist environment in the wound to reduce the infection rate and accelerate wound healing; 19 as such, they have become a research hotspot in the eld of wound dressing. More importantly, hydrogel dressings can be endowed with excellent properties through structural design and functional integration,20 thus playing an important role in the wound healing process. Thermosensitive hydrogels are smart polymer hydrogels that undergo phase transitions under external temperature stimu- lation and have good biocompatibility and mechanical prop- erties.21 The gelation of thermosensitive hydrogels is triggered by temperature, and they exhibit a phase transition at the crit- ical solution temperature. Once the desired temperature is reached, known as the sol–gel transition, hydrogels form immediately.22 The temperature-induced sol–gel transition is safer in vivo and is more suitable for injection systems because it does not require denaturing crosslinkers,23 leading to an easier and more economical process.24,25 They have excellent temperature sensitivity, drug delivery,26–28 cell loading,29,30 protein delivery,31,32 and gene therapy. 33,34 As a free-owing liquid before low-temperature gelation, the hydrogel precursor solution can be injected into the wound area to quickly ll irregular defects under physiological conditions, form a gel, and ll any irregular wound site or deep wound.35 In addition, encapsulation in the ow state allows the therapeutic agent to be evenly dispersed in the hydrogel, whereas the rapid sol–gel transition at body temperature prevents the initial burst release of the therapeutic agent, thus controlling the release behavior.36 These features are key to their application in human medicine,37 particularly in the eld of wound dressing. However, a system- atic review of thermosensitive hydrogel wound dressings has not been conducted. Herein, we summarize the progress in thermosensitive hydrogel wound dressings and discuss the polymers used in these dressings. The mechanisms of temperature sensitivity are reviewed and we discuss the diﬀerent types of thermosensitive hydrogels and their applications in diﬀerent wounds. Finally, we look ahead to the future development of thermosensitive hydrogels for wound-healing applications and make recommendations. Common thermosensitive materials An ideal wound dressing needs to be biocompatible and non- sensitive, with appropriate adhesion and mechanical proper- ties, able to eﬀectively cover the entire irregular wound, absorb the exudate tissue uid in time, ensure the environmental humidity of the wound, allow gas exchange, and prevent bacterial infection of the wound, so that it can be easily replaced to alleviate the pain of patients in the process of wound management.38,39 Thermosensitive biomaterials are novel smart materials for preparing thermosensitive hydrogels. These sources can be divided into natural and synthetic polymer materials (Fig. 2a). 40 Natural bioactive polymers Natural bioactive polymers are oen used as wound dressings due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability.41,42 The most commonly used natural bioactive polymers for thermosensitive hydrogels are chitosan,43,44 cellulose45,46 and gelatin. 47,48 Chitosan (CS) is a polycation biodimer that has a wide range of sources, and its structure consists of an N-acetylglucosamine group linked by a b-1,4-glycosidic bond and glucosamine resi- dues (Fig. 2b).49 CS exhibits good histocompatibility, biode- gradability, adhesiveness, antimicrobial activity, and low cytotoxicity.50–53 Because of these valuable features, CS has been widely used in the elds of medicine and biology.52,54 However, because of the slow temperature response and low mechanical strength of chitosan, it usually needs to be improved by combining it with other substances.36 Common chitosan ther- mosensitive hydrogels include chitosan–sodium glycer- ophosphate thermosensitive gels, chitosan gra gels, sulydryl chitosan hydrogels, and chitosan/collagen gels.55 Previous studies have shown that CS activates platelets and macro- phages, resulting in excellent blood characteristics.56 It can also promote the release of vascular endothelial growth factors, thereby promoting the formation of blood vessels and acceler- ating repair.57 In addition, chitosan exhibits excellent antibac- terial properties that can reduce the probability of wound Fig. 2 (a) Common classiﬁcation of thermosensitive materials; the structural formula of (b) chitosan; (c) cellulose; (d) gelatin; (e) polox- amer; (f) poly(N-isopropylacrylamide); (g) polyethylene glycol. 6018 | Nanoscale Adv.,2023, 5,6017–6037 © 2023 The Author(s).

The CS hydrogel dressing has the characteristics of high repair eﬃciency, simple design and preparation, and has potential value in the eld of wound dressing.54 Cellulose, which has been used for a long time and has a long history, is the main material used in traditional gauzes. Cellulose derivatives are biological macromolecules containing glucose molecules connected by b-1,4-glycosidic bonds (Fig. 2c). Hydroxypropyl cellulose and methyl cellulose are representative polymers used in cellulose-based thermosensitive hydrogels. Cellulose-based thermosensitive hydrogels are widely used as biomedical materials because of their hydrophilicity, biocom- patibility, biodegradability, and nontoxicity.21 At the structural level, cellulose is an ideal material for synthesizing biocom- patible hydrogels because it easily modies functional groups.59–61 The high biocompatibility and functional structure of cellulose polymer allows cellulose nanocomposites to be combined with various antibacterial agents.62,63 Oscar et al. developed a multifaceted formulation based on CNT-containing cellulose–chalcone, which can sustain the release of therapeutic substances with antimicrobial and wound-healing properties.64 Hydrogels can potentially be utilized to treat complex wounds owing to their improved wound-healing properties and prevention of potential infections. Gelatin is a natural protein derived from the hydrolysis of collagen; its molecular chain contains a large number of active functional groups (Fig. 2d). Gelatin is highly biocompatible and biodegradable in a physiological environment.47,65 Although mainly derived from animals, the digestive process confers gelatin very low antigenicity, with the formation of harmless metabolic products upon degradation while in body.66,67 When the temperature is below 25 °C, an aqueous gelatin solution solidies due to the formation of triple helices and a rigid three- dimensional network.68 At the physiological temperature, the physically formed hydrogels are dissolved. 69 Therefore, gelatin is oen chemically crosslinked or combined with other poly- mers resulting in hydrogels that are stable at 37 °C. Studies have reported thermoresponsive hydrogel systems for drug delivery by combining gelatin with a chitosan/Pluronic mixture70,71 to promote wound healing. Synthetic polymers Synthetic materials include poloxamers,72,73 poly(N-iso- propylacrylamides)74,75 and polyethylene glycol.76,77 Poloxamer is a synthetic amphiphilic copolymer78,79 consisting of a poly(- ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO–PPO–PEO) triblock copolymer (Fig. 2e),80 and the number of molecules can be adjusted to aﬀect their hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity. Poloxamer, copolymers with good amphipa- thicity, double responsiveness, and biocompatibility, have important applications in the eld of synthetic dressings.81,82 Poloxamer hydrogel dressings have good elasticity and plasticity and can closely t wounds to isolate bacteria. Their transparent texture can also be used to observe the condition of the wound while simultaneously keeping the wound moist, which is especially suitable for dry wounds, such as burns.83,84 Poloxamer hydrogels have good dual responsiveness (pH and temperature) and biocompatibility and can bind to the phospholipid bilayer of cells to protect the cell membrane and promote the expres- sion of growth factors and the proliferation of broblasts, thereby accelerating wound healing.85–87 Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a temperature- sensitive polymer polymerized from the monomer N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) via free-radical solution polymerization.88 The molecular chain of PNIPAM contains both hydrophobic isopropyl (–CH(CH3)2) groups and hydrophilic amide (–CONH–) groups in its structure (Fig. 2f).89 Polymer molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other because of hydrogen bonding with water molecules. PNIPAM dissolves in water to form a solution at room temperature and precipitates aer increasing the temperature.90,91 This property makes PNIPAM suitable for biomedical applications, such as controlled wound dressings, drug delivery systems, and engineering scaﬀolds.92–94 Jiang et al. developed a new hydrogel, acryloyl-lysine (A-Lys), which was incorporated into poly(ethylene glycol)-crosslinked PNIPAM.95 It exhibits good biological activity while maintaining its swelling properties and thermal reaction behavior. Polyhexamethylene biguanide, an antimicrobial agent, was loaded onto hydrogels. These materials can promote wound healing and provide active antimicrobial agents that inhibit infections. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based polymers are water- swellable hydrophilic cross-linked polymers with high elas- ticity (Fig. 2g). Their hydrophilic and nonionic characteristics make them highly biocompatible and relatively resistant to protein adsorption;96 thus, they are suitable for use in medical products, such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. The copolymerization of biocompatible polyesters and PEG forms hydrogel systems. By appropriately adjusting the lengths of the hydrophobic polyester and PEG blocks, a gel system with ther- mally responsive properties can be obtained, and its thermally responsive properties can be improved. Poly((lactic acid)-co- (glycolic acid)) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA–PEG–PLGA) have the features of biocompatibility, thermal sensitivity and non-toxicity. The temperature sensitivity of the copolymer was controlled by hydrophobic (PLGA) and hydrophilic (PEG) groups in the polymer. Chen et al. prepared exible synthetic hydrogel sealants using PEG. This study showed that PEG-based hydrogels have good biocompatibility and safety.97 The eﬀec- tiveness and convenience of using PEG-based hydrogels for wound closure and bleeding control in animal studies are discussed. Mechanism of thermosensitive hydrogels Thermosensitive hydrogels are water-soluble polymer systems mainly composed of a macromolecular backbone with hydro- philic and hydrophobic groups. They can change hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties and the size and volume of the gel network with a change in ambient temperature and undergo sol–gel or gel–sol phase transition.98 At the molecular level, the © 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Nanoscale Adv.,2023, 5,6017–6037 | 6019 Review Nanoscale Advances View Article Online temperature sensitivity of thermosensitive hydrogels is due to hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic groups and water molecules and hydrophobic interactions between hydrophobic groups in the structure.99 With a change in temperature, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions of the hydrogel are aﬀected, leading to a change in the internal network structure and overall volume of the gel. Thermosensitive hydrogels are classied as thermal shrinkage- and thermal expansion-type thermosensitive hydro- gels according to their swelling mechanism.100 A heat- shrinkable thermosensitive hydrogel is dened as being in a state of contraction when the temperature is higher than the phase transition temperature, and expansion when the temperature is lower than the phase transition temperature. The opposite was observed for the thermally expanding ther- mosensitive hydrogel: it shrank at temperatures below the phase transition temperature and expanded at temperatures above the phase transition temperature. The corresponding critical temperature is called Volume Phase Transition Temperature (VPTT). These features are key to applications in drug delivery, cell culture, tissue engineering, protein delivery, gene therapy, wound healing etc.36 The LCST represents the low critical solution temperature during phase separation. 101 When the temperature is lower than the LCST, the molecular chain is mainly formed by hydrogen bonding between the hydrophilic group and the water molecule. The molecular chain stretches and opens, allowing the gel to fully absorb water and swell into a liquid shape. When heated above the LCST, intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions were destroyed, and hydrophobic interactions became dominant (Fig. 3a). At this time, the molecular chain contracted, and the gel was dehydrated and contracted. Around the upper critical solu- tion temperature (UCST), thermally responsive polymers undergo phase transitions. When the environment is below the UCST, the material does not dissolve. When heated above the UCST, the material dissolves (Fig. 3b). The swelling and contraction of the thermosensitive hydrogel are shown in Fig. 3c. Various types of thermosensitive hydrogel dressings Thermosensitive hydrogels are of great interest in the biomed- ical eld owing to their biodegradability, non-toxicity, inherent biocompatibility, wide availability, and embracing function- ality. The excellent temperature sensitivity and injection char- acteristics of thermosensitive hydrogels make them suitable for drug, cell, protein, or factor delivery,102–104 and they can be used to ll any irregular wound site,105 showing their characteristics and advantages for wound healing (Fig. 4). A summary of the applications, name of dressing composition, main features and other relevant information about thermosensitive hydrogel dressings is presented in Table 1. Antibacterial dressing Infection is a common complication of wounds, and its prevention is very important in wound repair. If the wound is infected, it will cause wound suppuration, prolong healing time, and even cause sepsis in severe cases, endangering life and health. Therefore, important requirements have been proposed for the antibacterial properties of wound dressings. Hydrogels with antibacterial activity, such as chitosan, contain antibacterial structures in their natural polymers and related derivatives. Ma et al. developed a novel in situ injectable hydroxypropyl chitin/TA/ferric ion (HPCH/TA/Fe) composite hydrogel.106 The incorporation of TA provided hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces between the TA and HPCH, which improved the mechanical strength of the HPCH hydro- gel. When the temperature is below the temperature of gelation (Tgel), the pre-cooled hydrogel precursor solution can be injec- ted into an irregular wound area and the solution rapidly gels at a physiological temperature. Also, the TA in hydrogels can be used as a crosslinker to improve the mechanical properties of hydrogels. In addition, it can be used as an antibacterial agent and is released continuously for up to seven days in acidic environments (Fig. 5a). Similarly, a hybrid hydrogel was Fig. 3 (a) The LCST-type formulation undergoes sol–gel transition with an increase in temperature.

The optimal formula included a 7% CS PPP micellar solution, exhibiting excellent liquidity and allowing optional application as a spray. The formed hydrogels showed tight adherence to the human skin, rapidly ceased bleeding, eﬀectively inhibited bacterial growth (Fig. 5b), and accelerated wound healing. Moreover, this simple hybrid hydrogel can be easily prepared and applied and has potential applicability in clinical wound treatment. Although hydrogel dressings can protect wounds from infection, they can be deformed by external forces, leading to infection. Thermosensitive hydrogel materials oﬀer a solu- tion to this problem; when the external environment changes, a phase transition occurs, which can quickly ll irregular wound areas and form gels under physiological conditions. Therefore, the use of thermosensitive hydrogels with antibacterial prop- erties for wound healing is highly desirable. Drug delivery Drugs play an important role in wound healing.147 Thermo- sensitive hydrogels have been used as drug carriers in the biomedical eld148–150 because of their injectability, ability to carry therapeutic agents for specic site delivery, prolonged Table 1 (Contd. ) Application Name of dressing Composition Main features Tsol–gel Ref.

Thermosensitive hydrogels can be used as drug carriers for local delivery and activate immune cells to promote wound healing. Heparin was coupled to poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) by developing an injectable in situ gel-forming polymer, and ibuprofen was encapsulated in the hydrogel.110 Hep–PNIPAM hydrogel had the highest swelling ratio and formed a hydrogel at 37 °C. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inammatory drug (NSAID) that is critical during the inammatory phase of heal- ing; however, it has a short half-life. Ibuprofen was encapsu- lated in the Hep–PNIPAM hydrogel by simple mixing and was formulated as an injectable solution. When the temperature was up to 37 °C, ibuprofen was released mainly by diﬀusion and was followed by hydrogel erosion. The ibuprofen release proles from the Hep–PNIPAM hydrogels are shown in Fig. 6a. The drug release curve revealed that the cumulative release was ∼70% and sustained ibuprofen release lasted for 1 week. Hydrogels create a moist environment on wounds, absorb exudates, and prevent dehydration. In combination with anti-pain drugs, they create an environment conducive to wound healing. Curcumin is one of the most potent natural antioxidants.151 Therefore, a thermosensitive gra copolymer of alginate pNI- PAM was synthesized for curcumin in the wound area.111 The polymer showed excellent thermal gelation properties at diﬀerent pH and concentration ranges, with good rheological properties. These characteristics allowed the formulation of an injectable dressing of curcumin with easy application to all types of wounds and lesions with diﬀerent surface geometries and depths. The optimum copolymer showing the gelling temperature at 35 °C, Alg-g-NIPAM(15) was selected for curcu- min loading. The cumulative release percentage of curcumin from Cur-F is presented in Fig. 6b. The formulation showed a triphasic release pattern at PBS pH 7.4, the curcumin release time increased up to 72 h (92.4% ± 5.4). This prolonged release of curcumin can be due to both a lag time being needed for the system to absorb water and a slow process of polymer erosion leading to the release of curcumin molecules encapsulated within more internal parts of the gel. This extended release is benecial for wound healing. Zhao et al. designed a 37 °C-sensitive hydrogels system using poloxamer 407 as a thermosensitive matrix with chitosan and hyaluronic acid, loaded with dihydromyricetin as a wound dressing.113 They took the gelation time and temperature as response values to optimize the proportion of various materials and obtained the formula that can be used as a gel at the temperature closest to the human body. Then, 10% dihy- dromyricetin was added to the gel for structural characteriza- tion. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the dihydromyricetin hydrogels performed better in terms of homogeneous distribution and structural quantity, enabling dihydromyricetin to enter cells and be released. The hydrogel was able to release myricetin dihydrate at 37 °C for up to 100 h, and the cumulative release rate was 86% according to the in vitro drug release test (Fig. 6c); therefore, it can reduce the frequency of repeated dressing changes in clinical practice. Thermosensitive hydrogels for drug delivery were developed by mixing thermosensitive polymers with other natural poly- mers. The critical gelation transition temperature is close to the physiological environmental temperature of the human body Fig. 5 (a) Bacterial colonies of E. coli and S. aureus after coculture with PBS, HPCH, HPCH/Fe (day 1), and HPCH/TA/Fe (days 1, 4, 7) hydrogels, respectively.

As a physically cross-linked temperature-sensitive hydrogel, there are no organic solvents or nontoxic initiators in the preparation and use processes, which makes it safer. Therefore, thermosensitive hydrogel materials are ideal for sustained drug-release systems. Cell/factor/protein carrier Dressings loaded with cells, factors, or proteins can accelerate wound healing. Hydrogels have a high water content and a structure similar to that of the natural extracellular matrix, which can be used as a carrier for cell delivery.152 In addition, thermosensitive hydrogels can eﬀectively control and continu- ously release proteins, avoiding adverse side eﬀects that may occur due to the instability of proteins and the need for repeated dosing over time.153 The treatment of local wounds with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is widely used as a promising approach to enhance tissue regeneration. 154–156 A new strategy was proposed in which three- dimensional mesenchymal stem cell (3D MSC) spheroids were combined with an injectable thermosensitive chitosan/collagen/ b-glycerol phosphate (b-GP) hydrogel to accelerate chronic wound healing by enhanced vascularization and paracrine eﬀects. 123 (Fig. 7a). Chitosan/collagen/b-GP solution mixed with 3D MSC spheroids was rapidly turned into a gel at body temperature by physical cross-linking, completely covering the wound. The hydrogel provided an environment conducive to the attachment and proliferation of encapsulated MSCs, particularly by acceler- ating the proliferation and paracrine factor secretion of 3D MSC spheroids, thereby promoting wound healing in mice. Lin et al. developed a polyurethane (PU)/hydrogel, a copol- ymer of the thermosensitive N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) and acrylic acid (Aac).125 NIPAAm was simultaneously copoly- merized with Aac, the hydrogel was graed onto porous PU using-ray irradiation, and broblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) was loaded into the composite. The release of FGF-2 can last for at least 7 days (Fig. 7b), because the interactions between the negative charge of Aac (with COO–) and the positive charge of FGF-2 maintain its slow release. This prevents the fast release of FGF-2 due to its high diﬀusibility. Therefore, the temperature- sensitive feature of the hydrogel can be used to control the release of the active ingredient, as well as to absorb the wound exudate and to keep the wound in a moist environment. The PU/ hydrogel composite strips are easier to use than commercial wound dressings due to their thermal sensitivity properties. The process of wound healing is closely related to the dynamic balance of extracellular matrix (ECM). 157 Matrix metal- loproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in regulating the metabolic balance between ECM synthesis and degradation. 158 A hybrid thermosensitive hydrogel dressing was developed for the localized and prolonged delivery of siMMP-9. 126 The thermo- sensitive hydrogel consisted of Pluronic F-127 (PF) and methyl- cellulose (MC), and the GT/siMMP9 complex was loaded onto the hydrogel. The siMMP-9 was rst complexed with GT via electro- static interaction, and then GT/siMMP-9 was encapsulated in PM hydrogel. The thermosensitive hybrid hydrogel could be formed in situ and then form a strong interface with arbitrarily shaped wounds. In addition, the hybrid hydrogel released GT/siMMP9 continuously through temperature-sensitive control for up to seven days, resulting in signicant MMP-9 silencing (Fig. 7c) and accelerated wound healing in diabetic rats. Traditional thermal gels oen exhibit poor physical proper- ties and low binding aﬃnities for cells or proteins, which limit their practical application. Modied thermosensitive hydrogels can be used as carriers of cells or proteins for wound healing owing to their good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and physical stability. Tissue-adhesive hydrogels Although various types of hydrogel dressings have been used in so tissue regeneration, the high water content of the hydrogel polymer network makes them brittle.159 Hydrogels with superior mechanical properties meet the requirements for tissue regen- eration. Therefore, it is necessary to develop adhesive, elastic, and biodegradable hydrogels. Many researchers have developed synthetic hydrogels that mimic biological tissues. However, the damaged covalent bonds in the hydrogel network cannot be easily recombined when the hydrogels are subjected to cyclic loading or deformation,160–162 and exhibit poor adhesion or self- healing abilities. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymer materials can be used in composite hydrogel wound dressings for rapid tissue adhesion and closure.

The higher number of PCLA block polymer in the conjugates creates a hydrophobic balance to maintain the gel state at body temperature (37 °C). In addition, the existence of functional groups in the Gel–PCLA conjugate can make hydrogen bonding that contributes to the improvement of gel strength. The PCLA copolymers showed temperature-sensitivity and the freely owing PCLA copolymer sols at low temperature were trans- formed into stable hydrogels. Therefore, the in situ formation of IGs can be considered as promising wound dressing materials for the treatment of multiple wounds. An injectable multifunctional hydrogel of a mussel-inspired adhesive and self-healing hydrogel was shown to be suitable as a wound-healing dressing for treating deep wounds.138 This was inspired by ocean mussels, which can use catechol groups and metal ions to attach to the surfaces of wet objects in uid environments and self-heal aer taking damage. 163,164 Using a thermally sensitive material as the hydrogel base, the sol–gel transformation can be controlled according to temperature changes in the human body. Methacrylate (C18) was added to improve the mechanical properties. Furthermore, chelation was conducted between dopamine acrylate with a catechol group and iron ions (Fe 3+) in a ferric chloride solution. A sol–gel transition can be quickly achieved through the thermosensitive properties and action of catechol–iron ions, which produces adhesion and self-healing eﬀects. The bioadhesion experi- mental setup is shown in Fig. 8b. The results showed that as the DAA–Fe 3+ ratio increased, the adhesiveness of the hydrogel increased (Fig. 8c). The actual adhesion properties of the gel are presented, including its successful adhesion to a glove, poly- styrene plate, and glass slide (Fig. 8d). The hydrogel covered the wound while absorbing exudate and blood from the wound, creating a protective barrier against bacterial infection. However, owing to the high water content of the hydrogel, the wet wound environment, and continuous exudation, it is diﬃcult for hydrogel dressings to adhere to the wound tissue. Tissue adhesion in healing dressings is critical for deep-tissue wounds. Thus, injectable hydrogels that keep a wound moist while maintaining high adhesion can be used for further applications in wound healing. Wound contraction Wound closure is a key step in surgery and trauma handling and it allows for the biological event of healing through the joining of wound edges.165 The hydrogels' thermoresponsive self-contraction ability assists wound closure in the early stages of wound healing. When the hydrogel adheres tightly to the surrounding skin, the contraction of the hydrogel triggers the wound closure. Therefore, a kind of novel multifunctional wound dressing that has biochemical self-contraction ability while promoting wound closure is desired for wound-healing application. A recent study reported a two-pronged strategy of biome- chanically active and biochemically functional hydrogel wound dressing.142 They used a series of biomechanically active injectable self-healing hydrogels based on quaternized chitosan (QCS), polydopamine-coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO– PDA), and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) as multi- functional wound dressings. QCS, rGO–PDA, and NIPAm monomers were fully mixed, and the QCS/rGO–PDA/PNIPAm hydrogels were synthesized with the addition of initiator APS/ TEMED and cross-linker BIS via free radical polymerization. The researchers applied a hydrogel with outstanding tissue adhesion properties on the wound. Subsequently, because of the thermoresponsive self-contraction ability, when the temperature increased above 33 °C (LCST of PNIPAm), the volume of the hydrogel decreased rapidly, which was benecial for the initial stage of wound healing through the contraction force-assisted closure of cracked wounds (Fig. 9a). Hydrogels adhere strongly to the skin and assist wound closure by actively contracting wounds through self-contraction. Yu et al.143 developed a novel supramolecular poly(N-iso- propylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel dressing composed of qua- ternized chitosan-gra-cyclodextrin, adenine, and polypyrrole nanotubes via host–guest interactions and hydrogen bonds. Adenine was introduced into the PNIPAm polymer backbone via Fig. 8 (a) The adhesive strength of PCLA and IG hydrogels was esti- mated through a universal testing machine.

The researchers added QCS for its biocompatibility, high solubility, inherent antibacterial activities, and synergistic tissue adhe- sion. At the same time, PPY NTs were introduced to further impart antioxidant properties, antibacterial capacity, and conductivity to the hydrogels. Physical crosslinking, including host–guest interactions and hydrogel bonding, was employed to fabricate the multifunctional hydrogels in this work (Fig. 9b). The hydrogel demonstrated a thermal contraction of 47% of the remaining area aer 2 h at 7 °C and tissue adhesion of 5.74 kPa, which are essential for noninvasive wound closure. PNIPAm– AA/QCS–CD/PPY hydrogels adhere strongly to the skin and assist wound closure by actively contracting wounds through self-contraction to promote wound closure and wound healing. Thermosensitive hydrogel for diverse wounds Skin wound healing results from a series of complex biological and molecular events, including angiogenesis, cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, diﬀerentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. 166 Several factors aﬀect the process and duration of wound healing. Appropriate wound dressings play important roles in promoting wound healing. Thermo- sensitive hydrogels are characterized by their excellent temperature sensitivity and injection characteristics and can be used to ll irregular wound sites. Simultaneously, they can be loaded with bioactive molecules or drugs to make functional complementation dressings. Thermosensitive hydrogels can be used to treat chronic diabetic, burn, and surgical wounds (Fig. 10). A summary of thermosensitive hydrogel dressings for diverse wounds is presented in Table 2. Chronic diabetic wounds Diabetes is a common clinical disease. According to the nd- ings of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approxi- mately 537 million adults worldwide will be living with diabetes in 2021.167 Diabetic wounds are stimulated by high blood glucose, oen accompanied by a persistent inammatory response, oxidative stress injury, angiogenesis disorders and a high risk of bacterial infection, resulting in skin ulcer, tissue necrosis, wound infection and other problems, and its treat- ment is complex and expensive, which is a worldwide problem.168 Therefore, in addition to the original properties of hydrogel dressings, an ideal diabetic wound hydrogel should have anti-inammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, pro- angiogenic, and hypoglycemic eﬀects. In chronic wounds, repeated tissue damage causes an excessive release of cytokines, continuously stimulating and recruiting immune cells to the injured site, resulting in an overactive inammatory response and the prevention of wound healing. 169,170 Chen et al. developed a biodegradable, multi- functional crosslinker and an N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM)- based, thermosensitive hydrogel to carry BMSCs to treat dia- betic ulcers.171 The crosslinker contained an RGD-like motif thatFig. 10 Thermosensitive hydrogel for diverse wounds.

The polymer was in the sol state at room temperature; aer immersion in a 33 °C water bath, it experienced sol–gel tran- sition in minutes. Researchers seeded BMSCs on the surface of hydrogels, which can adhere to and proliferate on the hydrogel. The results showed that the expression of pro-inammatory M1- type macrophages in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group, and the expression of M2-type macrophages was higher (Fig. 11a and b). A hydrogel loaded with BMSCs can promote the adhesion and diﬀerentiation of BMSC, which is conducive to wound healing and improves the inammatory microenvironment of diabetic wounds. In another study, a thermosensitive hydrogel dressing loaded with Lactobacillus lactis was prepared. 172 The hydrogel material produced and delivered lactic acid in situ, both in vitro and in vivo, promoted the transformation of macrophages from M1 to M2, and accelerated the healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Neovascularization plays a crucial role in wound healing. However, microvascular formation in the wounds of patients with diabetic feet is impaired, resulting in wounds being unable to obtain suﬃcient oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors.171 In a recent study, rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were loaded into Pluronic F127 (PF127) to prepare a novel thermosensitive hydrogel material, and the eﬀect of PF127 hydrogel-loaded ADSCs on angiogenesis in large diabetic skin wounds was observed.173 Immunohistochemistry, micro- vessel counting, wound area measurement, and VEGF measurement showed that the experimental group had more new capillaries and faster wound healing than the control group (P < 0.05). PF127 hydrogel-loaded ADSCs accelerated wound healing by promoting the formation of new capillaries in dia- betic rat wounds. High-reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations are one of the reasons for chronic wound healing caused by diabetes.174 Dressings that scavenge ROS can eﬀectively reduce the concentration of reactive oxygen species in a wound, improve its inammatory microenvironment, and promote wound heal- ing.175 Xu et al. prepared a thermosensitive poly(D,L-lactide)– poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA–PEG–PDLLA) hydrogel (PLEL)-based wound dressing in which PBNPs were homogeneously incorporated. The system at 37 °C was in a gel state. This injectable PBNPs@PLEL system can adapt to various wound types and form a gel within 30 s in vivo. 176 Once placed, PBNPs@PLEL exhibited sustained and controlled release behavior. PBNPs were slowly released and exerted sustained antioxidant activity aer the injection of PBNPs@PLEL into the wound site (Fig. 12a). Zhu et al. synthesized poly(polyethylene glycol citrate-n-isopropyl acrylamide) (PPCN) via sequential polycondensation and free radical polymerization reactions.177 PPCN has intrinsic antioxidant properties due to the diol-citrate esters in its backbone that may reduce oxidative stress at the wound aer gelatinization above the LCST (37 °C). A thermo- sensitive hydrogel material with sustained release of SDF-1 was prepared, which not only played an antioxidant role but also accelerated the regeneration of wound granulation tissue and promoted rapid wound healing (Fig. 12b). SDF-1 was introduced to promote angiogenesis and cell migration. When the temperature dropped to 37 °C, there was sustained release of SDF-1 from the hydrogel. The application of topical insulin has also been shown to be of great help in improving wound healing.178,179 However, due to molecular instability and sustained delivery eﬀects, local insulin administration still faces great challenges.180 A previous study reported that a thermosensitive hydrogel combined with insulin injection improved skin wound healing in diabetic mice. 181 Poloxamer 407 is widely employed for drug delivery because it is reported to be nontoxic and can form gels at 25 °C. Poloxamer 407 and insulin were injected into the wounds of diabetic mice and compared with those of other controls to measure the rate of wound healing at 28 days intervals Fig. 12 (a) Schematic overview of the use of PBNPs@PLEL for the enhancement of diabetic wound healing due to its ability to scavenge ROS and to promote the functional recovery of mitochondria.

The results showed that the expression of both transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b1) and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) increased signicantly in the early stages of diabetic wounds aer insulin injection (Fig. 13b). Poloxamer + insulin-treated mice displayed enhanced wound healing. The emergence of thermosensitive hydrogels has provided a new approach to the management of diabetic wounds. Ther- mosensitive hydrogels can be attached to diﬀerent materials to adapt to diﬀerent types of wounds. The sustained release of drugs or bioactive molecules from thermosensitive hydrogels is important for promoting chronic wound healing. The genera- tion of chronic diabetic wounds is a multifaceted and multi- linked process. Based on the diﬀerent stages of diabetic wound healing, more targeted and individualized thermosensitive hydrogel dressings with additional functions can be designed. Burn wounds Burns are a common type of injury in humans and are generally caused by exposure to hot liquids, vapors, or gases.182,183 Diﬀerent classications were performed according to the depth of the burn wounds.184 Burn wound dressings need to be replaced frequently, which aggravates pain and discomfort.185 Traditional burn wound dressings easily adhere to the wound aer absorbing the wound exudate. When dressings are removed, the wound is injured again, and new tissue tears easily.186,187 Therefore, an ideal dressing for the treatment of burn wounds should provide a local moist wound-healing environment for the body, adapt to diﬀerent wound shapes, and improve the therapeutic eﬀect of wound-healing drugs. Human broblast growth factor 2 (hFGF2) can promote broblast proliferation, migration, and diﬀerentiation; the local administration of hFGF2 in burn wounds can promote granu- lation tissue regeneration and angiogenesis,188 but it can easily lose its biological activity.189 In order to provide a supporting environment for hFGF2 and controls its release in a stable manner. Zhang et al. encapsulated camelina lipid droplet (CLD)-hFGF2 in thermosensitive hydrogels.190 The poloxamer composite hydrogels were synthesized from P188 and P407. The shell of these spherical micelles consists of a polyoxyethylene nucleus and an expanded polyoxyethylene chain. With the increase in temperature, the hydrophobic polyoxyethylene segment in the hydrogel loses water and polymerizes into micelles. As the temperature continues to rise, the formation arrangement of micelles forms hydrogels. They can quickly gel on the surface of burn wounds, reduce drug ow loss and improve the drug utilization rate. The prepared CLD-hFGF2 hydrogel can gel with changes in temperature (Fig. 14a) and undergo in vitro degradation. CLD-hFGF2 exhibited an initial burst release from the hydrogels aer 12 h (approximately 30%), followed by a slow release over 72 h (almost 60%) aer drug delivery, CLD-hFGF2 promoted the proliferation and migration of NIH3T3 cells. In vivo experiments also showed that the CLD- hFGF2 hydrogel accelerated extracellular matrix (ECM) regen- eration and angiogenesis, signicantly improved burn wound Fig. 14 (a) The thermosensitive property of CLD-hFGF2 hydrogels and in vitro degradability.

In another study, a heat-responsive wound dressing was synthe- sized using chitosan and poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEAAm).191 It has temperature-dependent and swelling properties and is easy to separate at lower temperatures. This ability to modulate adhesion will facilitate a non-traumatic manner of removal from wound sites, especially burn wounds. Antimicrobial activity studies have demonstrated the ability of the dressing to control the release of incorporated antibiotics and enhance wound healing by inhibiting bacterial growth. Burn wounds vary in depth and area and their shapes are usually irregular. Moreover, owing to the complexity and severity of burn wounds, traditional dressings cannot meet the requirements for burn wound healing. In a recent study, the thermosensitive hydrogel Pluronic F127 (PF127) was used for the rst time as a sprayer for skin wound healing (Fig. 14b).192 A coordination complex of zinc and metformin (ZnMet) was loaded onto PF127. The polymer did not change the properties of PF127, and the porous structure allowed the uniform release of the drug in the tissue. Sprayable ZnMet-PF127 evenly lled irregular skin defects in the liquid state. Aer ZnMet-PF127 was sprayed on the skin wound, it immediately changed from liquid to semi-solid due to its thermosensitive characteristics, isolating the skin wound from the external environment and reducing wound infection. It can also provide a wet environ- ment for burn wounds as well as anti-inammatory and anti- bacterial eﬀects to promote wound healing. Thermosensitive hydrogels can quickly gel at body temper- ature. When dressings are changed, a gel-solution thermo- sensitive conversion can be used to facilitate fading and reduce unnecessary pain. At the same time, it is not limited by the shape and depth of the wound and can completely cover the wound due to its injectable features. In addition, thermo- sensitive hydrogels loaded with drugs or bioactive substances exhibit good biocompatibility, which can promote burn wound healing and reduce the frequency of dressing changes through the sustained release of drugs or factors. These properties make thermosensitive hydrogels promising materials for a wide range of applications in burn wounds. Surgical wounds Traditional closure methods for surgical wounds include the use of sutures or staples, which are usually invasive and may cause unsatisfactory tissue integration, trauma, and leakage of content.193–196 Thermosensitive hydrogels exhibit good biocom- patibility, tissue adhesion, and temperature-sensitivity. They can avoid secondary injury to the surgical incision, reduce the frequency of dressing changes, and promote wound healing, providing a new choice for surgical wound healing. Recently, a novel bio-inspired injectable wound dressing with superior mechanical properties, adhesion strength, temperature adhe- sion, and self-healing ability was developed.197 Ferric ions were added to a multifunctional adhesive composed of sodium alginate (SA), gelatin (GT) and protocatechualdehyde for suture- less post-wound closure. The thermal-response phase transition of GT, the Schiﬀ base bond, and the catechol–Fe-coordinate bond in the network give the hydrogel injectable, shape- adaptable, and strong adhesion and self-healing abilities at body temperature. Rat skin incisions were created, and then sutures, biomedical glue, and adhesive hydrogel were used to heal the incision; one without treatment was set as the control group. Compared with the other control groups, the mechanical strength of the skin tissue treated with the hydrogel group was stronger, the incision was smoother, and the incision closure eﬀect was better than that of the other groups (Fig. 15a). This is primarily because the temperature-dependent adhesion of the hydrogel makes the sealant easy to operate. The hydrogel can separate fault-tolerant adhesion from bad adhesion on the instrument by sensing the local temperature. In addition, its good self-healing ability allows the reopened incision to be closed repeatedly. Good adhesive strength and injection performance can eﬀectively close the incision and promote healing. This multi- functional hydrogel may contribute to the healing of surgical incisions, and the fast and eﬀective closure of surgical wounds is critical. If not treated promptly, injuries can rapidly escalate Fig. 15 (a) Images of the incisions closed by suturing and the tensile strength of the healed skin tissues on day 21.

Bayat et al. designed a system for temporarily closing open eye lesions that restored the intraocular pressure (IOP) and was easily removed (Fig. 15b).198 Through the reversible and thermal response properties of PNIPAM, its thermal response behavior and mechanical strength were adjusted to form a hydrogel that could ll irreg- ular edges and seal the wound. Their thermal-sensitive behavior allows thermal sealants (TRS) to be easily removed by applying cold water without additional trauma to the surrounding tissue during placement or removal. Hydrogels have the advantages of rapid reversible wound occlusion, shape adaptability, safety, and eﬀectiveness, as well as translational potential as intelli- gent wound sealants, which can be used as intelligent wound dressings for the temporary occlusion of surgical incisions or wounds. Thermosensitive hydrogels can be thermally respon- sive through biodynamic bonding with rapid injectable lling, good adhesive strength, responsive adhesion ability, and easy placement or removal properties, making them promising candidates for surgical incision dressings. Conclusions and further perspectives Wound healing is a complex dynamic biological process. With the development and integration of biomedicine and materials science, the research and development of new hydrogels with high eﬃciency, intelligence, and microenvironmental adapt- ability provide new ideas and opportunities for wound repair. Thermosensitive hydrogels make use of the specicity of poly- mer materials in response to external temperatures so that the polymer undergoes reversible conformational changes under external temperature changes and realizes the transformation process from solution to gel. It is an excellent carrier for loading various bioactive substances or drugs in liquid form and can promote the transdermal absorption of drugs aer being turned into a gel. Simultaneously, good mechanical ability and tissue adhesion of thermosensitive hydrogels, easy removal, and other characteristics are crucial for wound management. A few points should be emphasized when designing new thermosensitive hydrogels for wound healing as follows. (a) The mechanical stiﬀness of the thermosensitive hydrogels formed in situ has a great inuence on their practical application. (b) The selection of the thermosensitive polymer types will aﬀect the biocom- patibility and biodegradability of gel systems. (c) Appropriate temperature-sensitive materials should be selected according to diﬀerent wound types. (d) The duration of gelation time should be controlled reasonably according to the therapeutic needs to avoid the sudden release of drugs, factors, proteins, etc. Although thermosensitive hydrogels have achieved some success in wound treatment as wound-healing dressings, some problems remain. For example, most studies are based on animal and tissue models, which are diﬀerent from those of the human body. Conducting research in a clinic requires further research and testing. In addition, the shortcomings of ther- mosensitive hydrogels include slow temperature response, poor biocompatibility and low mechanical properties, and will aﬀect the expansion in the eld of wound healing application. Therefore, the development of a successful thermosensitive hydrogel for wound healing depends on the development of sophisticated material engineering. The future direction of thermosensitive hydrogels for wound healing is to optimize and improve the characteristics of hydrogels to satisfy the treatment needs, and to prepare smart hydrogels with lower cost and lower toxicity, which is expected to realize personalized and rened treatment of diﬀerent wounds and have broad development potential and clinical application prospects. Therefore, this study can provide a reference for the design and development of smart hydrogel wound dressings.
