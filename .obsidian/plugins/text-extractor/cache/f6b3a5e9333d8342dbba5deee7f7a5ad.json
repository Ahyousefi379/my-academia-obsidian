When single MNMs self-assemble into coordinated swarms, either under external control or triggered by chemical reactions, they oﬀer advantages that individual MNMs cannot achieve. These benefits include intelligent multitasking and adaptability to changes in the surrounding environment. Here, we provide our perspective on the evolution of MNMs, beginning with the development of enzymatic MNMs since the first theoretical model was proposed in 2005. These enzymatic MNMs hold immense promise in biomedicine due to their advantages in biocompatibility and fuel availability. Subsequently, we introduce the design and application of single motors in biomedicine, followed by the control of MNM swarms and their biomedical applications. In the end, we propose viable solutions for advancing the development of MNM swarms and anticipate valuable insights into the creation of more intelligent and controllable MNM swarms for biomedical applications. Introduction First proposed in the 1950s, nanoscale machines have experi- enced remarkable advancements in the field of biomedicine in recent decades. Micro/nanomotors (MNMs) are tiny devices that achieve self-propulsion through converting various types of energy into mechanical force.1–7 The characteristic of self- propulsion has shown significant advantages in targeting,8,9 drug delivery,10–12 diagnostics,13,14 antibacterial,15 and in overcoming biological barriers.16 Scientists have designed and constructed various MNMs for diverse applications in the biomedical area, employing different propulsion mechanisms. These mechanisms include external stimuli like magnetic fields,17,18 electric fields, 19,20 ultrasound21–23 and light, 24,25 as well as internal stimuli like chemical reactions.26,27 Among the myriad of propulsion methods, utilizing enzymes as engines has emerged as a promising choice in the field of biomedical applications, primarily due to their biocompatibility and bioavailability. a Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Baldiri I Reixac 10-12, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.

Mater. Chem. B, 2024, 12, 2711–2719 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024 The fundamental study of MNMs has evolved, shifting from a primary focus on the propulsion of individual MNMs to pairwise interactions and collective interactions. While indivi- dual units may obey simple rules, when assembled into groups in a highly ordered way, they exhibit complex and intriguing swarming behavior.28 In living systems, swarming behavior happens in various phenomena such as self-organization of bacterial colonies, cell migration, bioconvection of microbial suspensions and flocks of fish, ants, and birds. Quorum sensing plays a vital role in collective behaviors, for individuals in a swarm regulate their behaviors based on the density of their neighbors.29 Another common characteristic of swarming behavior is the ability to adapt to dynamically changing environments, which requires energy input. 30 By mimicking these features, in the lab, synthetic collective active matters controlled by diﬀerent energy sources have been exploited. In this perspective, we aim at introducing how the enzymatic MNMs derives from single enzymes to enzyme driven MNMs, and how the synthetic MNMs achieve highly ordered swarms automatically or under external control. In addition, we introduce the state-of-the-artwork on applying MNMs in overcoming biofluids, biological barriers, and achieving theragnostic both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the MNM swarms are gradually applied in multiple areas in biomedical applications. The evolution of enzymatic MNMs Enzymatic catalysis converts chemical energy in situ into mechanical energy and promotes enzyme self-propulsion31 (Fig. 1A). The first demonstration of enhanced urease diﬀusion, indicating substrate dependency, was reported by Sen’s group.32 Subsequently, the same group revealed that enzyme motion could be directed towards areas of high substrate concentration, resembling cell behavior and exhibiting a form of chemotaxis.33 However, the enhanced diﬀusion of single enzymes is controversial regarding the underlying mechan- isms, which is mainly attributed to various physicochemical phenomena, including diﬀusiophoresis,34 conformational Fig. 1 Motion of individual enzymes and enzymes tethered MNMs. (A) Schematics showing the main mechanisms behind the self-propulsion of individual enzymes and enzyme tethered MNMs. (B) The spherical particle with a reaction site.

B, 2024, 12, 2711–2719 | 2713 changes,35 and exothermicity,36 along with the antichemo- taxis. 37 Thus, further investigation is required to address sev- eral concerns, i.e., minimizing the photophysical artifacts of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements and aligning findings with results from complementary techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or dynamic light scattering (DLS).38–41 Considering the self-propulsion capability of enzymes, the concept of enzymatic MNMs was proposed and was initially explored through theoretical demonstrations by Golestanian’s group.42 In those theoretical studies, a spherical particle has a fixed single enzymatic site that releases asymmetrical reaction products, thus propelling a molecular machine (Fig. 1B). In the same year, Heller’s group 43 showed autonomous self-propulsion of conductive carbon fiber decorated with glucose oxidase (GOx) at one end of the fiber and bilirubin oxidase (BOD) at the opposite end. The bioelectrochemical reaction, at the air–liquid interface, promotes the flow of electrons from the anode (GOx) to the cathode (BOD) within the carbon fiber, which is essential for the fiber’s motion. Furthermore, the authors claimed that a linear or spiral trajectory could be controlled by altering the GOx/BOD ratios. Subsequently Feringa’s group 44 experimentally demonstrated the theory of enzymatic nanotubes propelled by asymmetrical reaction products (Fig. 1C). Covalent attachment of glucose oxidase and catalase to carbon nanotubes enables the tandem catalytic conversion of the natural fuel glucose to kinetic energy. Later, Sa´nchez’s group 45 designed rolled-up microtubes propelled by covalently bounded catalase enzyme inside the micromotors’ cavity (Fig. 1C). These hybrid microengines achieved high efficiency and allow the microtubes to move at a very low concentration of fuel. Sen’s group46 experimentally demonstrated enzymatic sphe- rical MNMs (Fig. 1D). They immobilized urease and catalase separately on polystyrene microparticles, showing diﬀusion enhancement in a substrate concentration-dependent manner, like the behavior exhibited by single enzymes. In the same year, Sa´nchez’s group26 reported the first biocompatible Janus nano- bots, emphasizing the significance of asymmetry in enhancing motion and supporting previous theoretical studies done by Golestanian (Fig. 1E). Similarly, Sta¨dler’s team 47 designed Janus silica nanoparticles driven by a harmless tandem reaction invol- ving the glucose oxidase–catalase pair. Subsequently, Sa´nchez’s group 48 revealed that asymmetric distribution of enzymes could also be induced in non-Janus micromotors through the utilization of glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker (Fig. 1E). In a similar line, Wilson’s group 49 encapsulated GOx and catalase within stomato- cytes, which are polymer vesicles with bowl-shape structure. This approach resulted in self-propulsionathighspeed. Some crucial parameters need to be considered when design- ing and constructing these enzymatic MNMs, including the amount, the purity, and asymmetric distributions of enzymes, as well as the presence of electrolytes in the media, and the size and shape of the MNMs 50–54 (Fig. 1E–G). Additionally, some intrinsic features of the enzymes are equally important, i.e., molecular weight of the substrate and products, 39,55 as well as high turnover number 56 and the chemical binding. 57 Overall, these studies collec- tively contributed to the evolving landscape of MNMs research, offering new avenues for exploration in biomedical applications.

B, 2024, 12, 2711–2719 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024 Biomedical applications of MNMs The human body is an extremely complex system with sophisticated barriers that protect it from external threats. To eﬀectively reach the targeted area and exert their therapeutic eﬀects, MNMs must travel through challenging environments and overcome barriers, e.g., mucus, 58,59 blood brain barrier, 60 skin, 61,62 and eye vitreous. 63 Moreover, evaluating therapeutic outcomes in a real body system is more challenging compared to simple in vitro cell models. Stage 1: movement in complex media Using body fluids for travelling is an arduous task, mainly due to the presence of mesh structures and high viscosity. Mesh structures limit the movement of MNMs in a size-dependent manner, requiring the same size range between MNMs and the mesh. Fisher’s group 64 demonstrated that helical nanopropellers with a filament diameter of about 70 nm showed advantage when move through high-viscosity solutions, with comparable velocities to that of larger micropropellers (Fig.2A).Thisismainlybecause these nanopropellers are of the same size range as the gel’s mesh size.Incaseof highviscosity,acousticpropulsionhas been proved to be eﬀective for moving in complex biological fluids such as blood, mucus, or fetal bovine serum. 65 Another possibility is using enzymes for modulating matrix networks, which would allow MNMs to go through it. For instance, Sta¨dler’ s group 66 showed that an extracellular matrix model made of collagen fibers would not be a movement limitation when nanomotors are supplied with collagenase (Fig. 2B). Stage 2: overcoming biological barriers The presence of biological barriers in the body is considerably restricting the possible biomedical applications of nanotech- nology. Nevertheless, huge steps forward have been made in the MNMs field demonstrating how active nanocarriers can overcome them. The principles that prove to be eﬀective for nature are applicable to scientific purposes. Inspired by Heli- cobacter Pylori, magnetic micropropellers with urease were able to penetrate a mucus barrier, showing how externally manipulated micromotors actively and reversibly modify their surroundings 16 (Fig. 2C). The significance of these applications becomes evident when considering local administration and alternative routes that oﬀer less side eﬀects and more eﬃcient treatments. In the context of biological barriers, skin, which is the largest organ, plays a crucial role in safeguarding the entire body against the external environment. The outermost layer of the skin, known as the stratum corneum, eﬀectively diminishes the bioavailability of topical formulations. 67 A couple of recent approaches have used near infrared light for powering nanomotors and crossing mice skin for antifungal therapy 61,62 (Fig. 2D). Moreover, nanomotors have also shown enhancement in biofilm infiltration. 68 Regarding intravitreal delivery, vitreous humor acts as a barrier, impeding the access of substances to the retina. One innovative solution to this limitation involves the use of slippery helical micropropellers powered by magnetic fields. These micropropellers have shown enhanced penetration in the vitreous humor, eﬀectively overcom- ing the barrier and reaching the retina. 63 Stage 3: in vitro drug delivery In the preceding lines, the advantages of active motion in crossing complex media were clearly demonstrated. In this regard, it is crucial to determine the actual eﬀectiveness of drug delivery in the target cells using active motion. Taking advantage of drug loading capacities of MNMs, Doxorubicin was loaded into urease-nanomotors, and its release increased four-fold in the presence of fuel, showing an enhanced anti- cancer eﬀect against HeLa cells.69 It is worth noting that these nanomotors also showed intelligent drug release in a pH- responsive manner when gating the pores.70 As a result, in the presence of fuel, an enhancement in the internalization and intracellular drug release was observed in 2D HeLa cell culture (Fig. 2E, left). New advanced therapies are emerging, and MNMs are successfully keeping abreast of these advancements. Ultrasound nanowires loaded with a Cas9/sgRNA complex were able to overcome physiological barriers for intra-cellular deliv- ery of functional proteins and RNAs, achieving more than 80% GFP gene knockout compared to 30% knockout observed with the passive ones23 (Fig. 2E, right). Concerning cancer treat- ment, MNMs have awakened special interest as a promising strategy. Active drug-loaded urease-nanomotors exhibited enhanced penetration within bladder cancer 3D spheroids. Moreover, incorporating a targeting antibody on their surface augments penetration, leading to tumor growth inhibition 71 (Fig. 2F, left). Heat delivery via incorporated magnetic nano- particles also benefits from the increased tumor penetration. This approach facilitates localized temperature elevation within deep tumor regions, resulting in localized cell death in the tumor core72 (Fig. 2F, right). Stage 4: in vivo therapeutic outcome In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the application of MNMs in in vivo models to assess their potential in living organisms, following the demonstrated eﬀectiveness and safety observed in in vitro models. To the best of our knowledge, in 2017 therapeutic magnesium micromotors for active drug delivery were successfully tested in vivo for the first time.73 In that case, magnesium-micromotors loaded with an antibiotic significantly reduced a gastric bacterial infection in mice model (Fig. 2G, top). Some years later, the same group tested the eﬀectiveness of hybrid micromotors against acute bacterial pneumonia.74 The observed antibacterial eﬀect in an in vivo mice model stemmed primarily from higher speed in lung fluid, uniform deep tissue distribution and enhanced retention time (Fig. 2G, bottom). Icebreaker-inspired Janus nanorods, functionalized with urease and hyaluronidase, demonstrated how the ability to travel through complex media can lead to a beneficial therapeutic outcome in vivo. 75 As can be seen by increased diﬀusion in tumors and the consequent enhancement in chemotherapy delivery (Fig. 2H). In the case of injecting urease-nanomotors into the bladder, they reached deeper bladder tissue areas and were able to remain even after repeated urination.76 It is worth noting that no toxic eﬀects were detected in other organs of the body throughout these Perspective Journal of Materials Chemistry B View Article Online This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024 J. Mater. Chem. B, 2024, 12, 2711–2719 | 2715 studies, providing an initial safety assessment for these products. MNM swarms driven by diﬀerent types of mechanisms When evaluating potential applications, the impact of an individual motor might not lead to desirable therapeutic out- comes. Some groups have progressed towards swarming beha- vior of MNMs. These MNMs function as a coordinated group, aim at a shared goal, exhibit synergistic eﬀects and enhance their overall eﬃciency. As happens at the single motor level, swarms could be configurated through external stimuli, such as magnetic fields, acoustics, light, and electric fields. Magnetic fields have the advantage of high permeability. When exposed to magnetic fields, magnetic swarms show well-controlled collective beha- vior, environmental adaptability and enhanced capabilities. For example, Sitti’s group77 used rotating magnetic fields to induce the dynamic self-assembly of magnetic microparticles into linear chain-type swarms. Attractive and repulsive interactions among microparticles allow well-defined spatial organization. He’s group78 used haematite colloidal particles for liquid, chain, vortex, and ribbon-like four main collective formations, which can flexibly transform from one to another in a confined environment, showing great potential in future biomedicine (Fig. 3A). External electrical field induces and tunes commu- nications among colloids through dipolar interactions. 79 For instance, Janus particles composed of silica and metal hemi- sphere polarize diﬀerently in an electric field, thus leading to self-propulsion of particles.80 When electric-field frequency is low, the particles move and collide randomly and isotropically. As the electric-field frequency increases, particles interact with each other, with their metallic side facing forwards, aligning during binary collisions and organizing into swarms (Fig. 3B). Electric fields oﬀer advantages such as ease of generation and simplified systems compared to magnetic control, making them a generally applicable tool for studying collective beha- vior. Acoustic fields have noncontact characters and biocom- patibility with biological systems. Wang’s group81 for the first time used acoustic fields to trigger the assembly of catalytic Pt– Au nanowire motors and regulate their collective behavior (Fig. 3C). By changing the frequency of acoustic field, He’s group 82 demonstrated the dynamic aggregation of dandelions- like liquid metal colloidal motors. Collective behaviors could be dynamically repeated by combining acoustic field and switching UV light on and off as well. Wang’s group 83 controlled the aggregation of hybrid TiO2-Au microbowl motors at low pressure regions (nodes) in an acoustic pressure gradient. Upon UV light irradiation, the aggregates move away from the node center. Collective behaviors induced by light or chemicals have been intensively studied.88–90 Micro-sized particles like silver chlor- ide (AgCl) and titania–silica Janus particles can be activated under UV light illumination. These photocatalytic reactions cause local chemical gradient and attract nearby passive silica colloids, which assembled into swarms due to self-diffusio- phoretic effects.91,92 Palacci’s group84 developed a phototactic swimmer based on haematite. This photocatalytic material harvests energy from hydrogen peroxide fuel and forms hier- archical superstructures through non-equilibrium pathways (Fig. 3D). Another important effect on light controlled MNMs is self-osmophoresis. Controlled by blue light, phoretic and osmotic effects in living crystals can be switched on and off conveniently.93 This results in the formation of crystallites that dynamically translate and rotate, collided, joined, and split. These light-induced collective behaviors were well studied regarding the mechanisms. However, due to the limited pene- tration of UV or visible light sources, they are not suitable for deep tissue biomedical applications. Chemicals as external stimulus can regulate reversible collective behaviors of MNMs in a way similar to light. Chemically powered motors are surrounded by a cloud of reactants and products that can ‘signal’ their neighbors and thus influence their interactions. Sen’s group85 showed the transition of Ag3PO4 microparticles between ‘exclusion’ and ‘schooling’ by addition or removal of NH3 based on a self-diffusiophoresismechanism (Fig.3E).Wang’s group 94 demonstrated the swarming of gold microparticles when Fig. 3 MNM swarms driven by diﬀerent mechanisms.

Mater. Chem. B, 2024, 12, 2711–2719 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024 adding hydrazine into a hydrogen peroxide solution. The control of the swarms could be tailored by particles surface modification. In addition to these extensively studied MNM swarms, swarming behavior of molecular machines and enzymatic nanomotors have also been reported. Kakugo’s group86 reported DNA-functionalized kinesin-propelled microtubes, which interact with each other using DNA crosslinkers as signal input (Fig. 3F). Such behaviors could be regulated as transla- tional or circular motion by tuning the physical properties of microtubes. Further control could be achieved by photoirradia- tion if azobenzene is introduced into the DNA strands.95 Enzymatic nanomotor swarms were reported for the first time by Sa´nchez’s group87 (Fig. 3G). In the presence of fuel, urease modified mesoporous nanomotor swarms show vortices and unstable fronts, inducing enhanced fluid mixing and convec- tion. However, the underlying mechanism of those enzymatic nanomotor swarms has not been revealed. Enzymatic MNM swarms oﬀer distinct advantages in the field of biomedicine, particularly in terms of their ability to autonomously propel in situ without the need for external control. This autonomy can also prove beneficial when integrating enzyme-based mechan- isms with external control because MNMs reduce the reliance of external input.96 For instance, swarms of magnetic motors present configurable control over their motion. Therefore, incorporating magnetic moieties may improve the controllabil- ity of swarms of enzyme motors in the future. Biomedical applications of MNM swarms The dynamics of MNM swarms, when controlled in a proper way, could be well applied in biomedicine. In in vitro contexts, some research groups have brought MNM swarms into prac- tice. Sa´nchez’s group97 explored enzymatic nanomotor swarms and their role in enhancing delivery toward HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). Taking advantage of urease-powered motion and swarming behavior, a first troop of enzymatic swarms could destroy biological barriers and reduce steric hindrance by vapor nano- bubbles upon optical trigger. Then the delivery eﬃciency of a second troop of nanomotor swarms was 10-fold increase in the presence of fuel compared to that without fuel. Mou’s group98 explored tumor treatment using nanomotors, where synthetic photonic nanorobots could actively navigate in complex envir- onments through their controllable swarming motions. Addi- tionally, via their responsive structural colors, these nanorobots could map local physicochemical conditions on the fly (Fig. 4B). These motile nano sensors can further guide light irradiation for local photothermal therapy in vitro.99 Facilitating the clinical application of synthetic MNM swarms requires eﬃcient platforms for real-time tracking in biofluids and deep tissues.100 Several groups have studied the movement of synthetic MNMs in biofluids. By functionalizing a NIR probe, a swarm of bacteria-like microrobotic flagella was tracked and visualized in the body of a mouse101 (Fig. 4C). In addition, it was found that while the speed of the swarms was lower in vivo than in vitro, the 3D motion could still be achieved. In another work, based on selecting the optimized swarms in specific biofluids, Zhang’s group 102 demonstrated the ex vivo generation of medium-induced swarms and their targeted deliv- eries in a bovine eyeball (Fig. 4D). Another issue to be addressed is precise on-demand control. Gao’s group 103 used photoacous- tic computed tomography for tracking and visualizing the migra- tion of microrobotic systems toward targeted areas in intestines in real time (Fig. 4F). It was seen how cargo-loaded micromotors could be released on-demand upon NIR irradiation. Recently, enzymatic MNMs have also been reported to show swarming behavior, which has been tracked both in vitro and in vivo.Sa´nchez’s group 87 investigated the swarming behavior of enzyme-powered nanomotors in bladders based on both optical microscopy and PET-CT (Fig. 4E). When intravesically instilled in mice bladder in vivo, the nanomotors could homogeneously distribute in the whole cavity. Urease-powered nanobot swarms were taken one step closer toward translational applications as therapeutical tools 104 (Fig. 4G). By combining advanced imaging techniques, the enzymatic nanomotor swarms exhibit enhanced accumulation and penetration in an orthotopic murine model of bladder cancer. Taking full advantage of this motion-enhanced behavior, the nanomotor swarms show localized radiotherapeutic eﬀects at doses significantly below those required to be eﬃcient. Outlook The evolution of MNMs has seen significant progress from fundamental locomotion at micro/nanoscale to their biomedical Fig. 4 Biomedical applications of MNM swarms.

B, 2024, 12, 2711–2719 | 2717 applications in in vivo biomedical contexts. 105 The emergence of MNM swarms has attracted increasing attention, leading to investigations into various modes of manipulation. 84,92,93 Some of these swarms have demonstrated practical applications in vivo and shown clear advantages over single MNMs. 104 Looking ahead here are several suggestions that may help the future development of MNMs. First, despite the great achievements that have been acquired, at least three main points should be considered for clinical applications: simplicity, biodegradability, and reprodu- cibility. Sophisticated designs will have hard times for reaching industry, basically because of the need of complex and expen- sive scalability processes. Another vital factor is that all these products must be approved by regulatory agencies like the FDA and EMA, which is not easy if there is no complete biocompat- ibility or significant advantages compared with current treat- ments. Finally, high degree of reproducibility must be achieved. Now, looking at most of the publications cited in this perspective and the current state of the art in general, they demonstrated that it is indeed feasible to use MNMs in biomedicine. However, most of these designs do not have a real translation. Now is the time to make it doable by utilizing the simplest and the most biocompatible system that is also cost-eﬀective and scalable. Secondly, for enzymatic MNMs, enzymes play vital role in the motion, thus making it crucial to develop and design new enzymes with enhanced properties, where motion can be opti- mized. One key factor in enhancing motion is the high turnover number. Currently, urease and catalase are prominent players in this field. However, these enzymes possess a drawback that hinders their eﬀective application, particularly in biomedicine: substrate or byproduct toxicity. In this context, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to revolutionize the search for the ideal enzyme, thereby improving motion performance. By employing machine learning algorithms and computational models, AI can analyze vast amounts of data and predict enzyme properties with high accuracy. 106,107 Moreover, similar to other enzyme-based therapies, there remains an issue regarding immunogenicity. One possible approach involves anchoring polymers to the surface of the enzymes. 108 Another option is to reduce the immunogenicity of the protein itself through molecular biology techniques. 109 Thirdly, although in some cases the mechanisms of coordi- nated behavior have been clarified, such as the control of magnetic swarms, there remains a lack of research concerning the mechanism of enzymatic MNM swarms. Therefore, funda- mental understanding of interactions among these swarms is desired and encouraged. In addition, achieving better control over collective movement in enzymatic MNM swarms is a critical goal. In this regard, incorporating magnetic moieties and exploring collective chemotaxis could be eﬀective ways to achieve this goal. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts to declare.
