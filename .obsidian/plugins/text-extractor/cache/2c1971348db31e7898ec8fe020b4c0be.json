Introduction Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline materials in which metal ions/clusters and organic linkers are combined into an ordered network of coordination bonds [1–3].

Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Coordination Chemistry Reviews jou r n a l h o m ep ag e: www. el sevi er .com /l ocate / ccr possess large interstitial pores formed from the molecular-level assembly of constituents into multi-dimensionally extending topologies. A plethora of metal clusters and organic linkers can be used for the synthesis of MOFs, enabling facile discovery of new frameworks through the exploration of countless combina- tions of MOF ‘‘building blocks”. Moreover, by performing linker functionalization [4,5], metal/linker exchange [6–8], guest installa- tion [9–13], defect engineering [14,15], etc., it is possible to further control the various properties (i.e. pore aperture size, surface chemistry, catalytic activity, etc.) of these materials. Finally, recent research trends have seen many composite materials consisting of MOFs with other MOFs [16,17], polymers [18–21], zeolites [22,23], graphene oxides [24,25], etc., which further diversiﬁes the chem- istry and lead to synergetic properties in these materials. Such chemical versatility of MOFs has led to their ﬁrm estab- lishment as prominent candidates in numerous research ﬁelds. Given their inherently large porosity [26,27], MOFs have been extensively considered for adsorption-based applications, showing impressive gas storage and separation performances [28–32]. Also, due to the presence of well-dispersed active sites (i.e. functional groups of linkers, open metal sites) in these materials, MOFs have shown potential for heterogeneous catalysis [33–35]. What makes MOFs even more prominent is that their simple coordination chemistry allows for rational design to take place, leading to the synthesis of new MOFs with previously inconceivable properties. Effectiveness of such rational design is demonstrated in more recent research developments, which show the engineering of bio- compatible MOFs for drug delivery [36–38], or discovery of MOFs with electrical conductivity [39–42] that can be used as superca- pacitors or chemiresistive sensors [43–46]. Opportunities are nearly endless for these nanomaterials as it would always be pos- sible to design and construct a MOF that is best-suited for an appli- cation of interest. As many researchers continue with their exploration of the MOF chemistry, there has been a steep growth in the number of exper- imentally synthesized MOFs [47,48], surpassing more than 100,000 entries identiﬁed as MOFs (of which approximately 10% are por- ous) in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) [49]. Concur- rently, expansion of MOF ‘‘materials space” was further expedited by computational methods that made it possible to com- putationally construct and evaluate new, hypothetical MOFs. Given the relatively simple motifs involved in their synthesis, it is possi- ble to assemble MOF building blocks in silico to obtain new, hypo- thetical frameworks while retaining the coordinate covalent chemistry characteristic of MOFs. Such methods enable the evalu- ation of material performance without synthesizing the MOFs of interest. Archetypal research was conducted by Wilmer et al. [50], who devised a bottom-up approach that conserves the coor- dination geometry of building blocks for assembly of new struc- tures, resulting in the conception of approximately 138,000 hypothetical MOFs (hMOFs). Colón et al. [51] introduced the topologically-based crystal constructor (ToBaCCo), which uses var- ious framework topologies as templates for the assembly and acquirement of hypothetical MOFs. These and several other com- putational methods [52,53] for computational MOF discovery have dramatically increased the number of MOFs available for consider- ation, which consequently poses a new challenge: how can the best-performing MOF be efﬁciently identiﬁed from the vast mate- rials space? Such circumstances have led to the wider utilization of molec- ular simulations in the MOF research ﬁeld [54]. Beneﬁtting from their crystallinity, MOFs can be concisely expressed with small unit cells by imposing periodic boundary conditions, allowing facile prediction of framework properties with computational methods. Accurate interaction behavior of guest molecules with the active sites of MOFs can be determined from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gas adsorption isotherms can be obtained from grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Improve- ment in hardware, advancements in new computational methods, and development of accurate force ﬁelds have dramatically reduced the time required for the evaluation of a single MOF to mere hours at most (c.f. several days or weeks required for exper- iment), without any signiﬁcant loss of accuracy. With advanced molecular simulation methods and large data- bases of MOFs at disposal, it is possible to conduct large-scale com- putational screening of MOFs for various applications. For example, high-throughput screening with GCMC simulations has been immensely effective in identifying the top performing materials and exploring theoretical performance limits of MOFs for gas stor- age and separation applications [55–59]. In the ﬁeld of MOF-based catalysis, large-scale structural screening can be coupled with high-throughput DFT calculations for the identiﬁcation of several new MOFs exhibiting favorable catalytic properties [60,61]. Com- putational screening can also involve the consideration of struc- tural modiﬁcations that could be performed on MOFs. Deposition of atomic/molecular catalysts onto MOFs [62,63] can be considered to study the resulting catalytic activities, or linker vacancy defects can be computationally introduced into MOFs [15,64] so that resulting changes in their gas adsorption behavior can be analyzed. Introduction of powerful computational tools have accordingly brought tremendous changes in the research trends for MOFs. Per- formance data of tens of thousands of MOFs can be readily obtained via molecular simulations with reasonable accuracy. MOFs considered for various applications are no longer limited to experimentally synthesized structures, as it is possible to construct close to an inﬁnite number of materials. Such changes, however, have created new complications as well, since accumulation of large simulated data for MOFs would indicate that straightforward interpretation and analysis are no longer viable. Also, even with the best high-performance computing hardware currently avail- able, it becomes inefﬁcient to exhaust all possible combinations and to perform brute force analysis to identify a few selective best performing MOFs. One way to overcome these new aforementioned challenges is to use machine learning [65]. Machine learning (ML) is the ﬁeld of computer science where computer systems are trained to learn from provided data and make predictions or decisions based on their automated analysis. ML has started to take on a major role in scientiﬁc research, where it has been utilized for various ﬁelds ranging from natural language processing [66] and image analysis [67] to drug discovery [68,69] and genomics [70]. Within the ﬁeld of materials science, ML has been used for various applications including the design and optimization of organic semiconductors, metal oxides, conductive 2D materials, etc. [71–75] As for MOFs, ML techniques can be used to reveal hidden trends in the large amounts of data that may not be straightforward, yet crucial in understanding the material performance. Also, from the inﬁnitely large number of conceivable MOFs, ML can effectively identify the structures that would show the best performance for applica- tions of interest. As such, it is important to understand how various ML methods have been applied for MOFs thus far, and anticipate fruitful directions in which ML can be incorporated in the ﬁeld of MOF research. In this review, we offer a concise overview of the various ways in which ML methods have been used in MOF research. We ﬁrst discuss the various descriptors and representations for MOFs that can be adopted to perform ML on these materials. Then, we focus on property predictions made from ML, where the target property can range from gas storage, separation to electrical conductivity and synthesis optimization. We subsequently move to the discus- sion of ML-assisted MOF design, and explore ways in which ML can be used to directly generate MOFs with the best performance. 2 S. Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 Finally, we conclude by sharing our own perspectives on the potential improvements and prospective future directions of ML- based MOF research. For in-depth explanations of ML algorithms that appear in this review, we direct the readers’ attention to excel- lent literatures found elsewhere [76–78]. 2. Descriptors and representations of MOFs for ML In ML, perhaps the most important consideration to be made during preparation is the choice of input and output data that enters and exits the ML infrastructure. One must make sure that there exists meaningful correlation between the input and output data, which the machine would ideally interpret through its learn- ing process. In the case of MOFs, data given as ‘‘descriptors”, ‘‘representations”, or input parameters for different classes of ML, should be sufﬁciently representative of the framework in question so that the framework is uniquely described and target properties can be properly deduced. For example, in predicting the gas storage capacities of MOFs using ML in the high-pressure regime, it would be most reasonable to choose descriptors that offer ample amount of information about the gas adsorption capacities of a framework, such as pore volume, void fraction, and surface area. In this section, we provide a brief overview of the descriptors that have been used for property prediction of MOFs using ML (see Fig. 1). Then, we dis- cuss the structural representation approaches of MOFs for genera- tive ML applications. 2.1. Descriptors for MOFs As MOFs are well-known for their porosity, geometrical descrip- tors that describe their pore environment have been actively uti- lized for ML, especially for the prediction of gas adsorption and storage capacities. These geometrical descriptors include MOF den- sity, pore volume, gravimetric surface area, volumetric surface area, void fraction, etc. which are metrics that macroscopically describe the material as a whole. Other geometrical descriptors include pore limiting diameter, largest cavity diameter, largest ‘‘free” dimeter, dominant pore diameter, and pore size distribution, which effectively considers the pore geometry at the microscopic scale that may greatly vary between different MOFs. It has previ- ously been reported that such geometrical descriptors are highly indicative of the resulting gas storage performances of porous materials (e.g. Chachine’s rule for hydrogen storage [79]), and hence it is sensible to utilize these geometrical descriptors for ML. To prepare the data required in incorporating these geometri- cal descriptors, open source computational tools such as Zeo++ [80,81] and Poreblazer [82] can be used, or alternatively, GCMC simulations of simple, inert gases can be carried out (e.g. He simu- lations for void fraction determination) [83]. These tools can com- pute the required material properties for a given MOF in a matter of seconds/minutes. Unlike other classes of porous materials (e.g. activated carbon, zeolites), MOFs exhibit vastly diverse chemical environments within its pores, which stem from their high chemical modularity. Such chemical diversity is often crucial in understanding the resulting material performance, and hence many chemical descrip- tors that effectively account for differences in the chemical envi- ronment of MOFs have also been developed. One of the simplest chemical descriptors is the atom/building block count, which keeps track of the number of different atoms or building blocks that are present in the structure per unit volume of the MOF. In some cases, atomic properties (e.g. atomic number, electronegativity, electron afﬁnity, ionization energy, etc.) are jointly considered to provide further chemical insight into the atoms and building blocks involved in a MOF. Chemical descriptors can be formulated to con- currently contain geometrical information as well. This is found in some of the property prediction ML works discussed in Section 3, where atomic property (i.e. electronegativity, polarizability, van der Waals volume) weighted radial distribution functions were Fig. 1. A variety of different input descriptors that can be used for ML of MOFs and other porous materials. Figures for topological descriptors are reproduced with permission from Ref.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 3 deﬁned and used as chemical descriptors [85], ultimately showing impressive prediction performances. In another case, atom counts can be further broken down into different atom types that are found within commonly used force ﬁeld parameters for simula- tions [86]. This efﬁciently accounts for different chemistries that can be observed for a given atom, and hence better distinguishes different chemical environments found in MOFs. Data for these chemical descriptors can be obtained from simple computational scripts that can readily identify and track the number of different chemical moieties found in the unit cells of MOFs. Another widely used class of descriptors (especially for adsorption-based applications) are the energy-based descriptors which directly consider the interaction behavior between various adsorbates and MOFs. As the simple chemical descriptors for the material often fall short in describing the actual interactions that would take place, energy-based descriptors have been developed to provide more information for a given framework. These energy-based descriptors require more computationally expensive calculations to be performed in obtaining the input data compared to the previously discussed chemical descriptors. Nonetheless, such calculations would still be considerably less expensive than the calculations required to fully predict the performance of a given material. In one example, energy histogram of the ‘‘potential energy grid points” within the unit cell was used as a descriptor for ML in predicting the H2 storage performance of MOFs [87].In a handful of other works, interaction of MOFs with hypothetical probes of different kinetic diameters or charge distributions was considered and incorporated as descriptors [88,89]. These hypo- thetical probes aim to map out the potential energy surface of each MOF, thus providing useful information about the resulting adsorption behavior of each framework. Also, when probes of dif- ferent sizes are involved, the pore geometry of MOFs under consid- eration can also be indirectly accounted for. As such, these energy- based descriptors have presented themselves to be advantageous in enhancing the prediction performance of ML models. Akin to the case with simple chemical descriptors, geometrical descriptors can sometimes fall short in providing sufﬁcient infor- mation about the pore environment for the ML model to make accurate performance predictions. In such cases, topological descriptors can be newly used to better consider the complex pore environment of MOFs and other nanoporous materials. Instead of relying on a single deﬁnitive metric that overlook most of the local pore geometry, topological descriptors strive to capture as much detail of the pore structures as possible. Lee et al. [84,90] devel- oped a topological data analysis (TDA) method in which persistent homology is used to describe the pore environment of nanoporous materials. From the resulting ‘‘pore geometry barcodes”, informa- tion about the pore connectivity, morphology, and cavity size of the porous material can be effectively deduced. Hence, ML descrip- tors developed from TDA can comprehensively consider the pore geometry of the materials of interest. In a more recent work by Krishnapriyan and coworkers [91], persistence image approach was also introduced to robustly prepare the results of TDA while preserving as much information as possible. Although such topo- logical descriptors have not yet been extensively used for MOFs, their utility for the prediction of adsorption properties in zeolites have been proven. As such, we believe that these topological descriptors will also be able to signiﬁcantly improve the prediction performance of ML models for MOFs once successfully implemented. 2.2. Representations of MOFs Thus far, our discussion has been limited to discriminative ML models that aim to predict the performance of MOFs for a target application based on the provided input descriptors. This pertains to cases where the high-level descriptors (e.g. void fraction and density) of a large number of actual MOF structures can be calcu- lated rapidly to determine their properties from ML analysis. Another approach for ML is the utilization of abstract material rep- resentation without actual structural information in hand. In other words, a low-level latent space for MOF structures can be con- structed from considering the essential constituents (e.g. metal clusters and organic linkers), and MOFs would then be analyzed without direct structure construction. Such abstract representation approach could be useful especially in cases where a vastly large number of MOFs are generated and considered, once a valid predic- tion model is trained from a subset of MOFs with their structural information available for data preparation. In the case of simple organic molecules, their complete molec- ular representation can be achieved through the consideration of atomic properties and distance or connectivity information between the atoms. This is clearly demonstrated by representation schemes such as the Coulomb matrix (CM) [95], ‘‘bag of bonds” (BoB) [96], simpliﬁed molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) [97,98], and self-referencing embedded strings (SELFIES) [99]. These representation methods allow for the straightforward con- version between ML representation scheme and actual molecular structures. This has led to the rapid development of molecular cheminformatics and its application in various ﬁelds [100,101]. As for the case of crystalline materials, their periodicity must now be accurately accounted for, with translational and rotational invariance. To achieve this, smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) [102], Voronoi tessellation [103,104], crystal graph con- struction [105–107], etc. have been suggested. In the case of MOFs, however, complexity of material representation is far greater than these previous cases. MOFs simultaneously possess the challenges associated with the representation of crystalline materials and complex organic molecules. Therefore, it is important to devise a novel representation scheme that can efﬁciently capture all of the structural information of MOFs for ML to be performed. In the simplest sense, structure of a MOF can be described from three essential information: the choice of metal clusters, organic linkers, and the topology in which these constituents are bonded together. When a simpliﬁed representation that compactly con- tains all of the mentioned information is formulated, it becomes possible to express MOFs in a vectorized format for computational considerations, then ‘‘reverse-map” the representation into an actual MOF structure. Such an approach have proven especially useful in the cases of genetic algorithm (GA)-based MOF screening [92,108,109]. In these works, the ‘‘chromosome” representations of MOFs (see Fig. 2a) that contain all the essential structural informa- tion are used to directly screen the material space of MOFs and obtain the most ideal structure for the target application. Recently, Bucior et al. [93] have introduced systematic identiﬁ- cation schemes for MOFs, namely MOFid and MOFkey (Fig. 2b). Their representations extend upon the previously existing conven- tions for organic molecules such as SMILES and InChIKey to effec- tively account for the organic linkers, then also incorporate MOF- speciﬁc information such as metal cluster type, topology, degree of catenation, etc. In a recent work, Yao et al. [94] devised and uti- lized their own representation method for reticular framework named RFcode (Fig. 2C). RFcode is a tuple that consists of the edges, vertices, and topology of a given framework. In this formulation, the ‘‘edges” do not correspond directly to the full organic linkers of MOFs. Instead, it refers to the linear components of the linkers with two connection points only. The nodal, multi-connecting components of an organic linker would then be deﬁned as an organic vertex. By taking this approach, deconstruction and recon- struction of MOFs can be more smoothly performed. With the appropriate use of these representation schemes for generative ML, latent material space of MOFs could be directly accessed for 4 S. Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 screening, and hence the overall workﬂow of ML-based MOF dis- covery can be dramatically improved. 3. Property prediction of MOFs using machine learning One of the ways in which ML can be used in MOF research is in materials property predictions. The synthesis of a target MOF, acti- vation of the sample, and their experimental analysis can take days or even months depending on a variety of factors, ranging from synthesis condition screening to the availability of precursors. As such, various computational methods (i.e. DFT, GCMC, MD) have been actively utilized in the prediction of material properties. These methods have dramatically reduced the timescale of mate- rial analysis from days/weeks to minutes/hours, and have hence allowed for the large-scale screening of MOFs to take place. Nonetheless, as the computational MOF design methods have resulted in an ever-increasing number of hypothetical structures, brute force computational screening has also become prohibitively expensive even with signiﬁcant amount of available hardware resources. To counter this, ML can be performed to dramatically accelerate the material analysis, where ML models would make predictions by learning from a smaller MOF dataset and extending the knowledge to rest of the materials in the MOF search space. Core essence of this approach is that the chosen descriptors of MOFs would be much cheaper to compute than the direct consid- eration of the output properties [54]. As such, time required for the analysis of each material can be reduced further down from hours to mere seconds, which now allows for the consideration of a much vast MOF material space. In constructing the ML models for property prediction, it is important to consider how to choose and prepare the input and output data for learning. Note that majority of the studies make use of geometrical and chemical descriptors as well as the energy-based descriptors as inputs, which can be computed cheaply using the available computational tools (see Section 2). As for the output data for the properties to be predicted, many researchers have made use of large-scale computational screening results, which provide a sufﬁcient number of data points with rea- sonable accuracy, hence worthy of being used for ML. Moreover, researchers have started to use various data mining techniques to obtain information from numerous existing text publications, which can be an immense help for ML [110,111]. In the following sections, we present several works in which ML have been used Fig. 2. Different representation schemes of MOFs that can potentially be adopted for low-level ML methods. a) shows the representation of MOFs as devised by Chung et al., in which a ‘‘chromosome” for genetic algorithm contains the complete set of information to describe a MOF structure.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 5 for the prediction of MOF properties (i.e. gas storage, separation, mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, synthesis optimiza- tion), with emphasis on the novel strategies that researchers have developed in order to further enhance the efﬁciency of ML workﬂow. 3.1. Gas storage MOFs have initially garnered attention for their signiﬁcant porosity, reaching pore volumes and surface areas that far surpass other pre-existing porous materials. As such, MOFs have shown great potential in the ﬁeld of gas storage, especially as candidate materials for the storage of natural gas or hydrogen for vehicular applications. Most recently, NU-1501-Al was shown to achieve remarkable gas deliverable capacities for both CH4 and H2,of 238 cm3(STP)/cm3 for CH4 and 46.2 g/L for H2 respectively [112]. Nonetheless, further research developments are required for the commercial application of MOFs, as ~ 25% loss in performance is predicted when MOF crystals are processed into real storage sys- tems. To guarantee the competence of adsorbed gas technologies in the market with respect to other gas storage schemes, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has set target deliverable capacities of 263 cm3(STP)/cm3 for CH4 [113], and 50 g/L for H2 [114]. Through the application of ML in studying the gas storage perfor- mances of MOFs, discovery of best-performing materials that can meet or even surpass these target performance metrics can be greatly expedited. Fernandez et al. [115] were the ﬁrst to use ML models for the analysis and prediction of methane storage performance in MOFs. To discover the optimal design parameters of MOFs for CH4 stor- age, large-scale quantitative structure–property relationship anal- ysis was performed on the hypothetical MOFs (hMOFs) constructed by Wilmer et al. GCMC simulations were conducted at 1, 35, and 100 bar and 298 K for each MOF entry, and geometrical descriptors such as dominant pore diameter, void fraction, framework density, volumetric and gravimetric surface area were obtained. Several dif- ferent ML regression techniques (e.g. multilinear regression (MLR), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM)) were used for the statistical analysis, and the geometrical descriptors were taken as inputs in the ML models to predict the CH4 adsorption properties. Results show that the ML regression models were able to predict the CH4 uptake with notable accuracy at higher pres- sures (i.e. at 100 bar, R2 = 0.92 for MLR, Q2 = 0.91 for DT, R2 = 0.94 for SVM, see Fig. 3 for SVM performance). Their two- property SVM models were used to suggest that structures with void fraction of ~ 0.45 and dominant pore diameter greater than 20 Å would result in the maximum CH4 uptake at high pressures. However, prediction performance for these models at 1 bar was relatively poor (R2 = 0.72 with SVM), perhaps indicating the inad- equacy of geometrical descriptors in describing the CH4 adsorption behavior in the lower pressure regime that shows less correlation with the pore volume. Fernandez and coworkers later released a follow-up work [85], where atomic property weighted radial distri- bution function (AP-RDF) was used as an input to include the chemical information of MOFs. In doing so, they noticeably improved the prediction accuracy in the low-pressure regime to R2 = 0.83. These two works demonstrate that at lower pressures, CH4 storage could be better predicted in a model trained with chemical descriptors, and at higher pressures, both chemical and structural descriptors can show reasonable performance. Following this work, efforts were made to consider more diverse features as inputs to further improve the prediction accu- racy of the ML models. In a study by Ohno and Mukae [116], they combined the previously used geometrical descriptors with graph representations of organic linkers as multiple kernels for their Gaussian process (GP) regression model. Their model accuracy was relatively low (R2 = 0.79), most likely due to the limited sam- ple size used in their training set. Nonetheless, incorporation of structural descriptors in their analysis led to successful prediction that linkers made of fused-ring components (i.e. chrysene, pyrene, dibenzocoronene) are beneﬁcial for increasing the CH4 uptake. Another work by Pardakhti et al. [117] also used both geomet- rical and chemical descriptors as inputs for the ML-based predic- tion of CH4 uptake in MOFs at 35 bar, 298 K. In addition to the Fig. 3.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 commonly used geometrical descriptors, they deﬁned and employed various descriptors accounting for the chemical compo- sition: atomic number density, degree of unsaturation, metal/halo- gen to carbon ratio, nitrogen to oxygen ratio, and degree of electronegativity. Multiple regression models (DT, Poisson, SVM, random forest (RF)) were trained using 8% of 130,400 hMOFs as the training set and remaining 92% as the test set. Their results showed that incorporation of both structural and chemical infor- mation for ML can further enhance the prediction accuracy to R2 = 0.98 (see Fig. 4). From their RF model, they also extracted that density, void fraction, surface area, pore diameter, metallic per- centage, and degree of carbon unsaturation were the most impor- tant descriptors in predicting the CH4 uptake. In a study by Wu et al. [118], they further expanded the descriptor set to 37 features by incorporating the Henry coefﬁcient, functional group number density, atomic number density, and the 8-feature data provided in the hMOF database. They trained three different regression models (i.e. SVM, RF, and GBR) with and with- out the additional descriptors as inputs to predict the CH4 uptake at 35 bar, 298 K. They observed that the accuracy of the predictions improved signiﬁcantly with their newly developed descriptors compared to the case without, and achieved an impressive R2 value of 0.96 using GBR. Their feature importance heatmap corroborated that the additional descriptors of Henry coefﬁcient and atom/func- tional group number density were important features in the result- ing ML models. Very recently, Fanourgakis and coworkers [119] devised new descriptors that were effective in predicting the CH4 storage capac- ities at a range of pressures (Fig. 5). In their ML models, they used the average Boltzmann factors calculated for hypothetical probes of different sizes as additional descriptors to the commonly employed geometrical descriptors. The functionality of new, probe-based descriptors is two-fold: (1) size variation of probes would provide more insightful information about the pore geome- try of the MOFs, and (2) calculation of the average Boltzmann fac- tor simultaneously accounts for the potential energy surface of the materials. Their RF models with these descriptors were able to show noticeable improvements in the prediction accuracy, espe- cially in the low-pressure regime (R2 = 0.9 for predictions at 1 bar) where previous ML approaches were shown to be relatively inaccurate. In the case of hydrogen storage, Thornton et al. [120] were the ﬁrst to incorporate ML methods in surveying the deliverable capac- ities for MOFs and other nanoporous materials. In an effort to uncover the theoretical performance limits of H2 storage from more than 850,000 nanoporous materials, they deﬁned and ﬁxed Fig. 4.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 7 net deliverable energy from H2 storage as the objective function. To optimize their workﬂow, they performed ML-assisted screening, where an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) was constructed and trained to predict the adsorption capacities and greatly reduce the number of GCMC simulations required. They proceeded with their ML-assisted screening in an iterative manner, where an initial round of GCMC results are used to train the neural network, which was then used to identify the top-performing candidates. The experimentally obtainable IZA zeolites and hypothetical zeolites with diverse geometries were chosen in their initial set of 1000 materials for GCMC simulations. Next, based on the GCMC simula- tion data, ANN was trained and performance predictions were made for the rest of the materials, and 1000 top-performing mate- rials from the predictions were identiﬁed. As it turns out, predic- tions made by the neural network at this stage were inaccurate, showing inconsistencies between ML predictions and the GCMC simulation results of the identiﬁed candidates. This was expected as the initial data set was only composed of zeolites, whereas the whole material database included other porous materials as well. After two more iterations of GCMC simulations and re-training of ANN, they were able to identify the materials that show the best H2 storage performances (highest deliverable capacity of 40 g/L achieved by a hypothetical MOF), several of which were never pre- viously considered for H2 storage. Their iterative ML approach is shown in Fig. 6. Through additional analysis of the top candidates identiﬁed by the ANN, it was reported that materials with pore sizes of 10 Å and void fractions of 0.5 are ideal for cryogenic H2 storage. This work reiterates how ML can be performed to dramat- ically reduce the computational cost of large-scale screening, and also highlights the importance of using a data set that is represen- tative of all the materials under analysis. In a work by Bucior and coworkers [87], they adopted a new ML approach where potential energy histogram data for H2 within MOFs were newly used as input descriptors. That is, by construct- ing an energy grid for the unit cell of each MOF then putting each grid point into a bin of the respective energy range, they were able to provide a simple yet descriptive parameter that can efﬁciently describe the adsorption chemistry. They primarily used least abso- lute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, which is less prone to overﬁtting than the commonly used MLR. Their model achieved an impressive accuracy of R2 = 0.96, and the training and test results are shown in Fig. 7. The transferability of their model was thoroughly conﬁrmed with different MOF data sets, and their model ultimately identiﬁed 51 promising MOFs from the CSD MOF subset predicted to have volumetric H2 deliver- able capacities higher than 45 g/L. One of the 51 frameworks, MFU- 4 l, was experimentally synthesized and conﬁrmed to show deliv- erable capacity of 36 g/L at 77 K, using 100 bar for storage and 2 bar for delivery conditions. Given that energy grid construction consumes signiﬁcantly less computing time than full GCMC Fig. 6.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 simulations, use of statistical ML methods with energy histograms as descriptors tremendously accelerates the time required for material discovery. Another interesting research was conducted by Anderson et al. [121], where they focused on exploring the theoretical limits of volumetric H2 storage capacities in MOFs. They recognized that multiple MOFs have met the gravimetric H2 storage target, yet fall short in simultaneously satisfying the volumetric target for com- mercial application. Hence, they intended to survey the MOF per- formance limits for volumetric H2 storage by adopting an inverse material design approach where ‘‘alchemical” metal catecholate sites (Fig. 8a) are introduced during the construction of MOFs for analysis. By embedding MOFs with these hypothetical interaction sites with varying interaction strengths (as tuned by different epsi- lon multipliers), they were able to control the H2 adsorption behavior at these sites and study the resulting volumetric storage trends of MOFs without being bound to a speciﬁc surface chem- istry (Fig. 8b). After conducting GCMC simulations of their hypo- thetical metal catecholate MOFs at varying temperatures and pressures, they built and trained an ANN that would predict the H2 adsorption isotherms. To generalize their model as much as possible, their neural network took temperature and pressure as inputs in addition to other normally used parameters. From their results, they concluded that volumetric deliverable H2 capacity of 62 g/L can be an attainable value for MOFs, under 100 bar, 77 K charge and 5 bar, 160 K discharge conditions. Then, from predic- tions made by the trained neural network, they further suggested that the storage pressure could be reduced to 35 bar, while com- promising only 3 g/L of the deliverable capacity (see Fig. 8c). Their work shows signiﬁcance in that a single neural network was able to predict the adsorption at various operating conditions, ulti- mately suggesting a milder operation scheme that could improve safety of the technology in development for commercial application. 3.2. Gas separation MOFs have also proven themselves as promising candidate materials for various gas separation applications. As the frame- works mostly exhibit pore apertures in the order of few nanome- ters or Angstroms, they have shown great potential for molecular sieving (e.g. ZIF-8 for separation of C2/C3, alkane/alkene [122– 124]). With MOFs, however, far more advanced separations can be achieved by discovering a framework with a unique pore envi- ronment or binding site that facilitates strong adsorption of one species while showing relative energetic instability with others. For example, Fe-MOF-74 performs well for hydrocarbon separations, where differences in adsorption behaviors have led to ethylene/ethane selectivity that ranges between 13 and 18, and propylene/propane selectivity between 13 and 15 [125]. MIL-100 displayed promising performance in the challenging sep- aration of N2/CH4, in which a selectivity of 16 is predicted while still guaranteeing signiﬁcant N2 uptake [126].

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 9 Thus far, accurately predicting the adsorptive separation perfor- mances of MOFs required mixed-gas GCMC simulations, which can be quite costly. Alternatively, separation performance can be con- veniently estimated on the basis of Henry coefﬁcient ratio (selec- tivity at inﬁnite dilution), which has been a useful metric in identifying high-performance materials. However, this cannot effectively account for the resulting uptake capacity, which is another crucial factor in the overall separation performance. Mul- ticomponent adsorption can be predicted from single-component calculations using ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), but the theory may fail to properly consider the inter-adsorbate interac- tions. As such, it is worthwhile to develop ML models that can effectually and swiftly predict the separation performances of mil- lions of MOFs from a smaller set of available data. Simon et al. [127] ﬁrst implemented ML algorithms in predict- ing the Xe/Kr separation performance of 670,000 nanoporous materials from the Nanoporous Materials Genome. The utility of MOFs for Xe/Kr separation was previously demonstrated in several high-throughput screening works [59,128,129]. Here, they intended to expand into the entire set of nanoporous materials. Separation conditions were identiﬁed to be for a 2:8Xe/Kr gas mix- ture at 298 K, 1 atm. In addition to the usual geometrical descrip- tors, authors uniquely deﬁned ‘‘surface density” (mass of atoms per accessible surface area) and ‘‘Voronoi energy” (average energy of Xe at the accessible Voronoi nodes) as additional descriptors for their ML model. A diverse set of 15,000 materials were chosen for the training set, and mixed gas GCMC calculations were con- ducted to obtain their Xe/Kr selectivity. RF was adopted as the model of interest, and after sufﬁcient training, the RF model was able to predict the Xe/Kr selectivity with only 1.2 root mean squared error (RMSE) (Fig. 9a). It should be noted that predictions made by the RF model was far more accurate in the lower selectiv- ity region, and the accuracy decreases in the higher selectivity region. This can be attributed for the relative lack of materials in the database that exhibit such high selectivity values. Feature importance analysis of the RF model revealed that Voronoi energy was the most important descriptor in making the predictions, followed by the void fraction (Fig. 9b). Using the trained RF model, the remaining 655,000 nanoporous materials were screened for their Xe/Kr selectivity. 4066 of these materials were identiﬁed to have Xe/Kr selectivities higher than 11 (Fig. 9c). Further GCMC calculations conﬁrmed that the predic- tions made by the RF model was reasonable, with an RMSE of 2.2. Through further reﬁnement of their model by including the GCMC calculations of higher selectivity cases, they additionally identiﬁed 461 materials surpassing the target selectivity (Fig. 9d). From structural analysis of the high-performance materials, they found that highly selective binding sites can be constructed from vastly different chemical fragments, and their morphologies can also be quite diverse. This emphasizes the complexity associated with identifying materials with optimal separation performances, and hence the importance of using high-throughput screening or ML models to efﬁciently evaluate a large database of materials. Recently, it was demonstrated by Gharagheizi and coworkers [130] that ML can be used to identify MOFs for the separation of near-azeotropic chemical mixtures. Currently, there are millions of such mixtures of industrially relevant chemicals whose current separation methods are highly energy and cost-intensive. Hence, MOF-based adsorptive separation could be a promising alternative, and here, performing ML instead of brute force screening to iden- tify MOFs for separation is a sensible approach. For their ML study, ~9600 single component adsorption isotherm data of 460 MOFs for various molecules from azeotropic mixtures were used. In prepar- ing the descriptors for MOFs, they used a set of 25 geometrical and chemical descriptors identiﬁed from feature reduction. Note that the MOF chemical descriptors in this work were uniquely derived from the atom centered-fragments (ACFs) and functional group counts (GCs), which have previously been deﬁned and used in molecular cheminformatics. Given the wide variety of molecules in azeotropic mixtures considered in this work, molecular descrip- tors for the adsorbates were also required. For this purpose, critical temperature, critical pressure, and acentric factor were adopted. In order to predict the adsorption data from GCMC calculations, multiple regression genetic program (MRGP) was used as the ML model of choice. The equation provided by the model was able achieve plausible accuracy, where R2 = 0.82 and RMSE = 1.55.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 However, perhaps due to the simultaneous consideration of both MOF material space and azeotropic mixture space, MRGP model equation showed some limitations. 7% of the predictions made by the MRGP model were prone to showing a relative error larger than 10. In order to amend and further improve their ML model, applicability domain (AD) of the model was considered, which pro- vides a degree of credibility for the predictions made by the MRGP model. The compound ML model now exhibited a 76% probability of generating data with relative error less than 30% (c.f. 59% for MRGP without AD consideration). When making predictions for molecules excluded in the training data, the ML model retained its performance, showing relative error <30% for 73% of the cases. Using their ML model, 4.8 \u0001 1010 near-azeotropic mixture/MOF combinations were analyzed altogether. There were 6.2 \u0001 108 cases where component loading ratio was higher than 1.2, and the model reliability was guaranteed (example case shown in Fig. 10). More than anything, this work demonstrates the great practicality of ML models as the number of cases that can be Fig. 9. a) Simulated Xe/Kr selectivity vs. ML-predicted Xe/Kr selectivity of the training set. b) Feature importance analysis from random forest ML model, revealing Voronoi energy (Ev) to have the highest importance in prediction. c) Simulated Xe/Kr selectivity vs. ML-predicted Xe/Kr selectivity for the promising set of materials with selectivity >11. d) Selectivity distribution for the diverse training set, promising set (selected set), and randomly selected set of materials.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 11 analyzed is dramatically expanded (5–8 order difference) com- pared with brute force screening. In a work by Wu et al. [131], multiple ML models were con- structed to predict the performance of defective UiO-66 structures for ethane/ethylene separation. In their analysis, 425 defective UiO-66 structures were computationally generated where the lin- ker vacancy defect ratios and their spatial distributions were var- ied. In preparing the descriptors for ML, missing-linker ratio and missing-linker short-range order (SRO) were newly introduced to properly account for the defect concentration and distribution in the MOFs. To gauge the performance of MOFs for ethane/ethylene separation, working capacities and ethane/ethylene selectivity were taken as target properties. Uniquely, elastic moduli of the defective UiO-66 was also considered, which is an important met- ric in guaranteeing the stability of materials for realistic operation. The ML models after training showed an impressive R2 = 0.99 in predicting most of the target properties except for ethane/ethylene selectivity at 1 bar (R2 = 0.92). Surprisingly, from their feature importance analysis, it was revealed that the missing-linker ratio contributes to a wide range of target properties, while missing- linker SRO exhibits little response. This shows that it may be worthwhile to focus more on controlling the concentration of defects (rather than their distribution) in optimizing the separation performance of defective MOFs. Subsequently, DT classiﬁers were trained to identify necessary conditions for optimal ethane/ethy- lene separation in defective UiO-66 MOFs (Fig. 11). Here, it is important to note that surface area and pore volume serve as met- rics indicative of the defect ratio and distribution. As such, intro- ducing defects to reach the ideal range of SA and PV for separation would be a valid strategy to optimize the material per- formance. Although this work was carried out with limited data, several signiﬁcant contributions should be recognized: (1) descrip- tors for consideration of defects in MOFs were newly introduced, and (2) mechanical stability was considered in conjunction with the material performance. Outside the scope of chemical separa- tion, this work also suggests the application of ML to determine the defect ratio and distribution in MOFs, which cannot be easily determined from widely available experimental methods. 3.3. CO2 capture Along with the storage of gaseous energy sources, MOFs have also been extensively considered for carbon capture and sequestra- tion (CCS) [132]. In addition to their large pores, MOFs can also contain multiple active sites within their structures. A prominent type of such active sites is the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, or open metal sites (OMS), observed in MOFs containing metal clusters undercoordinated by construct, or metal-bearing linkers. Presence of OMS is known to greatly enhance the adsorp- tion strength of CO2, thus increasing the CO2 capture capacities of MOFs. Such effect is well-exempliﬁed in MOF-74, in which CO2 capture capacities can reach up to 350 mg/g [133]. Note that modeling of CO2 capture requires the consideration of electrostatic interactions, since the quadruple moment of CO2 results in their atomic charges. This inevitably increases the computational cost (e.g. Ewald summation, MOF partial charge calculation), making the brute force computational screening of CO2 capture in MOFs far more impractical. As such, utilization of ML methods for the accurate prediction of CO2 adsorption performance would aid the development of MOFs for CCS applications. Fernandez et al. [134] ﬁrst demonstrated the use of statistical ML for prediction of CO2 capture. Note that unlike their initial ML study of CH4 storage, here they immediately utilized AP-RDF as descriptors, which emphasizes the importance of chemical envi- ronment when predicting the CO2 adsorption behavior of MOFs. Rather than developing a model that would directly predict the absolute CO2 uptake, they approached the problem by aiming to classify the high performing MOFs with their ML models. Hence, instead of the regression models from previous works, SVM classi- ﬁers were used. Classiﬁcation thresholds were set at 1 mmol/g of CO2 adsorbed at 0.15 bar and 4 mmol/g at 4 bar, which are relevant conditions for CO2 capture from post-combustion ﬂue gas and landﬁll methane puriﬁcation, respectively. They ﬁrst trained the ML classiﬁers on 10% of 324,500 hypothetical MOF structures and achieved sensitivity and speciﬁcity values of 0.95 and 0.92 (perfect classiﬁer would show 1 for both), which are indicative of how well the models are performing their classiﬁcation on the training set. When the classiﬁers were used on the remaining 292,050 structures, good predictions of their performance were observed (Fig. 12). When a lower cutoff parameter for the classiﬁer was used, up to 95% of the MOFs identiﬁed by classiﬁers were true- positives, as conﬁrmed by actual GCMC results. With a higher cut- off parameter, 90% of the high-performing MOFs from the entire database were now labeled as positives, though this comes at an increase of the false-positives. Nonetheless, as the total number of MOFs for further consideration is still reduced to 28% of the total, this constitutes a remarkable improvement for screening Fig. 11. Decision tree (DT) classiﬁers identiﬁed from ML model training for the prediction of ethane/ethylene separation and ethane working capacity at 0.1 bar of defective UiO-66 MOFs. Percentage values at the termini show the highest probabilities that the categorized structure will fall into the speciﬁed performance category. Figure reproduced with permission from Ref. [131], Copyright 2020 American Chemical Society. 12 S. Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 purposes. As shown, there exists a trade-off in employing the ML classiﬁers stemming from their accuracy, and hence the sensitivity cutoff value should be ﬁxed depending on the core priority of research. In a separate work, Fernandez and Barnard [135] focused on making predictions solely based on the geometrical descriptors of MOFs (i.e. pore dimensions, surface areas, and void fraction). They focused on identifying MOFs that demonstrated CO2 uptake of higher than 1 mmol/g at 0.1 bar, 298 K. To ensure that a truly diverse set of structures are used for ML model building, k- means analysis and archetypal analysis were performed to identify prototypical/archetypal MOFs, and structures closest to the repre- sentative MOFs were used to build the training set. ML classiﬁers were trained using MLR, DT, K-nearest neighbor (kNN), RF, SVM, and ANN models. Their results showed that RF-based classiﬁer per- formed the best, with sensitivity of 0.74 and speciﬁcity of 0.94. Interestingly, it was found that the RF classiﬁer showed signiﬁ- cantly lower sensitivity towards ﬂuorine functional groups and copper paddlewheels. This demonstrated the importance of accu- rately accounting for these components in the molecular simula- tions during data compilation, using appropriate force ﬁeld parameters. In addition, their DT model identiﬁed three sets of conditions that are ideal for observing high CO2 uptake at the given conditions (Fig. 13). An important complication of CO2 capture is that CO2 must be captured from a mixture of several different gases (i.e. N2,H2O for post-combustion, H2 for pre-combustion, CH4 for methane puriﬁcation) in real operation scenarios. Hence, it is important to consider the selective adsorption behavior of the MOFs as well. As such, Aghaji et al. [136] used geometrical descriptors to rapidly identify the high-performing MOFs for methane puriﬁcation with high CO2 uptake and high selectivity. Four different ML models were built for the following classiﬁcation scenarios: working capacity higher than 2 or 4 mmol/g, CO2/CH4 selectivity higher than 5 or 10. In all cases, DT and SVM classiﬁers showed good per- formance, as evidenced by area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operator curve (ROC) plots being higher than 0.89 in all scenarios (perfect classiﬁer would return an AUC of 1). SVM showed better performance than DT in all cases with AUC reaching 0.95 when classifying MOFs based on the CO2/CH4 selectivity threshold of 5. Depending on the sensitivity cutoff, SVM classiﬁers were able to identify up to 90% of all the true-positives while only ﬂagging 23% of the test set as high-performing. Furthermore, the true-positives missed by the ML classiﬁers were revealed to be from the lower performance end of the spectrum, which addition- ally demonstrates the high utility of the ML classiﬁers trained in this work. In another work by Anderson and coworkers [137], they com- bined multiscale simulation methods and ML to understand the role of surface chemistry (as provided by functional groups) and pore topology of CO2 capture performances of MOFs. To precisely focus on the said characteristics, their study was limited to approx- imately 400 MOFs built from building blocks and topologies of their choice. From their DFT and GCMC simulations, they ﬁrst established that CO2 can exhibit notably different adsorption behavior depending on the functional groups on the linkers (Fig. 14a). Their further DT analysis showed that improvements in CO2 capture performance upon functionalization of a parent MOF depended mostly on the chemical descriptors of functional Fig. 13.

Then, DT, RF, NN, SVM, and gradient boosted machine (GBM) models were trained to predict absolute values of CO2 cap- ture performance metrics. Results showed that NN and GBM per- formed the best - both with R2 = 0.91 and Spearman ranking correlation coefﬁcient (SRCC) of 0.823 and 0.921, respectively, in predicting the CO2/N2 selectivity (Fig. 14b). They also showed that prediction of performance metric values with GBM having higher dependence on topology-related descriptors, which is contrary to the case with performance improvements. Their work demon- strates that smaller scale studies with ML can provide useful insights into understanding the roles that speciﬁc properties of MOFs play on material performance. In a more recent work by Dureckova et al. [138], MOF-based pre-combustion CO2 capture was considered. Their ML model was constructed to predict the working capacity and CO2/H2 selec- tivity of MOFs for pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) of CO2 from a 4:6 gas mixture of CO2/H2 at 313 K, operating between 40 bar for adsorption and 1 bar for desorption. A large dataset of 358,400 hypothetical MOFs was used, which were built from 1166 network topologies (c.f. 20 topologies in the earlier hMOF dataset) to better account for the structural diversity of MOFs. They adopted GBR as their model of choice, and used 80% of the dataset for training, 10% for validation, and remaining 10% for evaluation. The resulting GBR models showed remarkable predictive accuracies with only 6 geometrical descriptors and 3 AP-RDFs, reaching R2 values of 0.94 for working capacity and 0.87 for CO2/H2 selectivity. Notably, 997 of 1000 best performing MOFs as predicted by GCMC were found in the top 3000 list from the GBR models for both metrics. This work constitutes a signiﬁcant improvement over the earlier works on CO2 capture prediction with ML classiﬁers, as the best performing MOFs can now be identiﬁed from only a few thousand additional GCMC calculations. 3.4. Generalized adsorption modeling In most of the studies presented thus far, ML models were used for the prediction of MOF performance under a single set of spec- iﬁed conditions for gas adsorption. That is, the GCMC simulations used for model training were conducted at very speciﬁc conditions for a target adsorbate, and hence ML model would only be capable of making predictions for those given conditions. However, one could envision that if the models trained with a consideration for their generality, ML can be used to make adsorption predictions of an arbitrary gas molecule for a variety of different conditions. Note that few of the already-presented works have made such efforts and were successful in doing so [119,121]. In this section, we present more ML-based adsorption prediction studies in which Fig. 14. a) Sample results of DFT calculations conducted to study the adsorption behavior of CO2 with different functional groups found in MOFs. b) ML-prediction vs. GCMC- prediction of CO2/N2 selectivity for neural network (NN), random forest (RF), gradient boosted machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and multiple linear regression (MLR).

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 a generalized ML model is trained to make adsorption predictions under a variety of applicable conditions. In a work by Desgranges and Delhommelle [139], ensemble learning models were used to predict the partition function of the adsorbates in MOFs and COFs. Their approach involved the learning of canonical partition functions of single components or binary mixtures from expanded Wand-Landau (EWL) simulations. As the partition functions are directly predicted by ML, this would offer access to the relevant thermodynamic properties via statisti- cal mechanics formalism. ANN was used for their study, where the input layer consists of number of adsorbate molecules and temper- atures, and output layer consists of partition functions and poten- tial energies. Unlike most other studies using the simulated adsorption data from GCMC simulations, their approach used the results of EWL simulations for ANN model training. Results showed that the trained ANN models perform very well in predicting the partition functions, with the parity plot comparing actual data and predicted data tracing a straight line at y = x. The partition functions could then be used to compute various thermodynamic properties, from adsorption capacities to methane/ethane selectiv- ity within a given porous material, as shown in Fig. 15. Since the ANN model can predict the partition function under new condi- tions, it can map the whole thermodynamic space while signiﬁ- cantly reducing the computational cost associated with running multiple EWL simulations for a number of inputs. Their ANN mod- els were able to correctly predict that COF-102 would show higher methane/ethane selectivity than COF-108, and also provide the entire selectivity map for COF-102 (see Fig. 15c). While their approach requires a separate ML model for each material of inter- est, it shows great potential in making very accurate performance predictions (e.g. excess uptake, desorption free energy) for a given material under numerous conditions. Recently, Anderson and coworkers [89] reported the construc- tion of a multilayer perception (MLP) model that can predict the adsorption isotherms for multiple molecules in MOFs, under a number of conditions. To train the ML model to make predictions for a wide range of adsorbates, their actual training data was col- lected for 200 one/two-atom ‘‘alchemical” adsorbates described Fig. 15.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 15 by a range of ﬁctitious point charges and Lennard-Jones parame- ters. Note that none of these alchemical adsorbates carried the actual force ﬁeld parameters of real molecules used for latter vali- dation, which was purposefully done to authenticate the predic- tion ability of the ML model with real adsorbates later on. 2400 hypothetical MOFs were built using ToBaCCo for the ML training, and in creating the input ‘‘ﬁngerprint” for the MOFs, the usual geo- metrical descriptors and chemical moiety number densities were used. Another set of descriptors were now introduced to account for the adsorbates, which comprised of their effective Lennard- Jones force ﬁeld parameters, maximum charge magnitude, and bond length information. Model training was conducted with 1800 hypothetical frameworks, and the remaining 400 and 200 structures were later used for validation and testing, respectively. The resulting MLP model performed exceptionally, making accu- rate predictions of adsorbate loadings in with mean absolute per- centage error (MAPE) of around 4.5%, for real adsorbates that it was never trained with (Fig. 16). The model was also capable of predicting adsorption isotherms, exhibiting isotherm mean per- centage error (IMPE, mean of APE at multiple points along the iso- therm) of around 4% on average. Notably, when the MLP model was applied on 1528 real, experimental MOFs from the Computation-Ready Experimental (CoRE) MOF database, it retained its prediction accuracy, as shown by the MAPE values for adsorbates ranging from of 9.5 to 16.3% when used to predict adsorbate loading. The model was also adept at making correct ranking predictions for adsorbate working capacities, showing a spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient of 0.97 on average when used to make predictions for the CoRE MOFs. Interestingly, when their MLP model was used to make predictions for more complex molecules (i.e. C3, C4, benzene), consistent trend of underestima- tion was observed (Fig. 16). This was attributed to the increasingly complex morphologies of the new adsorbates, which the model was not exposed to during training. In another work by Fanourgakis et al. [88], authors considered the use of previously introduced average Boltzmann factors as descriptors for ML, but now for a range of hypothetical polar and nonpolar probe atoms (Fig. 17a) for further generalization of their ML model. To account for different ways in which charge may be distributed in an adsorbate, three distinct charge schemes were considered for the probe atoms: (1) Vprobe, which does not have a point charge and only participates in dispersion interactions, (2) Qprobe, which bears a single point charge at the center of its position, and (3) Dprobe, which contains opposite point charges of equal magnitude separated by a distance vector. RF was used as the ML model of choice, and the aforementioned descriptors were combined with 6 structural descriptors as inputs. Model training was conducted for 2932 CoRE MOFs for which partial charge information is available. Their resulting RF model per- formed remarkably, showcasing desirable R2 values of up to 0.95 Fig. 16.

To understand the different prediction behaviors based on the type of the probe atoms deﬁned, case studies were conducted where descriptors from only one type of probe atom were used. it was found that when the target adsorbate does not exhibit a point charge, then the use of Vprobe descriptors for the RF model returned the best accuracies. Conversely, using Qprobe and Dprobe resulted in much better performances compared to Vprobe when the target adsorbate contained dipole moments. The signiﬁcance of their generalized model is demonstrated by its prediction accu- racy for CO2 adsorption at low pressures, which was improved to R2 = 0.84, much higher compared to the earlier ML models used for CO2. Another important aspect of generalization is the transferability of the resulting ML model. In deﬁning the chemical descriptors of MOFs, most previous works either considered whole building blocks (i.e. functional groups) as distinct units, and simply distin- guished atoms by their atomic number. This building block approach hinders the transferability of the ML model, because it would not be applicable to a dataset containing foreign building blocks previously unencountered during training. Conversely, the simple atomic approach results in over-generalization and limits the prediction accuracy of the model. In a recent study by Fanour- gakis and coworkers [86], a new approach for chemical description of MOF was introduced, which effectively balances the two previ- ous strategies. Here, their chemical descriptors were prepared on the basis of atom types. While this approach also breaks down the consideration into individual atoms, it reﬂects their participa- tion in different chemistries by further splitting the type catego- rization (e.g. C atom in a methyl functional group and C atom in a benzene ring are treated separately). In doing so, enough chem- ical information is conserved to make accurate predictions, while retaining the ability to consider any new material by breaking them down to their constituent atom types. The resulting RF models trained with these new descriptors showed much improved prediction accuracy for both CH4 and CO2 at a number of different conditions. R2 values were signiﬁ- cantly higher compared to other sets of descriptors, and much smaller test sets were needed to achieve a reasonable level of prediction accuracy (e.g. R2 = 0.8 reached with only 250 training data for CH4). The true power of their approach is demonstrated when a RF model trained on MOF data is used to make predictions for COFs, an entirely different class of materials. Surprisingly, a high accuracy of R2 = 0.88 was achieved in making the predictions, which is attributed to the use of generalizable atom type descrip- tors that can be easily used for COFs as well. These results vividly demonstrate that incorporation of atomic type descriptors to describe material chemistry is a convenient strategy to guarantee the transferability of ML models for adsorption prediction. 3.5. Mechanical properties For the MOFs to be successfully employed in various application ﬁelds, the framework would have to be chemically, thermally, and mechanically stable enough to withstand multiple cycles of opera- tion [140]. It is particularly important to consider the mechanical stability of MOFs, as they are relatively more ﬂexible and mechan- ically responsive compared to other rigid crystalline materials. In the most basic sense, their intrinsic ﬂexibility results from the local degrees of freedom associated with individual framework compo- nents. Some MOFs (i.e. MIL-53, MIL-88, DUT-49) can even exhibit mechanical ﬂexibility at a much larger scale [141–144], in which the arrangement of metal clusters and linkers allow them to act like ‘‘hinges” for correlated structural transition of the whole crys- tal. In these cases, mechanical ﬂexibility of the MOF can even be exploited to maximize material performance in the application ﬁeld of interest. Hence, it becomes important to predict and control the mechanical properties of MOFs for their successful implemen- tation. Currently however, large-scale computational evaluation of MOFs for their mechanical properties is hindered by the high com- putational cost of the DFT simulations and overreliance on the force ﬁeld parameters in classical MD. Hence, use of ML presents itself as an attractive alternative approach that can be used to ana- lyze the mechanical properties of MOFs. To gain a better grasp on how ML models can be used to predict mechanical properties of MOFs, it would be worthwhile to discuss their application for zeolites. In a work by Evans and Coudert [145], GBR model was trained to predict the Voigt-Reuss-Hill averages of Fig. 17.

(b) Pearson coefﬁcient values of the ML models trained by the hypothetical probes in predicting the adsorption capacities of MOFs for different adsorbates. Figures adapted with permission from Ref.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 17 bulk and shear (K and G) moduli of zeolites, which are metrics that describe the compressibility and response shear, respectively. 32 descriptors were used for their model, which included crystal den- sity, space group, surface area, pore volume, pore size, dimension- ality, Si-O bond length, Si-O-Si angle distribution, etc. (note that many of these descriptors can be deﬁned easily for MOFs as well). Their training set consisted of 121 data points for pure silica zeo- lites obtained from DFT calculations. The resulting GBR model per- formed very well (Fig. 18a), exhibiting an RMSE of 0.10 and 0.08 for log(K) and log(G). These values compared well to the results obtained in another work where ML was used to predict the elastic moduli of inorganic crystalline compounds [146]. This level of accuracy is quite promising in that it can easily match or even out- perform the conventional force ﬁeld-based predictions made from molecular simulations. In fact, when the RMSE of GBR model was compared with the results from direct molecular simulation, it was found to exhibit the lowest error in almost all cases. From fea- ture importance analysis of the descriptors, it was found that bond lengths, angles, and pore sizes contribute the most in the ML model-based predictions of K and G. Their GBR model was then used to analyze 500,000 hypothetical zeolites for their mechanical properties, which revealed that hypothetical structures are signif- icantly less stiff and shear-resistant than the known, IZA zeolites (Fig. 18b). This study demonstrates the aptness of ML methods in predicting mechanical properties of porous materials. It also shows that if trained with higher-level theory data, the ML model may even show higher accuracy compared to conventional FF-based methods with even a small training dataset. In a recent work by Moghadam and coworkers [147], mechani- cal properties of MOFs were systemically analyzed for the ﬁrst time using multiscale modeling approach on a set of 3385 hypo- thetical MOFs with diverse geometries and topologies. Initially, high-throughput screening with classical molecular simulations was conducted to compute K and G for the MOFs included in the dataset. Many interesting correlations were revealed from the resulting data, especially on how the linker length, maximum coor- dination number (MCN), pore volume and surface area would affect the elastic moduli of the material. To amend their discussion, ANN was constructed and used to predict the elastic moduli of MOFs, based on 13 judiciously chosen geometrical descriptors. To speciﬁcally focus on the importance of topology in the resulting mechanical properties of MOFs, two separate ANN models were built, one with and another without topology information incorpo- rated as descriptors. Remarkably, the resulting two ANN models showed striking dif- ferences in their prediction accuracies. The model without topolog- ical descriptors only exhibited R2 = 0.70, while the ANN model with topological descriptors exhibited R2 = 0.98, as shown in Fig. 19. This shows that there’s an important, unignorable correlation between topologies and the resulting mechanical properties of MOFs. A more in-depth analysis revealed that ANN without topol- ogy descriptors performed worse in making predictions for MOFs with larger bulk modulus, whereas the latter model retained its high accuracy for all modulus ranges. Their ML-based analysis was followed by MD simulations on a select few structures, where force ﬁeld parameters derived from ab initio methods were used. The MD results nicely corroborated the trends previously observed from ANN and large-scale screening, especially where bulk modu- lus would decrease with the equilibrium cell length (roughly pro- portional to LCD or linker length). MD simulations were further conducted to estimate the pressure at which loss-of-crystallinity would be observed, and results show that there’s a notable linear correlation between this and the bulk modulus. These results show that ML models are very useful in analyzing the mechanical prop- erties of MOFs, and topology and linker length plays an important role in determining the resulting mechanical stability of MOFs. 3.6. Electrical conductivity Due to their large pore sizes and electrically inactive compo- nents (i.e. closed-shell metals, carboxylate linkers) generally used in the synthesis, MOFs have been mainly considered as electrical insulators. Nonetheless, a groundbreaking research in 2012 by Dinca˘ and coworkers [39] showed that with rational design, MOFs Fig. 18.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 can be rendered to become electrically conductive while retaining their permanent porosity. Following this monumental work, sev- eral other electrically conductive MOFs have been successfully dis- covered [40,42,148], where the experimentally observed conductivity have reached up to 1580 S/cm [149]. These MOFs have been implemented for various applications, ranging from ﬁeld-effect transistors [150], chemiresistive sensors [44,45],to supercapacitors [43]. Use of conductive MOFs for various electrical applications can be quite attractive, as their intrinsic nanoporosity can potentially maximize the contact between the conductive pathways and molecules of interest, which are often needed for application. However, there exists a very limited number of known conductive MOFs, most of which have been obtained from the rational design of individual MOF systems. If ML techniques can be successfully incorporated here, discovery of new electrically conductive MOFs for novel applications can be tremendously expedited. In a pioneering study be He et al. [151], application of ML meth- ods for the prediction of metallicity in MOFs was demonstrated for the ﬁrst time. It must be recognized that computational consider- ation of electrical conductivity, commonly judged by the material energy band gap, inevitably involves high quality ab initio calcula- tions. This then requires a considerable amount of computational resources to even analyze a single material. MOFs can be even more computationally demanding than other materials, due to their chemical diversity and large unit cell sizes. To overcome these fundamental limitations, transfer learning technique was uniquely used in this study (see Fig. 20a). That is, ML models were ﬁrst trained using data from a different but relevant class of materials, and then the trained models were ‘‘transferred” and used to make predictions for MOFs. Four different ML models (LR, support vector classiﬁcation (SVC), NN, RF) were trained from DFT-predicted band gap data of 52,300 inorganic compounds found in the Open Quantum Materi- als Database. 45 material descriptors were used, which were deﬁned by nine elemental properties and their ﬁve statistical quantities over the chemical formula of each material. Binary clas- siﬁcation was expected of the ML models, where output of 1 denotes the presence of a band gap, and \u00031 denotes its absence, hence signaling the metallicity of the material. Successful learning of the inorganic material data was observed in the resulting ML models, where accuracies between 88% (LR) and 97% (RF) were seen (see Fig. 20b). Prior to making predictions for MOFs, t- distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was performed to compare the distribution of MOFs and training set inorganic materials on the same two-dimensional feature space.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 19 regions of overlap were observed, which conﬁrmed that the ML models trained on inorganic materials could be used on MOFs with reasonable applicability. A multivoting scheme was adopted in the transfer learning pro- cess, where the results from all four ML models were gathered, and if a given MOF was predicted to be metallic by more than two mod- els, the structure was ultimately labeled as metallic. Analysis was performed on 2932 MOFs found in the CoRE MOF database, and the ML models were able to identify nine potentially metallic MOFs from the multivoting results. Of these nine identiﬁed structures, six of them were conﬁrmed to be metallic from further DFT calcu- lations, which results in 67% accuracy of the multivoting ML scheme. This level of accuracy could be seen as consistent with the degree of overlap previously observed from t-SNE feature space. DFT-predicted band structures of the six MOFs showed large band dispersions and wide bandwidths, which indicate larger car- rier mobilities and carrier densities in these materials. The struc- tures of six identiﬁed MOFs are rather deviant from what is commonly expected of MOFs, perhaps due to the usage of inor- ganic material data for ML model training. Nonetheless, successful application of ML demonstrated in this work proves that ML meth- ods can shed light on important features that would lead to electri- cal conductivity, hence expediting the discovery of new, electrically conductive MOFs. 3.7. Synthesis optimization Thus far, we have focused on the use of computational methods in identifying candidate MOFs for various applications based on the computational prediction of their physicochemical properties. This approach has been quite useful in screening through the wide material space of MOFs and ﬁnding the optimal combination of MOF building blocks that produces the best performance. Here we discuss another important aspect to be considered, which is the synthesizability of identiﬁed MOFs. Direct simulation of the chemical processes associated with the synthesis of MOFs, or any other crystalline material as a matter of fact, is incredibly complex, as it requires the knowledge of the entire potential-energy surface of the involved reactions. As a remedy, ML could be used to completely shift the paradigm where ML would be performed directly on the compiled data from numerous material synthesis attempts. In doing so, ML model could approach the synthesizabil- ity issue from a higher dimensional space, and identify the required experimental conditions for the synthesis of coveted materials. In a study by Raccuglia et al. [152], one of the ﬁrst successful applications of ML to crystalline material synthesis optimization, 3955 experimental data entries that contain both successful and unsuccessful attempts for inorganic material synthesis were used for ML. In training their SVM model, physicochemical information of organic molecular reactants, atomic properties of inorganic reac- tants, their molar ratios, and reaction conditions were used as descriptors. The resulting SVM model exhibited 78% accuracy in predicting the outcomes of material synthesis from the given set of reaction conditions. This model was then used to predict the outcome of material synthesis under experimental scenarios in which 34 previously unseen diamines were introduced as new reactants. Strikingly, the model exhibited an 89% ‘‘success rate”, which is deﬁned as the fraction of experiments under ML- recommended reaction conditions that resulted in the successful synthesis of crystalline materials. In fact, this success rate was found to be meaningfully higher than that of the recommendations made from human intuitions, which was 78%. These results show that it is indeed possible to optimize the synthesis conditions of crystalline materials using ML methods, even beyond the human intuition. Such a strategy can be extended to optimization of MOF synthesis as well, as long as sufﬁcient experimental data of different outcomes is available for ML model training. In a recent work by Moosavi and coworkers [153], ML methods were applied to optimize the synthesis conditions of MOFs for the ﬁrst time. Even for a well-known MOF such as HKUST-1, synthesis conditions reported in the literature can vastly differ by research group, and resulting properties of the synthesized samples inevita- bly show a wide range (e.g. surface area ranging from 300 to 2000 m2/g). As it is largely unclear how each experimental variable involved in MOF synthesis would affect the resulting properties, it remains a challenge to systematically develop an efﬁcient strategy for the screening of MOF synthesis conditions. In this work, genetic Fig. 20. (a) Transfer learning approach adopted in the study by He et al. to predict the electrical conductivity of MOFs.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 algorithm (GA) was initially used to optimize the synthesis condi- tions so that crystallinity and phase purity of HKUST-1 would be optimized. Nine variables were used to deﬁne the synthesis dimen- sions, and after three generations of optimization, conditions to achieve samples with BET surface area of 2045 m2/g was identiﬁed, which is very close to the theoretical limit of 2153 m2/g for HKUST-1. Following the GA approach, a RF model was trained to capture the chemical intuition involved in the synthesis of HKUST-1. With the nine synthesis variables as inputs, model training was per- formed to predict the resulting crystallinity and phase purity of the samples. The model impressively showed a MAE of 8% in cross-validation. The constructed RF model was then analyzed to study the relative importance of each variable used in deﬁning the synthesis conditions (Fig. 21b). Among the variables, amount of H2O and DMF solvents used for synthesis were revealed to have the biggest impact on the synthesis outcomes. The relative impor- tance of different variables was then used to construct the weighted chemical space of HKUST-1 (Fig. 21c). Results showed that the Euclidean distances between data points (each represent- ing a synthesis attempt) can change dramatically compared to the unweighted chemical space (Fig. 21a). Closer distance between two points indicate similarity of the given set of synthesis condi- tions. Hence, it is ideal to obtain the most diverse set of points from the weighted chemical space in screening and optimizing the synthesis conditions for HKUST-1. The successful capture of chemical intuition by the RF model was then demonstrated by considering the change of metal ions, from Cu(II) to Zn(II), to obtain Zn-HKUST-1. At ﬁrst, top ten synthesis conditions for Cu-HKUST-1 were blindly adopted for Zn-HKUST-1, where none of the attempts resulted in crystalline samples. Subsequently, diverse sampling was conducted to obtain 20 sets of conditions from the unweighted chemical space of Zn-HKUST-1. Unfortunately, none of these attempts resulted in successful synthesis of the MOF. Finally, to observe the validity of chemical intuition acquired by ML, diverse sampling of synthesis Fig. 21.

Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 21 conditions was conducted from the chemical space weighted with previously determined importance of variables. Remarkably, two of the 20 sampled conditions resulted in the successful synthesis of Zn-HKUST-1. A closer look of the data distribution on the weighted chemical space of Zn-HKUST-1 (Fig. 21d) revealed that unweighted sampling exhibited in an uneven distribution, where several clusters of points were found. Conversely, data points sam- pled from the weighted chemical space showed a far more even distribution. This shows that accounting for the chemical intuition can dramatically increase the synthesis screening efﬁciency by pri- oritizing the most important variables. In these works, perhaps the most important aspect in applying ML is the availability of data pertaining to the numerous failed syn- thesis attempts. Almost always, researchers only report successful synthesis of materials in publications, and omit any information about the failed experiments that would have taken place along the way. However, it is important to recognize that both successes and failures must be present in a ML dataset for the resulting model to suitably identify the required synthesis conditions. As Moosavi et al. emphasizes, if synthetic research groups can collec- tively participate in the systematic reporting of their MOF synthe- sis attempts, enough data will be accumulated for better ML model training. In such a case, ML will be able to revolutionize MOF research by guiding the experimentalists along the most efﬁcient path for the successful, optimal synthesis of their target MOFs. 4. ML-assisted design of MOFs and other porous materials In the previous section, we summarized many of the important works focused on using ML to predict various material properties of MOFs. On the other hand, using ML (or deep learning) to gener- ate new MOF structures, and perhaps more importantly design user-desired MOFs via inverse design has yet to be extensively explored and pose much more of a signiﬁcant challenge. Broadly speaking, small drug molecules have been successfully designed using various generative models [100] due to their relatively sim- ple structures; but only a limited number of studies have been con- ducted on generating crystalline materials [73,154,155], and especially porous materials [94,156,157], due to their complex nat- ure (e.g. periodicity and larger number of atoms). Recently, Lee et al. [156] predicted the performance limit of methane gas storage in zeolites by using generative ANN models. Their idea was to predict the maximum adsorption capacity of a zeolites by measuring its properties by creating as many as possi- ble volumetric images called energy shape which can be one-to- one mapped to actual zeolite (Fig. 22). The energy shape is a three-dimensional grid data that contains interaction energy between methane and the zeolite. GCMC simulations can be con- ducted directly on energy shape because it contains the interac- tion energy between adsorbate and the zeolite. In order to create energy shapes similar to but more diverse than those obtained from actual zeolites, they developed generative model based on the generative adversarial network (GAN)[158] and named it energy shape GAN (ESGAN). They conﬁrmed that the adsorption properties (e.g. CH4 heat of adsorption and void frac- tion) of ESGAN-generated energy shapes have a similar distribu- tion to those of zeolite used in the dataset. In particular, it was shown that the maximum value of CH4 deliverable capacity deduced from the generated energy shapes has a value of 156.74 cm3/cm3, which is almost identical to the maximum deliv- erable capacity value of 159.41 cm3/cm3 of actual known zeolites. Even more interesting is that even if the maximum value of the deliverable capacity of training set zeolites was limited to 100 cm3/cm3, ESGAN still successfully generated energy shapes with the maximum deliverable capacity values close to that of the actual zeolites. This nicely demonstrates the ESGAN’s ability to generate diverse energy shapes for the entire class of materials in consideration. Fig. 22. (a) The unit cells of 4 zeolites (BEA, ABW, ACO, LTA) and their corresponding energy shapes. (b) Energy shapes that were successfully generated by ESGAN. Figures reproduced with permission from Ref. [156], Copyright 2019 Royal Society of Chemistry. 22 S. Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 The downside of the aforementioned ESGAN model is that it cannot generate actual material structures. To remedy this prob- lem, Kim et al. [157] developed another generative ML model named zeolite GAN (ZeoGAN) that can generate actual nanoporous zeolite structures. ZeoGAN is based on the ESGAN architecture, but unlike its predecessor, ZeoGAN now takes the material shape as an additional input (Fig. 23). The material shape is given in a three- dimensional grid that contains atomic positions smeared by Gaus- sian function. Material shape grid and energy shape grid was deﬁned to be present as different channels of the three- dimensional image, much like the RGB channels in image process- ing. Trained ZeoGAN was shown to successfully generate material shapes and energy shapes similar to that of the actual zeolites from the volumetric image data. In order to obtain the actual structures from these volumetric images, a post-processing algorithm that can construct zeolite structures from the generated material shapes was developed. Additionally, using the fact that the adsorp- tion properties can be calculated directly from the energy shape, they added a penalty function to the loss function of the ZeoGAN network to generate zeolites with the user-desired range of prop- erties. From their ﬁnal ZeoGAN model with penalty-added loss function, they demonstrated that zeolites exhibiting methane heat of adsorption in a narrow, user-desired range of 18–22 kJ/mol can be exclusively generated. In another work, Zhang et al. [159] developed a new ML approach that can discover MOFs with user-desired properties by generating an optimal organic linker for a given metal node and topology net. On the provided set of metal node, topology and tar- get application (property), Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) as implemented in ChemTS [160] is performed to generate an organic linker that optimizes the target property. Here, organic linkers are represented in the Simpliﬁed Molecular Input Line Entry (SMILES) format [97]. In their MCTS formulation, the value of each node in the tree would be a character allowed for SMILES. This means that moving along a speciﬁc ‘‘branch” of the search tree would result in a full SMILES description of an organic linker. Recurrent neural net- work (RNN) is used to predict the value of the child node from the values of parent nodes. Then, the reward values for MCTS are cal- culated using GCMC simulations. In testing their approach, they applied this method to ten metal nodes and topology combinations of existing MOFs. They found that their approach can successfully design new MOFs with performance higher than that of existing MOFs for methane-storage applications and carbon-capture applications. More recently, Yao et al. [94] successfully demonstrated a ML- based MOF generation scheme by devising and constructing supramolecular variational autoencoder (SmVAE) (Fig. 24). In a variational autoencoder (VAE), two separate neural networks are constructed for unsupervised learning: one acts as an encoder that maps an input into the latent space, and another functions as a decoder that decodes a point from the latent space into the original format. In SmVAE, RFcode was used as the MOF representation of choice, which in turn enabled for the facile deconstruction and reconstruction of MOFs. Note that this representation scheme allows for the edges, vertices, and topologies to be treated individ- ually. As such, the authors were able to focus their considerations to 14 metal and 47 organic vertices, and 152 topologies. As for the edges, ~300,000 augmented edges dataset was generated and used for model training. To validate the successful construction of a latent MOF space using SmVAE, a known MOF, NU-1104, was iden- tiﬁed within the latent space. Then, neighboring points with vary- ing distances were surveyed to conﬁrm that structural similarity of sampled MOFs is inversely proportional to their distance from the reference point. They also performed an interpolation between two distinct MOFs, NU-1104 and NU-1000, within the latent space, and observed a smooth transition from the cubic MOF to hexagonal MOF in the intermediate materials. Ultimately, it is desirable to utilize SmVAE for the ‘‘inverse design” of MOFs, where frameworks with the best performance for target applications can be efﬁciently identiﬁed and generated. To do so, SmVAE must be trained to also simultaneously predict material performance as well as deconstruct and reconstruct mate- rials, and hence loss function for the prediction of target properties should be additionally deﬁned. In this work, CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation were chosen as applications of interest. Then, additional material properties (i.e. geometrical descriptors) and selective CO2 capture performance data of randomly chosen 40,000 MOFs were newly incorporated during ML training. To screen through the latent space of jointly trained SmVAE, Gaussian Process (GP) model was developed. Remarkably, their compound model was able to identify and generate MOFs with superb separation performances. The best generated MOF (GMOF-9) exhibited CO2/CH4 selectivity of 16 while capturing 7.55 mol/kg of CO2, and CO2/N2 selectivity of 24.6 while capturing 2.8 mol/kg of CO2. These performances are comparable to that of the best adsorbent materials known to date. Fig. 23.

Conclusion and outlook Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as an important tool that can reveal correlations and patterns that are not easy to discern using other conventional techniques. As seen in the research works that appear in this review, it is obvious ML meth- ods have had a great impact on MOF research as well. While signif- icant progress has been made thus far, application of ML methods to MOFs has only just begun. We anticipate there to be a signiﬁcant increase in the number of works devoted to improving and expanding the utilization of ML techniques to develop and to pre- dict material properties of MOFs in the nearby future. For the remainder of this section, we share our own perspectives on the outlook of ML utilization in various ﬁelds of MOF research. Many descriptors have already been developed and used for the prediction of MOF properties using ML. These descriptors range from pore volume, surface area, and building block counts, to aver- age Boltzmann factors and energy histograms. Depending on the property of interest, the most effective set of descriptors for ML can vary signiﬁcantly, and as such, it would be important to con- tinue the development of various MOF descriptors for ML, which can then be utilized for different scenarios and further enhance the ML model performances. Descriptors that are more speciﬁc to MOFs could potentially improve the resulting ML model perfor- mance, and one possibility would be descriptors that consider indi- vidual building blocks of MOFs as ‘‘superatoms”. This would enable the highly efﬁcient and modular description of material’s structure that is unique to MOFs. Such descriptors would then be used to reveal the performance trends of MOFs as determined and distin- guished by the actual building blocks used in MOF synthesis. They can also be utilized in conjunction with currently employed atomic-level descriptors for a hierarchical, in-depth consideration of a given MOF. Perhaps due to the relative ease of performance prediction via computational methods and abundance of data from such simula- tions, many of the works presented here have performed ML from pre-existing simulation data. A new, propitious direction for ML utilization in MOF research would be its direct involvement in the molecular simulations of MOFs. Recently, construction of neu- ral networks for the description of potential energy surfaces of var- ious chemical entities has been successfully demonstrated [161,162]. These ‘‘neural network potentials” are impressive in that their accuracy is comparable to DFT methods, yet their speed is remarkably faster than DFT calculations. Similar methods are being developed for MOFs as well, as seen in several recent publi- cations [163,164]. Note that the conventional molecular simula- tions (e.g. MD and GCMC) involve generalized force ﬁelds that are often much less accurate than DFT calculations. Hence, the use of ML-based neural network potentials will greatly enhance the accuracy of computational methods and better facilitate the prediction of MOF performance. A clearly recognizable trend in the research works presented in this review is that most of them have performed supervised learn- ing, where a fully labeled dataset is provided for classiﬁcation and regression tasks. In the future, we expect other modes of ML, such as semi-supervised learning or unsupervised learning, to be more actively incorporated into MOF research. In semi-supervised learn- ing, ML model itself would predict and determine the labels for a large set of unlabeled data by learning from a small subset of labeled data. Such semi-supervised learning would be immensely beneﬁcial in considering a large number of MOFs, especially for properties (e.g. catalytic activity, electrical conductivity) that require direct experimental efforts or expensive DFT-level calcula- tions. With unsupervised learning, where no labels are given in the data provided, ML models could uncover previously unknown trends in MOFs. This would lead to improved understanding of the intrinsic properties of these materials. We also anticipate gen- erative models to play a much more direct and signiﬁcant role in the design of new MOFs. Here, we note that the purely atomic approach previously seen in zeolites and other inorganic materials would be highly inefﬁcient for MOF generation. Instead, a genera- tive ML architecture specialized for MOFs should be developed, Fig. 24. Schematics of supramolecular variational autoencoder (SmVAE) that can be used for the latent space consideration of MOFs and other reticular frameworks. A MOF can be encoded into an RFcode for the mapping of its latent material space. Conversely, an RFcode can be decoded to obtain the respective framework. Figure reproduced from Ref. [94]. 24 S. Chong et al. / Coordination Chemistry Reviews 423 (2020) 213487 which takes full advantage of their modularity. An example of such architecture would be comprised of the following: generative mod- els for MOF building blocks (i.e. organic linkers and metal clusters), separate generative model for topologies, then a constructor which would assemble a new MOF from the generated components. Lastly, we envisage that ML methods will be used to effectively bridge the gap between computational and experimental efforts in MOF research. While computational works have made monumen- tal contributions to the research ﬁeld, they often lack a thorough consideration of experimental synthesis. This is especially the case for computational design of new MOFs. Numerous hypothetical MOFs can be generated for various applications, yet their synthe- sizability is not sufﬁciently addressed. Luckily, as seen in few of the works presented in this review, ML models can effectively guide researchers toward successful synthesis conditions if trained with relevant data. We believe such models can then be applied to discern whether or not a proposed hypothetical MOF is experimen- tally synthesizable. It then becomes important to continue the gathering of experimental data from existing publications. Since such data are limited in that they often only provide one set of suc- cessful synthesis conditions, it would also be tremendously helpful to establish an online repository where experimental data from both successful and failed synthesis attempts can be freely reported (similar to one proposed by Moosavi et al.). With such a database, more ML-based studies could be performed to directly consider the synthetic feasibility, scalability, long-term stability, etc. of MOFs. While we have provided several prospective research directions hitherto, we are conﬁdent there exist many other opportunities for ML to be incorporated into MOF research. We look forward to observing new ways in which the conventional computational screening methods will be integrated with ML, and also how the emergent developments in the ML ﬁeld would be incorporated to further enhance design and development of new MOFs.
