These particles have attracted much attention in recent years due to their dual functionality, anisotropic nature and potential applications in material science and biomedicine such as nanocorals, micro/nanomotors, catalyst, and stabilizers. With the presence of different functional group and various chemical compounds on each side, JNPs can simultaneously be modiﬁed for speciﬁc needs in drug delivery, such as loading two drugs, grafting with a targeting ligand and imaging agents. Moreover, the site-selective modiﬁcation of each face allows combining different agents within a single particle without signiﬁcant interaction, leading to their versatile usage in theranostics. This review discusses the main strategies used for synthesizing JNPs with controllable morphology in a wide range of sizes and surface functionality by highlighting JNPs important properties and applications in the ﬁeld of drug delivery with a focus on theranostics. © 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction The term ‘Janus’ comes from an ancient Roman god, who has two different faces on both sides of his head [1]. Janus nanoparti- cles (JNPs) refer to anisotropic nanoparticles that are a combination of two distinct sides with differences in polarity and/or chemical nature [2]. Generally, there are two main groups of JNPs: patchy plasmon resonance; PCL, poly(3-caprolactone); AuNC, gold nanocage; GNRs-mSiO2, Gold nanorods- mesoporous silica; MSOT, multispectral photoacoustic tomog- raphy; JVs, Janus vesicles; MNPs, magnetic NPs; BCP, block copolymer; AuNPs, gold nanoparticles; PA, photoacoustic imaging; DSPE-PEG-COOH, 1,2-distearoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-carboxy-polyethyleneglycol; Cy5, Cyanine5; EPR effect, enhanced permeability and retention effect; cRGD, cyclic RGD pep- tide; OI, optical imaging; Ach, acetylcholine; Ru(bpy)3] Cl2, Tris(2,2-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II)chloride; P-Et, phenyleneethylene; Cr, chromium; Pt, platinum; PC, phosphatidylcholine; A-HMS, ammoniated-hollow mesoporous silica; VLPs, Virus- like nanoparticles; JVNs, Janus Virus Nanomotors; BMV, Brome mosaic virus; CCMV, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus; Tz, tetrazine; TCo, trans-cyclooctene; bMS, big magnetic microsphere; sMS, small magnetic microsphere; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry; CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen; Ag, antigen; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RJPs, retroreﬂective Janus microparticles. ∗ Corresponding author.

Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 Fig. 1. Common structures of JNPs: patchy and compartment particles. particles (particle with anisotropic on the surface) and compart- mented particles (particle with anisotropic in composition and multiple eccentric phase-separated domains [3] (Fig. 1). Depending on the synthesis strategies, JNPs can be made from organic, inor- ganic and metallic materials [4]. Moreover, JNPs can be amphiphilic (If one hemisphere is hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic) or dipolar (if one hemisphere is negative charge and the other is posi- tive charge), or they might possess other asymmetric properties. Due to different composition or surface functional groups, JNPs might also have asymmetric complex structures. Its various shapes have been synthesized, such as: simple sphere, diff ;erent kinds of dumbbell shape, vesicles/capsules and other anisotropic architec- tures as cylindrical or disk like. The most common structures of JNP’s are spherical shapes, commonly with one hydrophobic half and the other hydrophilic half [5]. Compared with homogenous nanoparticles, the beauty of JNPs is that these nanoparticles are asymmetric and as a single par- ticle, have diff ;erent chemical or physical properties [6]. The homogenous nanoparticles enable co-delivery of two hydrophobic or two hydrophilic drugs while the complex JNPs can simultane- ously encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs [7,8]. This ability allows them to simultaneously deliver and release dis- similar drugs for producing synergistic effects at the target site. Anisotropic JNPs also have further advantages in drug delivery. Their large surface to volume ratio can be used for asymmet- ric optimization of various targeting ligands. They also be made of separate compartments for incorporation of imaging agents to enable real-time tracking of treatment. Since they have complex geometries, they can prevent initial contact with macrophages, allowing them to evade fast clearance by the reticuloendothelial system [7]; hence, JNPs can exhibit a desired pharmacokinet- ics, body distribution and pharmacodynamics. Therefore, due to its features and amphiphilicity properties, JNPs can act as mul- tifunctional carriers, making them a promising tool in the ﬁeld of drug delivery. Recently, many researches were conducted on the delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) [7,8], 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [9], paclitaxel [8,10], and curcumin [7] by JNPs. Moreover, these new nanoparticles can be used as ¨theranostic carriers” to concur- rently diagnose and treat diseases. Although this can be achieved by a homogenous nanoparticle, it is difﬁcult for two main reasons: First, sometimes drugs and diagnostic agents have different solu- bility; hence, the homogenous nanoparticles are not suitable for encapsulating both payloads. Second, mixing payloads with dif- ferent physiochemical properties might cause complexity of the released proﬁle [11–14]. In this review, we introduced an overview of JNPs, discussed their synthesis methods, and went over the recent JNPs syn- thesis publications as well as their applications with focus on drug delivery, bioimaging, especially theranostics for the ﬁrst time. 2. Janus nannoparticles’s common synthesis methods Numerous synthetic methods have been reported for the preparation of Janus particles, such as Pickering emulsions, self- assembly, phase separation techniques, controlled nucleation and growth processes, microﬂuidic devices [15–18], and electro- hydrodynamic jetting (EHD co-jetting) [19,20]. Two important points should be addressed when preparing Janus particles: ﬁrst, the ability to control the geometry, surface potential and surface chemistry of the particles, second the ability to generate JNPs in large quantities, which is required for technological applications [21]. Considering these two points, JNPs synthesis can be classiﬁed into three strategies, including masking, phase separation and self- assembly using various techniques such as EHD co-jetting systems, surface modiﬁcation, Pickering emulsion, etc. [5]. (Fig. 2). 2.1. Masking method Masking is the ﬁrst strategy to prepare JNPs. In this method, at ﬁrst homogeneous nanoparticles are synthesized. Then, using a masking agent, one side is covered so that the other side can be exposed to chemical modiﬁcations. Finally, after by remov- ing the masking agent, JNPs are released. In this way, patchy or more dumbbell-like JNPs can be manufactured, depending on the growth of the second component on the homogeneous nanopar- ticles that can be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) [5]. Lattuada et al. presented a masking technique to pre- pare stable dispersions of JNPs in water [22]. First, negatively charged poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-coated magnetite nanoparticles (10 nm) were adsorbed onto the surfaces of positively charged treated silica beads (700 nm). Then, the exposed surfaces of (PAA)- coated magnetite nanoparticles were modiﬁed with polystyrene sodium sulfonate (PSSNa) or polydimethylamino ethylmethacry- late (PDMAEMA). Attaching polymers to the outer surfaces of these adsorbed nanoparticles give them some properties, which is differ- ent from the original (PAA)-coating magnetite nanoparticles. When the pH was increased, the positive charge of silica surface changed to negative charge and a repulsion force was created, causing JNPs (20 nm) to be released from the silica surface [22]. In another study, Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. used the concept of protecting groups for the synthesis of Au–silica Janus stars. They used citrate-capped spherical gold particle as a core, which one half was covered with a silica semi-shell, and the other was cov- ered with gold spicks [23]. First, a ligand couple 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA)–PAA self-assembled over the metallic surface in a 2-propanol: water mixture. Then, the exposed gold surface was stabilized by PAA. After that by means of the well-known Stober method, silica semi-shell was formed only on top of the 4-MBA- capped area. Next, Au spikes were grown using a surfactant-free approach. Subsequently, the SiO2 semi-shell acted as a hard mask by protecting the gold surface against the further growth of Au spikes. This conﬁguration allows us to use plasmonic properties of gold nanostars as well as a diversity of chemical functionalization on the silica compartment within single particle [23]. According to masking strategy, another promising method for synthesizing JNPs using homogeneous nanoparticles is the Pick- ering emulsion method [24–26]. Pickering emulsion is composed of two immiscible liquids, stabilized by solid particles instead of surfactant molecules [27–30]. Solid particles in the range of nanometers to micrometers are adhered to the surface of the droplets and by forming a mechanically tough monolayer at the interface of two liquids that stabilize the emulsion droplets against coalescence. Indeed, the solid particles act as surfactant and can be organic particles, e.g., polymer latex or inorganic particles, e.g., silica and clay particles. After Pickering stabilization, the supra colloidal structures are obtained, which is called colloidosomes [24]. Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S. Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 3 Fig. 2. Synthesis Strategies of JNPs. For JNPs synthesis through oil in water (o/w) Pickering emul- sion, homogeneous nanoparticles are used as solid particles and dispersed in a melted wax, then mixed with water. Nanoparticles are located in the interface of two liquids so that one part is located in the melted wax phase while, the other hemisphere is exposed to continuous water phase. Next, the system is cooled to room temperature and particles are locked at frozen wax-aqueous sur- face. Therefore, particle rotation is prevented and the subsequent chemical modiﬁcation on the aqueous side of the emulsion inter- face facilitated. By dissolving wax in organic solvent, the resulting particles can be further chemically modiﬁed. After the chemical modiﬁcation amphiphilic JNPs can be obtained by dissolving wax in organic solvent. Recently, published articles mentioned that this method was one of the controllable ways to prepare JNPs in a wide range of size, functionality and large quantities [31–34]. Mendez-Gonzalez et al. reported a simple method to pro- duce multi-responsive JNPs of Fe3O4@SiO2 core@shell NPs using a Pickering emulsion-based approach [35]. Brieﬂy, in this study, Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was physisorbed on the surface of freshly synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles in order to reduce their inherent hydrophilic character. They used these nanoparticles as emulsion stabilizers, which permitted to create a close packed arrangement of particles at the emulsion interface. Their exposed surfaces were selectively modiﬁed with a vinyl derivate molecule, that permitted to the initiation of sequential polymerization of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) and poly(vinylimidazole) that allowed to obtain multi-responsive JNPs [35] (Fig. 3). In another study, Pickering emulsion technique was employed to fabricate JNPs with dual protein functionalization with the pro- teins ferritin and streptavidin [36]. In this regard, homogeneous silica nanoparticles (SiNPs), were modiﬁed with azidosilane on their surfaces and applied as surfactants to prepare Pickering emul- sion. After adsorption of SiNPs at the surfaces of emulsion droplets of molten wax, it was cooled to room temperature. Upon solid- iﬁcation of the Pickering emulsion droplets, the exposed face of the nanoparticle was functionalized with silanization with biotin- polyethylene glycol ethoxy silane (biotin-PEG silane). Then, the wax cores were dissolved in cyclohexane and the SiJNPs with azide, and biotin groups on their respective sides were released. The azide-functionalized side was grafted to ferritin via a click-reaction and the biotinated side was conjugated with streptavidin, and labeled with gold nanoparticles. Eventually, silica JNPs functional- ized with dual ferritin and streptavidin proteins were obtained. This research showed that this method can be used to prepare silica JNPs functionalized with a wide variety of proteins [36] (Fig. 4). In addi- tion to this examples, Pickering emulsion technique was employed widely to fabricate inorganic JNPs. Silica JNPs [31,33] and magnetic JNPs [32] are other examples that were synthesized via this method. In a novel synthesis method based on masking strategy, metallic Janus silica nanoparticles were fabricated via supercritical carbon dioxide (sc CO2) embedding technique [37]. When a polymer was embedded to sc CO2, the mobility of polymer chains enhanced, especially those near the surface. This led to glass transition tem- perature and elastic modulus to be reduced and the glassy state of polymer transited to the rubbery state in which impurity extrac- tion and polymer impregnation occurred. In this work, polystyrene microspheres (PS) were used as masking agents and nanosized silica particles used as a matrix of Janus particles. Plasticizing the PS substrate in sc CO2, allowed the hard SiO2 nanoparticles to be embed in the PS surface. The degree of particles embed- ment into the PS template in sc CO2 was controlled by adjusting sc CO2 conditions, such as pressure, temperature, and treatment times. The embedding degree was increased in lower pressure, higher temperature and increased treatment time. Subsequently, partially exposed SiO2 surface was modiﬁed by labelling it with gold nanoparticles and when dissolving PS in solvents (such as THF and DMF) or burning, Au-SiO2 spherical JNPs were obtained [37]. 4 Z.

Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) co-jetting. With this method Fe3O4-silica JNPs, PS-coated and both PAA-and PS-coated silica JNPs were also prepared [38] (Fig. 5). 2.2. Phase separation and microﬂuidic method The second strategy to synthesis JNPs is called phase separation. In this method, two or more incompatible substances are mixed and then separated into their own domains, using a simple tech- nique such as solvent evaporation, while still are a part of single nanoparticle [39]. This method involves the production of JNPs from two inorganic and two organic substances [40–43]. There- fore, this method requires a precise knowledge of physicochemical properties of the used materials, such as molecular weights, viscos- ity, interfacial activity, incompatibility of the two components, and etc. [6,44]. The control of polymer solution such as concentration, viscosity, and conductivity can result in a diverse range of sizes and shapes in the nanometer and micron range [45]. In this method, EHD co-jetting, microﬂuidic channels with T or Y junctions, continuous ﬂow lithography and ﬂuidic nanoprecip- itation system (FNPS) are experimental devices that can be used [2,46]. Their principle is the same: use of two or more ﬂows that run through parallel capillary needles in a side-by-side conﬁgura- tion, laminar condition and the break-up of the two parallel liquids. These experimental devices provide a wide range of anisotropic particle systems with unique characteristics [45]. It is important that a stable interface between the two jetting solutions are estab- lished during jet fragmentation, size reduction, and no convective mixing occurs (Fig. 6). Fernandez-Rodriguez et al. used polymethylmethacrylate and polytertbutylmethacrylate as polymers incorporated into JNPs by EHD co-jetting [47]. Their results revealed that both solution and process parameters such as dielectric constant and charge of surfactant have to be controlled to achieve a particular compart- mentalization, shape and size. In order to reduce the size of particles to nanoscale, they increased the dielectric constant of the jetted material and employed a charged surfactant to change the solu- tion characteristics. In addition, EHD co-jetting can be affected by a number of environmental factors, such as temperature, pressure and humidity. Consequently, altering these variables might lead to signiﬁcant variations in particle size, shape, surface, morphology, and porosity [47]. Bicompartmental polymeric JNPs with pH-dependent degrad- able compartments were another example, prepared by EHD co-jetting [48]. One hemisphere was made of an interpenetrat- ing polymer network (IPN) of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (p(AAm- co -AA)) and the other half composed of a crosslinked copolymer of dextran and (p(AAm- co -AA)). After co-jetting, the two polymer solutions containing PEO/P(AAm-co-AA) and dextran/ P(AAm-co-AA), bicompartmental JNPs were obtained. Then JNPs were thermal crosslinked to form chemical bonds (imide vs. ester bonds) in each hemisphere that had different degradation rates at physiological pH value. Therefore, only IPN hemisphere of JNPs constituting ester bond was degraded at physiological pH value within 5 days while the other one contain- ing imide bonds was stable. In contrast, both compartments were stable at pH 3, suggesting that these JNPs could be a good candidate for oral drug delivery. In another study, Xie et al. designed ﬂuidic nanoprecipitation system (FNPS) to fabricate JNPs comprised of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLG) [8]. The FNPs is comprised of a pair of inlet channels (feeding different polymer solutions) which are perpendicular to a dispersing channel. The inlet channels are arranged in side-by- side geometry and adjoin each other just prior to their entry to the dispersing stream. At the junction between inlet and dispers- ing channels, polymer solutions make contact and precipitates to a highly uniform particle with an equal volume of each polymer. Another strategy based on phase separation is surface nucle- ation that can be used to generate JNPs. Surface nucleation is a kind of hetero-epitaxial growth in which a certain crystallographic relationship exists between the orientations of substrate and the depositing material. Based on surface nucleation, dumbbell-like JNPs can be obtained by sequential anisotropic growth of a second component on the preformed seeds [49,50]. In this method, homogeneous nanoparticle of the ﬁrst compo- nent are synthesized and act as seeds. When the second component is added, the homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucle- ation occur concurrently. The homogeneous nucleation can lead to the formation of separate nanoparticles of the second compo- nent in the bulk medium while heterogeneous nucleation lead to growth on the second component on one side of the ﬁrst compo- nent. Therefore, it is important that the heterogeneous nucleation is promoted while the homogeneous nucleation is suppressed. Two critical points that has to be controlled in order to obtain JNPs instead of core-shell structures, are tuning the seed-to-precursor ratio and controlling the concentration of the second component so that it is below the homogeneous nucleation threshold during the synthesis process. Following classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation, deposit surface (the preformed seeds) acts as minimum-energy templates and aligns depositing material into a unique crystallographic ori- entation. Therefore, interfacial energy is another important factor for hetero-epitaxial growth of anisotropic second component on the preformed seeds surface. The interfacial energy at the inter- face between second components on the preformed seeds must be negative, as given for epitaxial growth [51]. By changing inter- facial energy, Zhang et al. synthesized Au-Poly Acrilic (PAA) JNPs instead of core-shell structure, and observed that increasing the ratio of water to isopropyl alcohol resulted in decreasing interfa- cial energy and Au-PAA JNPs were obtained [52]. Furthermore, the size of preformed seeds of the ﬁrst component, concentration of stabilizer, type of surfactant and monomers/seed weight ratio are other important factors in this approach that affect the ﬁnal JNPs morphology. As mentioned above, one important factor in surface nucle- ation method that affect JNPs shape, is the preformed seeds size of the ﬁrst component. Landon et al. synthesized eccentric spherical polystyrene-silica JNPs by adding carboxylated polystyrene parti- cles (cPS) as cores to silica sol-gel reaction [53]. They investigated the role of core size on the JNPs’ shape, and stated that when the PS core size was much larger than the silica part, numerous bumps of silica was formed on the core surface until the shell became com- 6 Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S. Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 Fig. 7. cPS−silica Janus particles are formed when carboxylated polystyrene particles are added to a silica sol−gel reaction. ¨Reprinted with permission of ref. [53]. Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society ¨. plete. However, when the cPS core size was about the same as b-SiO sphere, multiple silica bumps was formed on a single core; hence, a raspberry-like structure was formed. When cPS core size was smaller than the non-cPS silica (b-SiO) sphere, partially encapsu- lated Janus particles were formed [53] (Fig. 7). In another research conducted by this group, these JNPs were used as template for syn- thesis of nano-bowl-like structures (Janus template without the polystyrene core) [54]. To obtain nano-bowl-like structures, the polystyrene core of JNPs was removed by an organic solvent [54]. Zhao et al. reported a simple approach for the synthesis of eccentric Au-SiO2 Janus nanostructure through surface nucleation by treating citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles, using different amounts of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) molecules [55]. A criti- cal point for the formation of these Janus nanostructures was the concentration of PVP in this system, since PVP molecules had two important functions. First, these molecules stabilized gold nanopar- ticles and prevented their aggregation and second, PVP molecules acted as the nucleation site for the deposition of silica shell. In adequate concentration of PVP, concentric Au@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles could be obtained while by reducing the concen- tration of PVP to a certain range, eccentric Au-SiO2 JNPs could be prepared [55]. By using surface nucleation concept, another research group synthesized worm-like JNPs with controlled aspect ratio in which magnetic nanoparticles were applied as seed and the growth mesoporous silica structure on one side of the seed led to worm-like Janus structure with different aspect ratio [56]. In most researches, inorganic JNPs are synthesized using surface nucleation approach. Recently, Fallahi-Sambaran et al. syn- thesized poly(acrylic acid/ 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PAA/PDMAEMA) composite particles with diff ;erent morpholo- gies by combining distillation precipitation polymerization (DPP) and seeded emulsion polymerization [57]. In the aforementioned research, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA)-crosslinked PAA particles were ﬁrst synthesized via DPP approach and then these particles were used as seeds in emulsion polymerization of DMAEMA. It was found that monomers/seed weight ratio, type of surfactant, and amount of shell crosslinker were three important factors on the particles morphology. Therefore, depending on type of polymer constituting JNPs, these factors should be adjusted to obtain Janus structure instead of core-shell structure [57]. 2.3. Self-assembly method This method can be used to prepare polymeric JNPs from di- block and tri-block copolymers [58–60]. In this strategy, generally dumbbell-like JNPs can be obtained by changing the Janus balance, i.e., the relative volume of hydrophilic block to volume of hydropho- bic block in the block copolymer. Janus balance is simply adjusted by regulating hydrophilic or hydrophobic blocks chain lengths. In the self-assembly method, Di-block or tri-block copolymers are used as precursor that have great afﬁnity to self-assembly into unique objects such as micellar structures. In this method, the ﬁrst prerequisite to form JNPs is the presence of a core. The core can be a block of copolymer that is non-soluble in an appropriate solvent (core block). To obtain JNPs, generally block copolymers are dis- solved in non-solvent for the core block that leads to the assembly of micellar structure. After cross-linking of the core block to sta- bilize it, the bulk phase of copolymer is re-dissolved in a suitable solvent to rearrange the micellar structure to Janus structure [5]. Pham et al. reported a synthesis method of nano-sized oblate to dumbbell shaped polymeric JNPs, using RAFT mediated emul- sion polymerization [58]. The particles consist of two halves of diff ;erent surface properties and/or diff ;erent polymer composi- tions. In this study, micelles were ﬁrst formed from the amphiphilic poly(styrene)-block-poly (acrylic acid) di-blocks in the presence of styrene monomer. Then, these micelles were polymerized to form cross-linked polymer particles in the presence of potassium per- sulfate as an initiator via RAFT mediated emulsion polymerization. During heating for polymerization, some of the swelling styrene monomers are expelled and subsequently polymerized to form a bulge on the side of the original cross-linked seed particle, and then further polymerized to form JNPs. It was shown that the sur- face active properties of these JNPs can be used as stabilizers and inﬂuence particle formation in a surfactant free ab-initio emulsion polymerization [58] (Fig. 8). Zhang et al. designed a method to fabricate well-deﬁned polymeric JNPs with diff ;erent morphologies by step-wise self-assembly of the precursor [60]. At ﬁrst, they synthesized poly(tertbutylmethacrylate)-block-poly(2-(cinnamoyloxy) ethyl methacrylate) block-poly (2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)s (PtBMA-bPCEMA-b-PDMAEMAs) tri-block-copolymer, as precur- sor via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Followed by selective modiﬁcation of the chain length of the hydrophilic block of the precursor (middle block, PCEMA), they adjusted Janus balance and investigated its inﬂuence on the ﬁnal JNPs structure. PtBMA-bPCEMA-b-PDMAEMAs was ﬁrst dispersed in isopropanol as a nonsolvent for the PCEMA and then dialyzed against water as a nonsolvent for both PtBMA and PCEMA to initiate self-assembling into compartmentalized nanostructures. These compartmentalized nanostructures were permanently ﬁxed by selective UV crosslinking of the PCEMA domains and then were re-dispersed in a suitable solvent for all blocks such as THF, and then JNPs were formed. Four types of well-deﬁned JNPs were obtained by dis-assembly of the UV-crosslinked compartmental- ized nanostructures. It was found that by increasing the Janus balance, JNPs’ shape was changed from snowman-like to spherical. Shape-memory polymers (SMPs) are a class of polymeric stimuli-responsive materials with the ability to change their shape Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S.

Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 network that can be triggered with a sudden negative pressure. The amphipathic multiarm SU-PCL was ﬁrst fabricated via ring- opening polymerization (ROP) of \u0002-caprolactone in which sucrose acted as the initiator. SU-PCL assembled to nanoparticles with micelle structure via microemulsion method. During micelle for- mation, hydroxyl groups of sucrose were towered the outside and the hydrophobic PCL segments were gathered in the core. PCL seg- ment was then cross-linked using benzophenone (BP) under UV. As THF was used in preparing microemulsion, a certain amount of it was encapsulated in the PCL central segments of the particle. When the surrounding environment pressure became far below the pressure at the nanoparticles’ core, THF was volatilized vig- orously across the hydrophilic surface of the nanospheres. It was observed that spherical cross-linked SU-PCL nanoparticles changed their shape into SMJNPs with “jellyﬁsh”-like morphology (tem- porary shape) when a sudden negative pressure was applied by freezing. Therefore, THF encapsulation in the nanoparticles was a key in fabricating Janus-shaped nanoparticles from micelle struc- tures. In addition, THF reduced the Tm of the cross-linked SU-PCL nanoparticles. Therefore, upon the movement of the THF molecules, the frozen PCL segments were able to transfer to their initial posi- tion, forming a hydrophobic compartment on the surface of the nanoparticle and SMJNPs were obtained. The shape memory eff ;ect of the SMJNPs was investigated during the recovery process by changing temperature. It was observed that SMJNPs shape ﬁrst changed to ellipsoidal shape (recovering shape) and then returned to the initial spherical shape (recovered shape) at a temperature above Tm. To investigate drug-loading behavior of SMJNPs, cis- Dichlorodiamineplatinum(II) (cis-DDP), a hydrophobic anticancer drug was selected as a drug model. The mapping images of Pt from cis-DDP loaded in nanoparticles indicated that the recovering shape delivered the drug while spherical shape stored the drug. Therefore, this study showed that JNPs with the shape memory property have the potential to be applied for stimuli-responsive drug delivery [62] (Fig. 9). In most of the research works that JNPs were synthesized through self-assembly strategy, block copolymers were used as the precursors. However, Tang et al. reported JNPs were self-assembled from an asymmetric Gemini surfactant with an amphiphilic carbonate group (–O−CO–O–) [63]. In this research a typical asymmetric Gemini surfactant was fabricated by replac- ing one of the polar heads with an amphiphilic group (carbonate group (–O−CO–O–)). Therefore, these new surfactant as asymmet- ric surfactant could form supramolecular assemblies in various shapes. They investigated the effect of molecular structure and concentration of surfactant on the formation of supramolecular assemblies and reported that at lower concentrations (3.5 mmol L−1) t amphiphilic group belonged to the hydrophobic tail; thus, spherical micelles were formed. In addition, at higher concentra- tions some amphiphilic group became the auxiliary hydrophilic heads, distributed outside the micelle surface, where Janus struc- turer with two compartments was obtained. They also observed that amphiphilic group was essential to the Janus structure for- mation. These results indicated that the mechanism of the JNPs formation from asymmetric surfactant was different from the mechanism of JNPs self-assembled from polymers. In addition, compared to a surfactant molecule, JNPs showed a higher tissue penetration, since amphiphilic carbonate head outside the com- partment could enhance the tissue permeability of the whole JNPs [63]. In this review we discussed the most common strategies that lead to synthesis of nanoscale Janus particle and compred them in Table 1. On the other hand, there are many publications that have introduced other methods, which has led to the production of micro Janus particles [17,18,64–67]. Another possible approach to fabricate JNPs is the sputtering method which allows the fabrication of JNPs with one side modiﬁ- cation. This technique is a ubiquitous deposition technique usually applied for the preparation of thin ﬁlm, partially or fully coated metallic particles. In this approach, homogeneous nanoparticles, such as silica or metallic nanoparticles in uniform size are spread on a Si wafer to form a monolayer that are subsequently coated with evaporated metal [68,69]. In one study, sputtering method was applied to prepare 2D gold nanoparticles/graphene hybrids in which gold NPs were deposited in one side to form a Janus structure [70]. Recently, sputtering with subsequent in-ﬂight annealing were employed to produce dumbbell-like bi-metallic JNPs [71–73]. During sputtering, when the plasma gas was rapidly condensed, nanoparticles were formed. Thus, if nanoparticles are composed of immiscible elements, and are consequently metastable, using further in-ﬂight annealing can lead to element segregation in the particle to form distinct compart- ments. These studies present signiﬁcant progress toward achieving controlled synthesis of the bi-metallic JNPs with diff ;erent ele- mental compositions and structures. However, this approach is usually employed to fabricate bi-metallic JNPs for nano and micro- motor applications, but bi-metallic JNPs have biosafety concerns that should be resolved before being used as drug delivery carriers. As can be seen in Table 1, size, morphology and shape of the JNPs are affected by the synthesis method. Masking strategies such as Pickering emulsion lead to patchy JNPs while the other methods lead to compartment JNPs. Dumbbell-like and eccentric JNPs are obtained from surface nucleation and spherical JNPs with two dis- tinct compartment fabricated via phase separation strategies such as EHD co-jetting. In Pickering emulsion technique, it is essential that homogeneous nanoparticles were prepared beforehand to act as solid surfactant for stabilizing emulsion droplets. Therefore, this technique is limited to inorganic JNPs preparation while phase sep- aration technique such as FNPS, EHD-cojeting and self-assembly provide polymeric JNPs. However, all the mentioned methods have some limitations, and in each method there are several important factors that should be controlled for JNPs production. As presented in Table 2, depending on the synthesis method, polymeric, inorganic and organic/inorganic hybrid JNPs can be obtained. Due to the soft nature of the polymer chains and their controllable physicochemical properties, polymeric JNPs have attracted much attention and shown potential applications as col- loidal surfactants, chemical and biological sensors, drug delivery carriers and controlled release systems. Self-assembly, phase sep- aration and microﬂuidic-based strategies are the most prevalent methods for polymeric JNPs fabrication [74,75]. Compared with the polymeric JNPs, inorganic JNPs are of par- ticular interest because of their region-selective functionalization. Inorganic JNPs have attracted much attention in the ﬁelds of bio-imaging, targeted drug delivery systems, and theranostics. Fab- rication of polymeric/ inorganic hybrid JNPs is also investigated in literature [52,76]. Combining polymeric and inorganic materi- als within a hybrid JNPs can enhance the surface functionalization of the JNPs, their biocompatibility, and physical stability. 3. JNPs’ applications and achievements in drug delivery systems JNPs have some novel and special properties due to their dual functionality and anisotropic nature. Therefore, numerous appli- cations theoretically and experimentally were reported recently. They have been used as microprobes or sensors [77,78], micromo- tors [52,79], nanocorals [80], catalyst [55,81–85], solid surfactant and stabilizers in emulsions [47,59,86], etc. An important appli- cation of these nanoparticles is their usage in biological sciences, Z.

Due to the site-selective modiﬁcation of JNPs, each side can be used for the special purpose that allow combining different agents within a single particle with- out any interactions. Thus, JNPs appear as a new generation of the multifunctional carrier in DDS and theranostics. Herein, the application of JNPs in the ﬁeld of drug delivery will be discussed. As it was mentioned earlier, JNPs are composed of two diff ;erent sides with different composition, therefore they can be used for encapsulating more than one drug with opposite solubility. Tomassone et al. synthesized polymer-lipid JNPs using water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion solvent evaporation tech- nique for co-delivery of DOX and curcumin by inhalation [7]. The JNPs composed of PLGA and Precirol ATO 5 with ice cream cone shape (a longer, cone-shaped tail bound to a spherical polymer head). The size of JNP was 155 ± 10 nm and 450 ± 23 nm and the average surface charge was -15.22 ± 1.78 mV. By applying fewer shearing force during emulsiﬁcation, larger emulsion droplets and ultimately larger JNPs were obtained. It was found that larger JNPs accumulated in the lungs much more than smaller JNPs; hence, they selected JNPs with the size of 450 nm for further treatment of mice with orthotopic lung cancer. They also showed that the anticancer effects of treatment with two anticancer drugs, with different aque- ous solubility and mechanisms of action is more than the effect of only one drug loaded in similar nanoparticles alone [7] (Fig. 10). In another study, Janus polymeric nanoparticles comprised of PLGA, which was fabricated using a FNPS system [8]. These spher- ical JNPs composed of two compartment in which one was made of PLA/PGA 75:25, capable of carrying a hydrophobic drug (pacli- taxel) and the other one made of PLA/PGA 50:50, capable of carrying a hydrophilic drug (DOX) in a single particle. They compared the in vitro drug release proﬁles of JNPs with monophasic particles and emphasized that using these two compartmental JNPs as a drug car- rier, can avoid the interference of drugs when mixed in the same carrier [8]. Janus silica nanocomposites is another example of multi- functional nanocarrier, used for dual-drug delivery. These Janus nanocomposites composed of UCNP@SiO2@mSiO2&PMO (UCNP = upconversion nanoparticle = NaGdF4: Yb, Tm@NaGdF4, mSiO2 = mesoporous silica, PMO = periodic mesoporous organosilica). They contained core@shell@shell structured UCNP@SiO2@mSiO2 nanospheres, and PMO single-crystal nanocubes that were synthesized via anisotropic island nucleation and growth approach [10]. Owning to the dual independent domains of hydrophilic composites (UCNP@SiO2@mSiO2) and hydrophobic component of PMO with different pore size (2.1 nm and 3.5 ∼ 5.5 nm), these Janus nanocomposites acted as a nanocar- rier for loading two drugs with opposite solubility (hydrophobic paclitaxel and hydrophilic DOX were selected as model drugs). Janus nanocomposites were further modiﬁed with 1-tetradecanol (heat sensitive) molecules on the outer surface of the entire Janus nanoparticles and azobenzene (Azo)(UV/Vis light sensi- tive) in the radial mesopore channels of the core@shell@shell UCNP@SiO2@mSiO domains. The near-infrared (NIR) to ultra- violet/visible (UV/Vis) optical properties of UCNPs core and heat/light-sensitive properties of 1-tetradecanol and Azo as cap- ping agents made Janus nanocomposites to be applied for heat and NIR light bimodal triggered dual-drugs release. 1-tetradecanol was solid at below its melting point, which blocked the passing of encapsulated species completely. While raising temperature to its melting point (38 ∼ 39 ◦C), 1-tetradecanol melted and allowed the release of encapsulated species in the hydrophobic PMO crystal domains (drug1). Azo molecules can transform from the trans-isomer into the cis-isomer under UV irradiation (∼ 360 nm) and in contrast, the cis-isomer can transform into the trans-isomer under irradiation of visible light (∼ 450 nm).

Azo molecules immedi- ately absorbed emitted photons and created rotation-inversion movement continuously. Indeed, Azo molecule as a molecular impeller propelled the release of encapsulated species (drug 2) in mesopore channels of Janus nanocomposite. Evaluation of UCNP@SiO2@mSiO2&PMO Janus nanocomposite in HeLa cell line showed that the cancer cell killing efﬁciency was higher (more than 50 %) than that of single triggered drugs delivery system (∼25 %) [10] (Fig. 11). As it was mentioned, due to their anisotropic nature, Janus nanostructures can be used as a promising carrier in combi- nation therapy. Various shaped (e.g. rods, spheres, and plates) Au@PMO composite Janus nanostructures were synthesized by Hu et al. based on a seed-shape growth mechanism. In this study, the PMO shape was determined by the shape of Au nanoparti- cles [87]. Rod-like Janus Au@PMO nanostructures were selected to be used for cancer chemo-photothermal combination ther- apy since Au nanorods have excellent photothermal effect and the PMO part has a high surface area and porous nanostructures with ordered pores for effective drug delivery. The cytotoxicity of the chemo-photothermal combination therapy of AuNR@PMO- PEG/DOX against 4T1 murine breast cancer cells was compared with chemotherapy alone and photothermal therapy (PTT) alone of AuNR@PMO-PEG/DOX. The results showed that the combination therapy had more therapeutic efﬁcacy than chemotherapy and PTT alone. Multifunctional Janus nanocomposites, characterized by a body of mesoporous silica and a head of magnetic Fe3O4 called “nano- bullets” (M-mSiO2) were synthesized by Shao et al. [88]. M- mSiO2 nano-bullets were then functionalized with −COOH via the post- grafting method aiming for pH-responsive DOX release. The surface Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S.

It was noted that the satura- tion magnetization of Janus M- mSiO2 was higher than core-shell M- mSiO2. The cellular uptake M- mSiO2-PEG in the absence and presence of a magnetic ﬁeld was compared. It was reported that magnetic ﬁeld-enhanced endocytosis of M- mSiO2-PEG and induced a higher cellular uptake in tumor cells compared to normal cells. They also showed that magnetic DOX-loaded nano-bullets (M- mSiO2-DOX) selectively inhibited cancer cell growth, espe- cially in the magnetic ﬁeld environment in vitro. M- mSiO2-DOX effectively inhibits the growth of H22 liver tumors in situ. Further- more, Janus nano-bullets in vivo study in the transplanted tumor liver model in nude mice showed that magnetic ﬁeld increased efﬁcacy and selectivity in tumor inhibition and these particles inhibited tumor growth and reduced systemic toxicity. Stimuli-responsive nanomaterials have attracted much atten- tion as drug delivery carriers; however, the release of multi-drugs from a carrier is highly challenging. Moreover, compared with other nano-systems with uniform surface structure, multifunctional JNPs can assemble multiple components in a single delivery system with the aim of multimodal imaging and combined therapy of two or more drugs. Magnetic mesoporous silica Janus nanoparticles (Fe3O4-mSiO2 JNPs) composed of Fe3O4 head and mSiO2 body, were devel- oped for magnetic targeting and drug delivery (Berberine as drug model) [89]. The mSiO2 surface compartment was functional- ized with carboxyl groups as pH-sensitive groups to develop a tumor microenvironment-responsive nanocarrier. Fe3O4-mSiO2 JNPs showed good superparamagnetic properties and higher mag- netization saturation value than core-shell nanoparticles with the same magnetic core. Therefore, an external magnetic ﬁeld could improve the anti-tumor activity of Berberine-loaded Fe3O4-mSiO2 JNPs due to enhanced internalization. It was reported that Fe3O4- mSiO2 JNPs showed higher speciﬁcity for hepatocellular carcinoma cells rather than normal liver cells, due to the pH-responsive berberine release [87]. Asymmetric JNPs composed of opposing mSiO2 and Au faces, were developed for real-time monitoring intracellular dual-drug stimuli-responsive release [9]. This system monitored dual-drug stimuli-responsive release based on ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The face of JNPs that composed of mSiO2 was functionalized with 7- hydroxycoumarin-3-carboxylate (CMR) as a FRET donor. This face was conjugated with DOX as a FRET acceptor through Hydrazone as a pH-responsive linker. The other face of JNPs composed of 12 Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S.

Au, conjugated with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by redox- respon- sive gold-thiol bond. As the JNPs entered into tumor cells, the hydrazone bond was broken in an acidic environment and the DOX was released. Substituted gold-thiol bond with glutathione (GSH) was overexpressed in cancer cells led to the release of 6 M P. The cell experiments showed that DOX and 6 M P dual-drug responsive release could be real-time monitored within living cells. DOX release was monitored by detecting FRET signals changes of CMR/DOX with confocal microscopy, and 6-MP release was mon- itored by decreasing SERS intensity of 6 M P in Raman combined dark-ﬁeld microscopy. The anticancer effect of the dual drug loaded JNP was enhanced in comparison with single drug loaded JNPs. Recently, Zhang et al. developed a novel unidentiﬁed ﬂying object (UFO)-like Janus nanostructure which provided the required functionalities and compositions for dual-drug delivery, pH/ NIR stimuli-responsive release and synergistic chemo-photothermal cancer therapy in NIR-II biowindow [76]. The JNPs structure con- sisted of a 2D PdNS coated with a PAA hemisphere in which the PAA side was used for further modiﬁcation. In continua- tion, they ﬁrst fabricated palladium nanosheet / polyacrylic acid (PdNS/PAA) JNPs via coating of PAA preferentially on one ﬂat surface of 2D PdNS. Afterward, Zeolitic imidazolate framework- 8 (ZIF-8) was selectively grown on the JNPs PAA side and the other exposed PdNS side was modiﬁed with the mono(6-mercapto- 6-deoxy)-beta-cyclodextrin (CD); hence, UFO-like CD-PdNS/ZIF-8 JNPs were ﬁnally obtained. In this system, the CD-PdNS part of JNPs provided a suitable domain for hydrophobic drug loading (10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)). Furthermore, high bulk melt- ing point and broad NIR absorption band of PdNS not only caused NIR-II stimuli drug release from this domain but also caused UFO- like CD-PdNS/ZIF-8 JNPs to demonstrate the effective ability for hyperthermia therapy in NIR-II biowindow. ON the other hand, the PAA-ZIF-8 side was used for hydrophilic drug loading (DOX) in which pH-sensitive property of ZIF-8 and PAA induced pH- responsive drug release. Treating three cell line groups (HepG-2, A549, and MCF-7) with UFO-like CD-PdNS/ZIF-8 JNPs at different concentrations, revealed the good biocompatibility of these JNPs. Moreover, the hemolysis experiment conﬁrmed the cytocompati- bility and safety of UFO-like CD-PdNS/ZIF-8 JNPs. The cell viability analysis revealed the synergistic effect of dual-drug chemotherapy and NIR-II photothermal therapy. In vivo dual-drug chemotherapy combined with photothermal therapy in NIR-II biowindow was evaluated in the H-22 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice, and the results indicated UFO-like CD-PdNS/ZIF-8 JNPs could deliver both drugs to tumor sites and induced the synergistic chemo-photothermal therapeutic effect [76] (Fig. 12). One of the most important goals in chemotherapy is to develop targeted nanocarriers with the ability to deliver anti-cancer drugs, speciﬁcally to affected tissues. These targeted systems increased therapeutic efﬁcacy and reduced adverse effects. Lopez et al. developed Janus mesoporous silica nanoparticles that were asym- metrically functionalized with two targeting moieties via Pickering emulsions [90]. In order to achieve a sequential cellular to organelle targeting, one side of JNPs was selectively decorated with folate membrane cell receptors (folic acid) and the other side was decorated with mitochondria membrane (triphenylphos- Z.

The obtained results indicated that the enhancement of uptake in tumoral cells and the localization of the nanocarrier close to mitochondria improved the efﬁcacy of the transported drug. Zhang et al. synthesized octopus-type PEG-Au-Poly Acrilic acid /mSiO2-lactobionic acid JNPs for synergistic active-targeted and chemo-photothermal therapy [52]. First, they synthesized uniform Au@poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) JNPs by phase separation methods. Then, they used these JNPs as a template to synthesize octopus-type JNPs (OJNPs). For this purpose, they preferentially coated meso- porous silica (mSiO2) shell on the PAA side and selectively grew Au branches on the Au side. The surface of mSiO2 was modiﬁed with PEG to improve their stability and biocompatibility and con- jugated to lactobionic acid (LA), speciﬁcally to target hepatocytes or hepatoma cells bearing asialoglycoprotein receptors. After that DOX was loaded into the PEG-OJNP-LA JNPs and DOX release was pH and NIR dual responsive. The pH- responsive was caused by the protonation of the pH-dependent polymer PAA, and the NIR- responsive was caused by the remote heating produced by the photothermal conversion of Au. PEG-OJNP-LA JNPs showed pH and NIR dual responsive release properties as well as higher toxicity at both cellular and animal studies in comparison with chemotherapy or PTT alone (Fig. 13). All the discussed drug delivery applications of JNPs are summa- rized in Table 3. These studies indicate that research on the use of JNPs in drug delivery is on the rise rapidly. The main applica- tions of JNPs in the ﬁeld of drug delivery include co-delivery of two drugs with opposite solubility, chemo-photothermal combi- nation therapy, stimuli-responsive and real-time monitoring dual drug release, active targeting delivery, theranostics, bioiamaging, and enzyme-controlled stimuli-responsive drug delivery. 4. Applications and achievements in theranostics Due to their anisotropic surface properties and various function- alities, JNPs have attracted great interest for cancer theranostics. As it was mentioned, the site-selective modiﬁcation of each face of JNPs can be applied for a special purpose that allows the com- bination of different agents within a single particle without any interactions. This intrinsic characteristic causes JNPs to be used mostly in theranostics. In addition, JNPs are being used as the multimodal molecular imaging system (a combination of differ- ent imaging techniques), bypassing the intrinsic limitations of each individual imaging modality while maximizing its advantages. Au/Fe3O4@C JNPs were designed for actively targeted chemo- photothermal therapy and dual-modal imaging of cancer cells by Zhang et al. [91]. Au/PAA JNPs were ﬁrst synthesized by the phase separation method. Subsequently, by hydrolysis of FeCl2 to the small Fe(OH)3 nanoparticles preferentially in the PAA side, Au/Fe(OH)3-PAA JNPs were obtained. Then, the whole JNPs were coated by SiO2 and the Au/Fe3O4@C JNPs were acquired after cal- cination and etching. The size of JNPs were about 120 nm with mesoporous structure on the carbon side, using DOX loading. The Au side of JNPs was selectively functionalized with HS-PEG-NH2 to anchor folic acid (FA) as the target agent. In addition, these JNPs had high contrast for computed tomography (CT) imaging duo to their Au domain. They were also used as PTT agents and magnetic res- onance imaging (MRI) contrast agents duo to their Fe3O4 domain. Furthermore, JNPs drug release was pH/NIR-responsive, attributed to the remote heat generated from Au side of JNPs through pho- tothermal conversion. All in all, these multifunctional JNPs had competent loading capacity of anticancer drug with pH/NIR dual- responsive release, photothermal effect, actively targeting and high contrast for MRI and CT imaging (Fig. 14). PEG-CuS-Au-MnO2 ternary JNPs as multifunctional theranostic agents were synthesized by Li et al. via selective growth strat- egy [92]. Ternary JNPs possessed two spherical compartments in which one hemispherical was made of mesoporous MnO2 and the other was made of Au core covered with CuS shell. Further- more, to improve the stability and biocompatibility, the obtained ternary JNPs were further functionalized with poly (ethylene gly- col) thiol (PEG-SH). The mesoporous MnO2 domain acted as a MRI contrast agent and hydrophobic drug carrier. Meanwhile, the Au domain was used for CT imaging. Moreover, due to absorption in the NIR-II window and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupling effect of the Au core and CuS domain, the PEG-CuS-Au- MnO2 ternary JNPs showed to have hyperthermia effect, which could ablate tumors in deep tissue. Hence, the results revealed that PEG-CuS-Au MnO2 ternary JNPs not only had chemo-photothermal antitumor efﬁcacy but also showed effective CT/MR imaging capa- bilities (Fig. 15). Recently, Zhang et al. explored amphiphilic JNPs for co-delivery of two drugs with diverse physicochemical properties to can- cer theranostics [76]. They synthesized poly(3-caprolactone)-gold nanocage/ferric hydroxide-poly(acrylic acid) (PCL-AuNC/Fe(OH)3- PAA) JNPs, using phase separation concept and surface modiﬁcation [76]. Then, they applied them to load hydrophobic (docetaxel) and hydrophilic (DOX) drugs in PCL-AuNC and Fe(OH)3-PAA domains, respectively. Duo to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNC, PCL-AuNC/Fe(OH)3-PAA JNPs were beneﬁcial for NIR stimuli-release, IR thermal imaging, and photothermal ablation. Since PAA is a pH-sensitive polymer and AuNC had LSPR, the 14 Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S. Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 Fig. 13.

[92] Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society¨. release of DOX and docetaxel was controlled by pH and NIR laser irradiation. Moreover, the combined effect of dual drug loaded PCL-AuNC/Fe(OH)3-PAA JNPs plus NIR laser was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that PCL-AuNC/Fe(OH) 3 -PAA JNPs were able to restrain tumor growth by integrating chemo- photothermal therapy. In addition, the high X-ray attenuation of Au element and T1 contrast effect Fe3+ of the PCL-AuNC/Fe(OH)3-PAA JNPs were applied for CT and MR imaging, respectively. Over- all, PCL-AuNC/Fe(OH)3-PAA JNPs were comprised of two distinct compartments with different functions, which provided a new approach in cancer therapy [76]. Ag- mSiO2 JNPs with a head of silver nanosphere and a body of mesoporous silica were fabricated as theranostic nanocarriers [93]. Owning to the mesoporous ordered structure of silica and surface plasmon resonance properties of Ag, these JNPs showed good drug- loading capacity and SERS activity, which can be used for target detection and traceable drug delivery. DOX-loaded Ag- mSiO2 JNPs selectively inhibited cancer cell growth, rather than human normal cells. These properties highlighted the potential of Janus Ag- mSiO2 JNPs as a theranostic carrier for efﬁcient cancer therapy. Gold nanorods- mesoporous silica (GNRs-mSiO2) JNPs were synthesized by Wang et al. [94]. GNRs-mSiO2 JNPs with advantages of mesoporous silica and GNRs simultaneously, demonstrated high loading capacity, low cytotoxicity, effective SERS signals to real- ize cellular imaging, and photothermal effect, which indicated that GNRs-mSiO2 JNPs could be a good candidate for theranostic system and combined photothermal-/chemo-cancer therapy. Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S. Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 17 In another research, Au-Fe2C JNPs were synthesized and used as multifunctional entities with triple-modal imaging-guided PTT for diagnosis and tumor treatment [95]. After Au-Fe2C JNP synthe- sis, their surface was conjugated to afﬁbody proteins (Z HER2:342) for mammary-cancer targeting. Owing to their broad absorp- tion band in the near-infrared region and magnetic properties, these JNPs showed good photothermal eff ;ects in vitro. They were also effective agents for triple-modal multispectral photoa- coustic tomography (MSOT)/MRI/CT imaging both in vitro and in vivo. Through MRI/MSOT imaging, it was also demonstrated that afﬁbody-conjugated Au-Fe2C JNPs penetrated deeply and accumu- lated in tumor cells more than non-targeting Au-Fe2C JNPs. Iqbal et al. applied surface nucleation concept to synthesize mul- tifunctional binary transition metal oxide Mn3O4-TiO2/ZnO/Fe3O4 oxide-based JNPs for cancer theranostic applications [96]. They showed that these multifunctional JNPs enhanced a T1-weighted MRI contrast and had good properties for photodynamic therapy; hence, they can be used as a good agent in cancer theranostics application. Magneto-plasmonic Janus vesicles (JVs) another example of JNPs that are applied for bimodal imaging of cancers [97]. Magneto- plasmonic JVs consisted of a hollow cavity and a membrane composed of magnetic NPs (MNPs), block copolymer (BCP) - treated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and free BCPs. The hybrid JVs were produced by co-assembling a mixture of amphiphilic BCP of polystyrene-b-poly (acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA), AuNPs grafted with polystyrene-b-poly (ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) on the surface and hydrophobic MNPs. Depending on the size and mass fraction of AuNPs and MNPs that were used in the co-assembly mixture, JVs acquired the spherical or hemispherical shape. Duo to ordering and dense packing of AuNPs and MNPs in the membrane, hemispher- ical JVs showed a stronger absorption in NIR and enhanced the transverse relaxation (T2) contrast effect. It was reported that the release of a payload from JVs could be triggered by NIR irradiation. Also, an external magnetic ﬁeld modulated the release rate of pay- load. Moreover, the JVs were applied as contrast agents for in vivo bimodal photoacoustic (PA) and MR imaging of tumors. It was found that when an external magnetic ﬁeld was employed, the JVs accu- mulation in the tumor was increased. Therefore, JVs demonstrated stronger signal approximately two to three times more than the control groups without a magnetic ﬁeld in the PA and MR imaging [97] (Fig. 16). In new research, Efremova et al. synthesized Fe3O4-Au hybrids via epitaxial growth of Fe3O4 on top of Au seeds. Subsequently, Fe3O4-Au hybrids surface was modiﬁed with 1,2-distearoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-carboxy-polyethyleneglycol (DSPE-PEG-COOH) as a polymeric shell [98]. After that Fe3O4 polymeric surface was used to load DOX as a hydrophobic anti- cancer drug and the Au surface was conjugated to Sulfo-Cyanine5 NHS ester derivative (Cy5) ﬂuorescent dye, allowing nanocarrier tracking. Further, drug carrier capabilities and release, stability, cell internalization and in vitro toxicity of functionalized Fe3O4-Au hybrids were checked in the 4T1 murine breast cancer cell lines. They also investigated in vivo NPs delivery to malignant tissues by intravenous injection of Fe3O4-Au hybrid -Cy5 to mice via imaging tumor microenvironment and showed Fe3O4-Au hybrids could accumulate in tumors via enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect). As compared to other kinds of Fe3O4-Au hybrids and commercial contrast agents, Fe3O4-Au hybrids showed higher T2 relaxivity for MRI both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, results indi- cated the potential application of Fe3O4-Au hybrids for modern theranostics [98] (Fig. 17). Sánchez et al. synthesized trimodal imaging JNPs by combining an Au nanoparticle face together with a Fe3O4-mSiO2 core@shell face [99]. Fe3O4 and Au constituting JNPs were used as contrast agents in MRI and CT imaging, respectively. Then each face with different chemical reactivity was modiﬁed. The silica face was func- tionalized with cyclic RGD (cRGD) as a targeting peptide for cancer detection and a ﬂuorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 647 Hydrazide) was anchoring on the Au face for optical imaging (OI). The trimodal molecular imaging potential of JNPs was evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo. The result showed good MRI/CT/OI contrast properties and cytocompatibility of these JNPs in vitro. Furthermore, the inter- action of JNPs with tumors was evaluated in mice models treated with these targeted JNPs. After intravenous injection of JNPs, three MRI/CT/OI imaging showed high uptake in the tumor periphery of the cRGD peptide mediated targeting JNPs [99]. Although these JNPs acted as a good platform with integrated imaging agent, they could also be equipped with therapeutic agent for targeted cancer theranostics (Fig. 18). As can be seen in Table 3, most researches have focused on ther- anostic and metal-mSiO2 JNPs with different morphology. These are the most multifunctional carriers that have been investigated for theranostics. A metal part of JNPs adds several functions to nanocarriers, such as imaging and photothermal effect and can be functionalized for targeting and drug loading [100–105]. Inside pores of silica part can act as a reservoir for drug loading, as well as, the silica surface can functionalize with different chemical groups which add more function to the system [106–108]. Further- more, metal part in Janus structure compared to the core@shell structures is not affected by silica coating and its inherent char- acteristics are not diminished. For example, it was reported that the presence of silica coating in the core/shell structures signiﬁ- cantly reduces the average coercive force in comparison with the Janus-like Fe2O3/SiO2 [109]. In addition to these part, conjugating a biodegradable polymer to these systems improve their biocompat- ibility and stability, which might reduce their cytotoxicity. Hence, these JNPs as a ﬂexible and powerful platform generate an advanced multifunctional nanocarrier for targeted cancer theranostics. 5. Other new applications and achievements Another application of JNPs is to use them as integrated sensing–actuating nanodevice for enzyme-controlled stimuli- responsive cargo delivery. In these systems, two different surfaces of JNPs provide an opportunity for placing the gating mechanism and an effector molecule in the same nanodevice, simultaneously. Au-mSiO2 JNPs was reported as a gated nan- odevice for acetylcholine(Ach)-triggered cargo delivery [110]. After synthesis Au-mSiO2 JNPs via Pickering emulsion, the Au face of JNPs was functionalized with acetylcholinesterase enzyme and the mesoporous silica face was modiﬁed with pH- responsive ß-cyclodextrin:benzimidazole inclusion complexes as a supramolecular caps. Tris(2,2-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II)chloride [Ru(bpy)3] Cl2 dye was loaded into mesoporous silica face of Au- mSiO2 JNPs. In the presence of Ach, acetylcholinesterase enzyme on the Au face hydrolyzed it to choline and acetic acid. Produc- ing acid induced a local decrease in pH; therefore, benzimidazole was protonation and ß-cyclodextrin:benzimidazole ensemble was ruptured and the cargo released. Indeed, Au face acted as an effec- tor and triggered cargo release in this system. It was reported that the capped Au-mSiO2 JNPs showed selective ACh-dependent cargo delivery in a biological complex medium (HeLa cells) [110] (Fig. 19). In another research, Au-mSiO2 JNPs were used in the same way, however, instead of acetylcholinesterase enzyme, two effectors, glucose oxidase and esterase enzymes were simultaneously immo- bilized on the Au face. DOX was loaded into mesoporous silica face and in this case, Glucose oxidase and esterase enzymes trig- gered DOX release in the presence of d-glucose and ethyl butyrate, respectively [111]. 18 Z.

Copyright 2018 Springer Nature. In another research, the mesoporous silica face of Au-mSiO2 JNPs was employed for controlled delivery of [Ru(bpy)3] Cl2 dye, which was grafted with the pH-sensitive gatekeeper (the alkyl amino deriv ative 3-(2-aminoethylamino) propyltrimethoxysi- lane). The Au surface was functionalized with the enzyme urease. In this case, as a proof of concept, the cargo was released when urea was in the medium. Catalytic decomposition of urea by the enzyme urease on the Au face caused pH increase and the pH-responsive gated ensembles on the pore outlets of the mSiO2 face were unpro- Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M.

In most researches that we reviewed, inorganic JNPs with eccentric structure contained two compartments with different compositions. However, Croissant et al. synthesized eccentric peri- odic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) JNPs that consisted of two compartments of a phenyleneethylene bridged (P-Et) PMO with different pore size. They used preformed para-phenylene-bridged PMO NPs as seed, and then by adding 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane in 1:2 proportion with 1,4-bis(triethoxysilyl)benzene, fabricated (P-Et) PMO Janus NPs. P-Et JNPs consisted of a spherical part that was grafted to a pod. Subsequently, the hydrophobicity of the pores was applied for the adsorption of cargos (DOX/dye) into PMO NPs. Results indicated a good loading capacity of (42 wt% of loaded car- gos) without leakage for a few weeks. Incubation of free DOX and both cargo-free and cargo-loaded p-P-Et PMO JNPs with PANC-1 cell line showed that free DOX was more effective. Indeed, p-P-Et PMO JNPs exhibited good loading capacity but could be used for only hydrophobic cargoes [113]. Micro- and nano-motors are micro- or nanoscale devices that are able to convert chemical or external energy into movement and force. As one of the most common motor systems, Janus micro- or nano-motors own unique asymmetric structures and integrate different functional materials onto two sides [114–116]. However, Janus motors could provide a novel concept to develop actively delivering drug carriers. For example, Xuan et al. fabri- cated self-propelled Janus nanomotor based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles and used it as a carrier for the delivery of model drug, DOX [68]. For this purpose, they ﬁrst synthesized meso- porous silica nanoparticles (65 nm) by a modiﬁed Stober method. Then, these nanoparticles were spread on a silicon slide to form a two-dimensional monolayer. Subsequently, by using a sputter coater, mSiO2 nanoparticles were coated with chromium (Cr), an adhesive layer, and platinum (Pt), a catalytic layer. After that, the silicon wafer was sonicated and, Janus mSiO2 nano-motors were released. This nanomotor propelled by decomposing hydrogen per- oxide to generate oxygen as a driving force. The surface of Janus mSiO2 nano-motors was also modiﬁed with an egg phosphatidyl- choline bilayer containing folic acid modiﬁed phospholipid as a targeting ligand. The results showed that in the same culture time and particle concentrations, more amount of Janus nanomotors entered the HeLa cells than mSiO2 nanoparticles in the culture medium containing 0.2 % H2O2. Nevertheless, using the perox- ide fuel is toxic to mammalian cellular functions; hence, it is necessary to develop biocompatible fuels or alternative powered methods. In another case, Hu et al. reported a developed Janus ammoniated-hollow mesoporous silica (A-HMS) nano-motors for heparin delivery [117]. They ﬁrst synthesized A-HMS nanoparti- cles, using template method and subsequent ammoniation process. Then, the heparin was loaded into A-HMS nanoparticles and plat- inum was coated on the partial surface of H-A-HMS nanoparticles by sputtering method to fabricate Janus H-A-HMS nano-motors. Pt side of Janus H-A-HMS nano-motor catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to form oxygen and water, and asymmet- ric motion of oxygen bubbles acts as a driving force of the Janus H-A-HMS nano-motors. The nano-motors had good blood compat- ibility, no cytotoxicity, high loading capacity and controlled release of heparin, and autonomous motion ability. However, as mentioned before, the peroxide fuel is toxic and not recommend in biomedical applications. Although, Janus nano-motors combine the biomedical properties with autonomous motion ability resulting in a multi- functional platform for drug delivery, more complementary in vitro and in vivo studies are required to proceed their biological applica- tion, and development of a biodegradable Janus nano-motor with efﬁcient motion in biological media, is still a challenge. Virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) are self-assembled nanoparti- cles, similar to the original virus, but lack the viral genome. Due to their empty cavities, VLPs are good candidates for the encap- sulation of different cargos (drug molecules, imagery reagents, quantum dots, and other nanoparticles). In addition, VLPs as protein-based nanoparticles, showed an effective potential for biomedical applications owing to their versatility, biocompatibil- ity, safety, and ability to protect their cargo [118]. The new Janus Virus Nanomotors (JVNs) consisted of Brome mosaic virus (BMV) and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) capsids that were half- coated with catalytic platinum. The result showed half-covered VLP capsid were self-propelled in the aqueous hydrogen-peroxide medium due to the Pt side of the capsid that was catalytically decomposed by peroxide fuel. Both JVNs showed almost the same shape and hydrodynamic diameter (CCMV: 33.78 ± 1.27 nm, BMV: 20 Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S. Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 Fig. 19.

KGaA, Weinheim¨. 31.16 ± 0.72 nm). Nevertheless, they showed differences in buoy- ant density, sedimentation coefﬁcient, and diffusion coefﬁcient. JVNs and unmodiﬁed VLPs nanoparticles were loaded with the Tamoxifen and incubated with breast cancer cell line MDA-MB- 231. The results revealed the efﬁcient cell internalization of the virus nanomotors via endocytosis. In addition, in vitro monitoring of Tamoxifen release at different pH indicated that JVNs were sta- ble at neutral or alkaline pH, but leaked under mild acidic condition (pH ≤ 5.5). It is worthwhile to note that although this work was a proof of concept for the propelled virus-based Janus nanomo- tor, obviously no medical application could be expected using a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide [118]. Although, Janus nano-motors combine the biomedical properties with autonomous motion ability resulting in a multifunctional platform for drug delivery, more complementary in vitro and in vivo studies are required to produce their biologically application and development a biodegradable Janus nano-motor with efﬁcient motion in biolog- ical media are more challenging. Structural asymmetry of Janus particles can be applied in advanced multiplex biosensing applications [78]. For this reason, Peng Zhao et al. fabricated multifunctional dumbbell shaped Janus particles to monitor single-cell cytokine release through click reac- tion between tetrazine (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) [119]. To fabricate JNPs, ﬁrst big magnetic microspheres (bMS) carrying TCO were anchored to microwells of a microarray, and then other mag- netic microspheres carrying Tz were attached vertically to the bMS via Tz-TCO click reaction on a microchip under a magnetic ﬁeld. For particle functionalization, two sides of the particles were modiﬁed with diff ;erent antibodies to detect cytokine (anti-TNF\u0003 antibody) and cell capturing (anti-CD14 antibody). Then, Janus particles were labeled, using diff ;erent ﬂuorescent dyes and used for multiplex detection and analysis of the cytokines secreted by single live cells. The results exhibited the potential application of Janus particles for the simultaneous and sensitive detection of different cytokines secreted by individual macrophage cells (Fig. 20). Z.

In another example, magnetic mesoporous silica Janus nanorods were reported for foodborne bacterial enrichment and direct iden- tiﬁcation in milk samples [120]. This magnetic Janus nanorods containing Fe3O4 heads and mesoporous SiO2 bodies were fabricated using the sol-gel method. Fluorescent-dye doped meso- porous SiO2 bodies were further modiﬁed with antibodies to detect Escherichia coli while the magnetic heads were used for bacte- rial isolation. After the magnetic separation, complexes of the magnetic Janus nanorods and bacteria were analyzed via direct matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Hence, the ﬂuorescent-magnetic Janus nanorods can be suggested as a speciﬁc bacterial detec- tion and separation tool enabling bacterial identiﬁcation directly through MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. In order to achieve simultaneous multiplex detection by anisotropic Janus particles, more than two different immobiliza- tion approaches are needed to independently introduce multiple biological molecules on each compartment of particles without interaction. For this purpose, two compartmental polymeric Janus particles were synthesized by EHD co-jetting by Chan Woo Jung et al. [121]. Each compartment containing two different ﬂuores- cent dyes was then chemically conjugated with two different polyclonal antibodies (anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and anti-IgG pAbs). The particles were spatio-selectively bound to the respective monoclonal antibody (mAb)-immobilized substrate in opposite directions, depending on the presence of CEA or IgG as antigens (Ags). In the presence of antigens, a sandwich-type immunocomplex of pAbs-Ags-mAbs was formed as conﬁrmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Therefore, this study showed that the anisotropic Janus particles with directional binding capa- bility have great potential as a new class of multiplex biosensing systems. More recently, multi-target detection by Janus particles along with the optical properties of metallic ﬁlms was applied for optical immunosensing of diverse species. In this context, retroreﬂective Janus microparticles (RJPs) were fabricated by coating aluminum and gold layers sequentially on one hemispherical surface of the silica particles [122]. The aluminum layer acted as a retroreﬂec- tivity enhancer and as an intermediate adhesive layer for the deposition of gold, which was employed to enhance the spatio- selective modiﬁcation of RJPs with different antibodies, using the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) technique. In contrast to conventional optical probes, which require speciﬁc monochro- matic light, the RJPs reacted to polychromatic white light sources. The retroreﬂection signals from the antibody conjugated RJPs bounded to the target analytes in the immune-sensing zone were recognized as shining dots, and were counted using a dig- ital camera setup. In comparison with ﬂuorescence microscopy that requires objective lens with high magniﬁcation and ﬂuo- rescence ﬁlter unit for biomarker detection, these particles have indicated to offer alternative strategies in biosensing applica- tions. 6. Conclusion, main challenges and future perspectives JNPs have emerged as new anisotropic materials, which rep- resent a special class of particles that combine features and functionalities of different material in one single unit. Recently, masking, phase separation and button-up self-assembly are as the most common methods, which were reported for preparing these 22 Z. Rahiminezhad, A.M. Tamaddon, S. Borandeh et al. / Applied Materials Today 18 (2020) 100513 nanoparticles. For this purpose, various techniques are proposed such as EHD-cojetting systems, surface modiﬁcation, Pickering emulsion, etc. Each synthesis method has its own advantages and limitations, exhibiting that current synthetic methods are gen- erally sophisticated and might be appropriate for the needs of all JNPs with deﬁned size and morphology. Due to their mor- phological features, JNPs are promising candidates for high-tech applications in various ﬁelds ranging from material science to biology. Interestingly, they can be applied to drug delivery for different purposes, including encapsulation of dissimilar active agents, combination of different therapeutic approaches, real-time monitoring of drug release, drug targeting, and theranostic appli- cations. In recent studies, an increasing attention has been given to JNPs as sensing–actuating nanodevices for enzyme-controlled stimuli-responsive delivery, micro- or nano-motors, and multi- plexing biosensing applications that were reviewed in the previous section. Although JNPs are demonstrated as new materials with fascinat- ing properties in nano-biotechnology, there are major challenges that has to be addressed before they can be introduced in routine medical care. Despite numerous reports on JNPs’ synthetic meth- ods, one of the main challenges is choosing an appropriate method for the preparation and puriﬁcation of nano-sized JNP that can be employed in large-scale production processes. For this reason, it is essential to make further eff ;orts to develop easy fabrication tech- niques for attaining various high-quality JNPs in large scale. It is also necessary to ﬁnd a method that can easily generate biofunc- tionalized JNPs with high stability and adequate long-term storage in an eco-friendly and low-cost way. Another challenge that should be addressed, is to understand JNPs’ interaction with biological systems. In comparison with uni- form nanoparticles, JNPs with different surface chemistry offer more opportunities to combine unique features, but these particles also introduce more complex interactions than uniform nanopar- ticles. On the other hand, there is inadequate knowledge on how JNPs with both sensing and targeting compartments enter cells, as to whether these particles enter cells in a similar manner as uniform particles with only sensing or targeting functional- ity. Therefore, obtaining knowledge about biological responses to multi-functional JNPs will be critical for the rational design of JNPs as new multifunctional tools. Studies on JNPs application in drug delivery and theranostic applications are mainly focus on polymeric/inorganic hybrid par- ticles for achieving simultaneous high drug loading and diagnostic ability. While physical stability of these JNPs in biological media and their biosafety aspects are still challenging. Inorganic mate- rials such as silica and gold are the most used material in hybrid JNPs, which have not been approved by FDA for clinical usage, due to the biosafety concerns. Thus, more researches regarding JNPs’ biosafety, bio-distribution and toxicity are warranted to exploit hybrid JNPs in drug delivery systems in the future. In addition, some researchers have focused on only therapeutic properties of JNPs while others highlighted merely their potentials for imaging purposes. The beneﬁt of JNPs in combination therapy and syner- gistic action has not been appropriately addressed, but at the same time it is known that employing more than one treatment modal- ity might overcome the inherent limitations of a single treatment, leading to impressive therapeutic efﬁcacy. In summary, as far as we know given the large range of interest- ing JNPs’ capabilities, an easy scalable method to fabricate JNPs with deﬁned functionality, morphology, and narrow size distribution for biomedical applications does not exist. Therefore, complementary studies are required to provide more knowledge on JNPs synthesis for their proper use in drug delivery and theranostics in the future. Nevertheless, the exponential growth in number of publications on JNPs explicit and latent features, their practical applications in real-world systems are anticipated shortly.
