K. Mong 1,2, Atsushi Kubo 3, Chen-Bin Huang 4 & Hrvoje Petek 1,2 ✉ At the interface of classical and quantum physics, the Maxwell and Schrödinger equations describe how optical fields drive and control electronic phenomena to enable lightwave electronics at terahertz or petahertz frequencies and on ultrasmall scales 1–5. The electric field of light striking a metal interacts with electrons and generates light–matter quasiparticles, such as excitons 6 or plasmons 7, on an attosecond timescale. Here we create and image a quasiparticle of topological plasmonic spin texture in a structured silver film. The spin angular momentum components of linearly polarized light interacting with an Archimedean coupling structure with a designed geometric phase generate plasmonic waves with different orbital angular momenta. These plasmonic fields undergo spin–orbit interaction and their superposition generates an array of plasmonic vortices. Three of these vortices can form spin textures that carry non-trivial topological charge 8 resembling magnetic meron quasiparticles 9. These spin textures are localized within a half-wavelength of light, and exist on the timescale of the plasmonic field. We use ultrafast nonlinear coherent photoelectron microscopy to generate attosecond videos of the spatial evolution of the vortex fields; electromagnetic simulations and analytic theory confirm the presence of plasmonic meron quasiparticles. The quasiparticles form a chiral field, which breaks the time-reversal symmetry on a nanometre spatial scale and a 20-femtosecond timescale (the ‘nano-femto scale’). This transient creation of non-trivial spin angular momentum topology pertains to cosmological structure creation and topological phase transitions in quantum matter 10–12, and may transduce quantum information on the nano-femto scale 13,14. Classically, light propagates in the k-vector direction with transverse electric (EL) and magnetic (HL) fields oscillating at a frequency ωL, with a phase ϕ; the azimuthal direction and rotation of fields define the light’s polarization and spin angular momentum (SAM). Quantum mechani- cally, it is also a wave packet of photons, each carrying energy ħω (ħ is the reduced Planck constant), momentum ħk, and SAM quantum σħ (σ = ±1). When illuminating matter, the EL field interacts with electrons to induce dipole transitions generating light–matter quasiparticles such as excitons 6,15 and plasmons 7. The quasiparticles are defined by the properties of the field, the material dielectric response function, and the geometry of the interaction; on generation, quasiparticles can re-emit photons, decay into incoherent particles, or transform into other degrees of freedom16. Light interacting with matter can also create electromagnetic top- ological textures as self-localized wave packets. Skyrme proposed such quasiparticles to describe field textures in nucleons17. In mag- netic materials, the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya spin–spin interaction forms stable topological spin textures with integer (skyrmion) or half-integer (meron) charges 9,18; related textures occur in Bose–Einstein condensates, superconductors and ferroelectrics 19. A plasmonic ana- logue has been invoked, where fields acquire skyrmion-like textures, through interference20–22. Here, we create by spin–orbit interaction (SOI) of light, image by photoelectron microscopy, and describe by simulation and theory a new dynamical plasmonic quasiparticle where surface plasmon polari- tons (SPPs) take on a meron-like topological SAM texture. SPPs are chiral, evanescent, electromagnetic fields at metal/dielectric interfaces: according to the quantum spin Hall effect of light 23–25, as SPPs propagate in the direction of their k-vector, their electric field (ESPP) cycles into and out-of the surface plane, creating a transverse SAM pseudovector. Illuminating an Ag film (with a lithographically inscribed Archimedean spiral structure26 of defined geometric charge) with linearly polar- ized light generates SPP wave packets with orbital angular momenta (OAM) 27,28 that converge into a plasmonic vortex, where the SOI of light textures their SAM into meron-like quasiparticles (Fig. 1). We report how the OAM and SOI mould the plasmonic SAM 29 into nanoscale meron-like texture on a <20 fs timescale. This new quasiparticle of structured light transiently breaks the time-reversal symmetry, and can be applied to https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-3030-1 Received: 11 February 2019 Accepted: 2 October 2020 Published online: 23 December 2020 Check for updates 1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. 2Pittsburgh Quantum Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. 3Division of Physics, Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba-shi, Japan. 4Institute of Photonics Technologies, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. ✉e-mail: yad17@pitt.edu; petek@pitt.edu Nature | Vol 588 | 24/31 December 2020 | 617 dynamical studies of topological phase transitions 10–12 or in quantum information processing13,14. To reveal the quasiparticles in Fig. 1, we image SPP propagation (which occurs at a rate of 255 nm fs −1) and SOI leading to vortex forma- tion by recording a video of the spatial distribution of the coherent nonlinear two-photon photoemission (2PP) of electrons that is excited by the joint action of the optical and SPP fields: we do this by inter- ferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM; Fig. 2a) 28,30. Transmitting ultrafast light pulses through a Mach–Zehnder interferometer produces a pair of identical, pump and probe, light pulses, and scans their time delay to generate 2PP from the sample. The PEEM electron microscope images the emitted elec- trons with <10-nm spatial resolution as the pump–probe delay is advanced in steps of about 100 as. The 2PP signal is proportional to the integral ∫ xy zt t( ,,, )dT 4E of the total field at the sample, where ET(x, y, z, t) = EL(x, y, t) + ESPP(x, y, z, t) is the sum of the optical and the SPP field it creates (Extended Data Fig. 1); the PEEM thus records the space- and delay-time-evolving SPP and optical field interferences. By illuminating a symmetrized Archimedean coupling structure with a geometric charge of m = 2 (Fig. 2b) with y-linearly polarized, normally incident, λL = 550 nm light, the SPP waves emanate, undergo SOI, and form a plasmonic vortex at its centre. Figure 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2 reveal the SPP vortex in a static ITR-PEEM image. Scanning the pulse delay and acquiring microscopic images records a video of SPP fields gyrating about a phase singularity at the vortex core (Methods and Supplementary Video 1). Supplementary Video 1 records the dynamical field evolution, including the x–y plane interfer- ences of the tangential optical field and the SPP waves it creates that are modulated in delay time at ωL, as well as an unmodulated z component of ESPP that overlaps with and masks the dynamical vortex fields. The unmodulated signal is removed by Fourier-filtering Supplementary Video 1 to obtain Supplementary Video 2 (Methods). Fourier-filtered images i–v from Supplementary Video 2 shown in Fig. 2d reveal the vortex phase evolution (gyration) as the pump–probe delay is advanced by Δτ ≈ 0.9 fs (a phase delay of about π). The PEEM images SPP vortex fields that are generated by illuminat- ing the Archimedean structure. Our primary interest, however, is the SAM texture at the vortex, which we obtain by modelling the SOI of the SPP fields and their imaging by the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method; the simulated PEEM images (Fig. 2e) reproduce the fringe gyration. x z y Fig. 1 | The plasmonic meron SAM texture.

The Poynting or k-vector distribution in Fig. 3a shows the SPP energy under- going a clockwise circulation, for which the transverse SAM points into the vortex centre (Fig. 3b). Similar k-vector circulation occurs at y ≈ ±λSPP/2 from the main vortex. These three SPP field circulations occur because the linearly polarized excitation light is a superposition of right and left circularly polarized components, which carry SAM of σħ = ±ħ. The spin quantum number adds to the geometrical charge of the coupling structure to give OAM = m + σ. The superposition of SPPs with different OAM produces an array of vortices in the x–y plane, but only the main and the two side circulations along the y axis define the topological charge of the non-trivial SAM texture of the vortex system. The calculated in-plane ESPP field vectors in Fig. 3c show the clock- wise circulation at the vortex centre becoming linearly polarized as |y| increases before transitioning again to circular. These circulating ESPP fields, by Faraday’s law, generate a surface-normal H field, breaking the time-reversal symmetry and causing SAM to point in the positive z direction, as seen in Fig. 1. In vectorial optics, these polarizations are the circular C-point and the linear L-line singularities 31; they are stable structures over the pulse envelope that form through interference of the two component SPP fields of different OAMs. The real space L-lines can be projected to the equator of the Poincaré sphere of light polari- zation; they define the meron quasiparticle boundary where its SAM spans the Poincaré hemisphere. Thus, the L-line distributions define perimeters of domains of topological textures where the SAM align- ment passes through the x–y plane (white shading in Figs. 1 and 4a). We calculate the L-line map at the vortex and its time evolution (Meth- ods and Supplementary Video 3) from the ellipticity distribution of the ESPP(x,y) fields. The L-line map is a robust property of the SAM topology that locates where the z component of SAM passes through zero (Fig. 4b). The central C-point and its L-line periphery define the topological charge of SAM textures, as we show next. The topological charge of a SAM texture is a measure of its spin S, where SE EH H ω εμ= 1 2 Im(× +× ).

Nature | Vol 588 | 24/31 December 2020 | 619 D xy = 1 4π ′⋅ ∂′ ∂ × ∂′ ∂ .(2)      |S SS The areal integral of D gives the topological charge, Q, which is quan- tized in multiples of 1/2 for non-trivial distributions. Boundaries for such integrations are cardinal points (equators or poles) of Poincaré spheres. The calculated D we plot in Fig. 4c is bounded by L-lines, which are stable over the pulse envelope (Supplementary Video 4 and Sup- plementary Information) as verified in Fig. 4e. We calculate Q for different L-line domains as follows. The hourglass-shaped domain surrounding the central vortex, and the two side elliptical domains surrounding the side vortices, form the dumb-bell region marked by shading in Fig. 4c. For each of these domains we obtain Q = 1/2 corresponding to a meron-like SAM texture (Extended Data Fig. 6), where at one central C-point the SAM points up, and is in-plane at the L-line periphery, where it rotates by 2π along the circumference. All outer L-line domains beyond the central dumb-bell include two pairs of vortices of the opposite vorticity that form through the interference of SPP waves with OAM = m + σ, whose topological charge sums to Q = 0. As explained in detail in Supplementary Infor- mation, the dumb-bell domain defines the topological meron SAM texture of Q = 3/2 in Fig. 1. Our numerical simulation of the SPP fields identifies three meron-like SAM textures associated with the main and two side vortices that arise from SPP components with different OAM. An analytical model that describes the SOI of SPP fields by Bessel equations attributes the main and side meron textures to differences in the SAM, and therefore OAM, of the two components of the generating linearly polarized field (Sup- plementary Information and Methods). In Fig. 4e we verify the temporal stability of these SAM textures. Even though ESPP oscillates at the laser driving frequency, the topological charge is defined by OAM of the generating SPP fields, which is constant over the field envelopes; this analysis shows that excitation geometry dependent meron-like quasi- particles that break the time-reversal symmetry form with dimensions of about λL/2 on the timescale of the generating optical field. Although we cannot image the SPP SAM textures, we can confirm the SAM stability in Fig. 4d by extracting a related property, the plasmonic flow32, over >10 optical cycles (about 20 fs). The plasmonic flow reproduces the L-line map enclosing the triple meron SAM texture (Methods). Because diffraction does not limit the optical flow, we image SAM texture related properties with <50 nm spatial resolution. The generated quasiparticle enables nano-femto control of SAM topological textures in materials with topologically trivial band struc- tures with timescales and amplitudes defined by the optical field. Differ- ent choices of the coupling structure geometry and light polarization define the topological charge, and therefore whether the generated SAM texture is meron-like, skyrmion-like, or an array of interacting topological quasiparticles33. The quasiparticle field is sufficiently intense to drive the nonlinear 2PP that we detect. We note that vortices occur in optical speckle 13,31, and thus topological field polarization can emerge spontaneously—for example, to drive structure formation in the cosmological context 11,12. In optical applications, pulses of different durations, field strengths and polarizations, or with actively manipu- lated phase and amplitude, will enable the creation, manipulation and annihilation of plasmonic topological spin textures on femtosecond timescales. The generated quasiparticles can transfer their spin tex- tures to imprint topological properties on proximate quantum matter (such as Bose–Einstein condensates and superconductors), modulate spins of defect centres, and by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, drive gyroelectric34 effects—for example, the polarization rotation of optical fields35. The tailored SAM textures can interact with ballistic electrons at the Fermi level9 or with spin-valley degree-of-freedom materials36 to exchange energy, momentum and spin among them to enable optical switching and quantum state control on scales of a nanometre and a few femtoseconds.

A 100-nm-thick Ag film is thermally evaporated onto a Si substrate with a native oxide layer in a Plassys MEB550S electron beam evaporator. Subsequently, the SPP Archimedean coupling structure with a slit width and depth of ~100 nm is etched in an FEI Scios focused ion beam system. The SPP coupling structure is composed of Archimedean spiral ele- ments with a geometric charge of m = 2 that is created by evolution of its radius r upon rotation in the azimuthal angle φ as rr φ=+ mλ 0 2π SPP , such that its innermost radius r0 = 10.7 μm (19 × λSPP) increases by λSPP for a clockwise rotation of π (Fig. 2b)26. It is composed of triplicate coupling arcs such that the SPP field from each structure adds in-phase and is brought to a common vortex. The samples are transported through air and introduced into the PEEM ultrahigh-vacuum chamber without further processing; the exposure to air does not visibly affect the photoemission images. ITR-PEEM setup Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is a discriminating method for spectroscopic imaging of electronic properties and phenomena at vacuum/solid interfaces 37. Nano-femto imaging of coherent electro- magnetic phenomena is enabled by combining ultrafast laser pulse induced photoelectron emission, with photoelectron spatial imag- ing by electron optics 38,39. Photoelectrons that form PEEM images are emitted by coherent nonlinear absorption of two or more quanta of light (ħωL), as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. A single pulse, or a pair of phase-locked femtosecond laser pump–probe pulses, excite the sample for static PEEM and ITR-PEEM experiments, respectively. The coherent nonlinear two-photon absorption is induced by a coherent sum of the external optical and surface plasmon fields; the total field is temporally and spatially textured by their interference, as suggested in Extended Data Fig. 1. The PEEM electron optics collect, project and magnify pho- toelectrons at the focal plane of an image intensifier to record their spatial distribution with a CCD camera. The signal is integrated for ~10 5 excitation cycles to record the spatiotemporal interference between the excitation light and the SPP fields it creates. In a single-pulse PEEM experiment, only the self-interference occurs between the optical field and the SPP field it creates. In an ITR-PEEM experiment, however, the pump–probe phase delay causes an additional interference signal that enables imaging of the SPP field generation, propagation and decay. The electron microscope thus enables recording of nonlinear maps of the optically excited surface polarization fields with a resolution of ~10 nm (ref. 39). The escape depth of <10 eV photoelectrons relative to the Fermi level, EF, is a few nanometres, making the PEEM signal sensi- tive to the vacuum/Ag interface fields. A non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) laser sys- tem operating at a 1-MHz repetition rate produces the ultrafast (<20 fs) excitation light pulses at λL = 550 nm (2.25 eV). As depicted schematically in Extended Data Fig. 1, normally incident linearly polarized excitation optical light with a surface tangential electric field denoted as EL excites a coherent SPP field. A plane wave SPP has cyclically oscillating longitudinal (Elong) and transverse components (Ez) of electric field as it propagates (Extended Data Fig. 1). The Elong interferes with EL over the entire illuminated area, thereby creat- ing an interference pattern with SPP wavelength of λSPP = 530 nm that propagates as the pump–probe delay is advanced, as shown by the green curve in Extended Data Fig. 1 30,40. The Ez component of the SPP field, however, does not interfere with EL and consequently contributes a delay-independent photoemission signal. The PEEM videos (Supplementary Videos 1, 2) report the wavelength of the SPPs and how their fields propagate at the local (vacuum/Ag interface) speed of light39,41. To further illuminate the PEEM imaging, we show in Extended Data Fig. 2 a full field-of-view PEEM image produced by single-pulse excita- tion where the coupling structure launches the SPP waves with a tailored geometrical charge creating the intense 2PP signal at the vortex core; the logarithmic colour scale reveals both the side interferences near the Archimedean spiral coupling structure and at the plasmonic vortex at its centre. The interferences are generated by a single pulse, and thus are static; they do not include the dynamic, delay-dependent component. To interpret different processes that contribute to PEEM signals, two characteristic regions are labelled in Extended Data Fig. 2. The optical fields interacting with the coupling structure launch the SPP fields, which converge to a vortex at the centre. The y component of Elong inter- feres with the y-polarized EL field to produce the radial fringes with a λSPP period, like the contrast mechanism for SPPs in Extended Data Fig. 1. At the centre region, however, in addition to the EL–Elong interference, the counterpropagating SPP fields from all sides converge with a π-phase shift to form the vortex, which produces interferences with a λSPP/2 period 40. As shown analytically in the Supplementary Information, the π-phase shift from the coupling and the geometrical charge produces a C-point phase singularity at the vortex core where the amplitude of Ez is zero and its phase is undefined, while Elong circulates42. Extended analysis of ITR-PEEM ITR-PEEM employs a Mach–Zehnder interferometer to generate iden- tical pump–probe pulse pairs that interrogate the time dependence of coherent SPP flow in the sample39,43. Dynamical ITR-PEEM videos follow the coherent SPP phase evolution by recording images, such as in Extended Data Fig. 2, while scanning the pump–probe time delay in ~100-as steps. In addition to self-interferences30, such as in Extended Data Fig. 2, ITR-PEEM videos also record the coherent evolution of the pump–induced SPP fields by interfering them with a delayed probe pulse. The delay-time-dependent PEEM images are assembled into Supplementary Video 1, and its Fourier-filtered version, Supplementary Video 2. Extended Data Figure 3a plots the PEEM signal intensity at the pixel level for selected regions of the vortex (see the inset), and a reference interferometric autocorrelation of the laser pulse (measured in the same experiment by reporting an area and photoelectron energy integrated 2PP signal from a flat Ag region), as a function of the pump–probe delay time. Near 0-fs delay, all interferences oscillate at the driving laser frequency and phase, while for longer delays, they become position-dependent reflecting the local evolution of the y com- ponent of Elong, which contributes to the pump–probe interference. The phase-resolved time delay scanning enables us to extract a distribution of the relative phase between the position-dependent 2PP signal and the reference autocorrelation, which reflects the relative phase of the y component of Elong with respect to EL. An example of such mapping at ~45-fs delay is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3b. Further analysis of the coherent plasmon dynamics follows similar procedures developed for coherent photoelectron spectroscopy 44. In a coherent nonlinear 2PP measurement, the delay-time-dependent photoemission yield (Extended Data Fig.  3a) at each pixel can be analysed into harmonics, where the 0ωL component shows the phase-independent field envelope contribution from the self-interference such as in Extended Data Fig. 2, and the 1ωL and 2ωL components capture the phase-dependent coherences between pump- and probe-induced polarizations. Thus, we reveal the nano-femto vor- tex oscillation at the 1ωL frequency by Fourier-filtering the ITR-PEEM data. In this procedure, we Fourier-transform the data in Supplemen- tary Video 1 at every pixel, and then using a square function centred at 1ωL with a width of 1 eV (shaded box in Extended Data Fig. 3c) we select the delay-time-varying signal at the driving frequency, and finally perform inverse Fourier transform on it at the pixel level to obtain the spatiotemporal videos of the amplitude and phase of the orbiting y component of the Elong at the vortex core (Supplementary Video 2); contributions from the Ez and x component of Elong are largely elimi- nated because they contribute mostly to the 0ωL component as they do not interfere with EL. These components may contribute to the signal through cross-terms with the y component of the Elong, but such signal contributions are expected to be much weaker, as in surface nonlinear spectroscopy45. The 2PP intensity fringes in Fig. 2d show the absolute value of the position-dependent inverse Fourier transform of the 1ωL signal. In Extended Data Fig. 4 we show a series of images as the delay is advanced by 1/2 of the optical cycle, showing the corresponding raw PEEM data images of the vortex, its Fourier-filtered 0ωL component, and the real part of the 1ωL component, to illustrate the Fourier-filtering procedure that obtains the images in Fig. 2d. One can see the sense of the field orbiting at the vortex in the raw data (Extended Data Fig. 4a), but it is obscured by inclusion of all of the harmonics, where the 0ωL component dominates (Extended Data Fig. 4b). The Fourier-filtered data in Extended Data Fig. 4c show, however, the circulating amplitude evolution of the y component of the Elong field. SPP fields and polarization singularities Most previous studies of SPP vortices were generated by circularly polarized light, where coupling structures converted SAM into the OAM of the SPP field, which in turn formed a vortex 28,46. When illuminating the Archimedean spiral structure with linearly polarized light, however, its geometric charge defines only the OAM of SPP fields. In Extended Data Fig. 5, we show the calculated evolution of the Cartesian components of the SPP fields that form a vortex over one-half of an optical cycle at the centre of an Archimedean spiral structure of m = 2 illuminated with lin- early polarized light. It is evident that the SPP fields forming the vortex orbit clockwise according to the geometric charge. The amplitude of Ez is always zero at the centre, because of destructive interference; the x and y components, however, form the circularly polarized Elong field that is described in Extended Data Fig. 3c. The image in Fig. 2e is the calculated intensity produced by interference between the y compo- nent of the Elong field and the uniformly y-polarized optical probe field. The variation of the Elong between the L-line and C-point polarization singularities establishes the topological spin texture. The optical L-line and C-point polarization singularities stand for the limiting linear and circular polarizations; they are defined by Stokes parameters P0–3 PE E=+ || , (3a)xy0 22 PE E=− || , (3b)xy1 22 \u0000PE E=− 2Re( ),(3c)xy2 PE E=2Im(), (3d)xy3 \u0000 where Ex and Ey are components of Elong; the parameter P0 describes the field intensity, P1, the (x,y) polarization (1 for x and −1 for y), P2, the ±45° polarizations (1 for 45° and −1 for −45°), and P3, the circular polarization (1 and −1 for left and right circular, and 0 for linear). The Elong field var- ies profoundly on a nanometre scale, including regions of linear and circular polarizations. The regions of linear polarization (P3 → 0, and thus Sz = 0) are the L-line singularities; they form connected regions in space around points of circular polarization, or the C-point singularities (|P3| → 1, where Sz points normal to the plane of circular polarization). In the Supplementary Information and the extended SAM analysis in Methods, we show that L-line singularities bound the topologically non-trivial spin textures associated with C-points at vortex cores; together they define the plasmonic meron-like spin textures. L-line maps are calculated from 1/|P3| for the applied fields, where for linear polarization P3 → 0, therefore, 1/|P3| gives infinity, tracing regions of the polarization singularity31. The L-line distribution shown in Fig. 4a in the main text, however, is calculated by evaluating the ellipticity (the ratio between long and short axes of an ellipse) of the Elong polari- zation ellipses; these are obtained by tracing Elong during one optical cycle at the peak amplitude of the SPP pulse from FDTD simulation. The advantage of using the ellipticity rather than the actual fields, as in equation (3d), is that the vortex is stable over the pulse envelope, enabling determination of the time-averaged polarization ellipses, whereas the field amplitudes oscillate at 1ωL frequency. Extended analysis of the spin texture While the defined hourglass region at the vortex core encloses plas- monic spin texture resembling that of a magnetic meron, we extend the analysis of the spin texture to the entire system by decomposing it into individual domains, with boundaries defined by L-lines (the Sz = 0 condition) from the analytical model. In Extended Data Fig. 6a, we plot a 2 μm × 2 μm region surrounding the vortex and decompose it into different domains that are bounded by the Sz = 0 condition found in the L-line map. In addition to the stable meron-like texture at the core hourglass domain (white region), we find two additional domains (blue regions), each having a topological charge of 1/2. The L-lines defin- ing these domains enclose the phase singularities (black dots) of the two side-vortices, located at ±y ≈ (1/2)λSPP, that were introduced in the previous section. These three intertwining vortices establish the total topological charge of 3/2. Going further out from the three central domains (white + blue), which we refer to collectively as the dumb-bell region, the spin tex- ture acquires a regular periodic pattern that extends to infinity; these repeating domains, defined by the dashed lines in Extended Data Fig. 6a, acquire Θ (radial angle from the vortex core; Supplementary Fig. 1a) dependent boundaries with a period of ~λSPP along the y direction defined from the oscillatory behaviour of Bessel functions. Because these periodic modulations result from interferences between the two generating vortices, it is natural to analyse the domain topological prop- erties with the modulation period as the basic unit; this is analogous to magnetic skyrmion lattices where one defines the periodic bound- ary of a single skyrmion, which can be interpreted as a superposition of spin waves47. Proceeding, we find that the topological charge of the domain (yellow + white + blue) enclosed by the first apple-shaped L-line is 3/2, which indicates that the yellow domain in Extended Data Fig. 6a has zero contribution to the topological charge. In addition, the topological charge enclosed by the second apple L-line (outer dashed line in Extended Data Fig. 6a), and all the repeating ones, have the same topological charge of 3/2. This indicates that each toroidal domain bounded by the periodic apple-shaped L-lines adds zero contribution to the system topological charge. The reasons why these additional toroids contribute zero topological charge are twofold. First, from a spin texture perspective, within the yellow domain in Extended Data Fig. 6a, the spin textures associated with the two phase singularities along the x axis have the opposite vorticity to those along the y axis; the vorticity v is defined by Nagaosa et al. 9 as the winding direction of the in-plane spin. To illustrate this, we show the periodic spin textures (normalized Sz by colour map, and in-plane spin by arrows) in Extended Data Fig. 6b, for the same area as in Extended Data Fig. 6a, with L-lines overlapped to delimit the different domains. In addition, we zoom into the spin textures near the phase singularities along x and y directions in Extended Data Fig. 6c and d, respectively. We consider the spin texture vorticity v, which we find along the x direction to be v = +1 while along the y direction it is v = −1. Therefore, the topological charge of each of these outer domains, determined by summing up the vorticities9, is zero. To better visualize the spin texture, we transform Sz → −Sz in the domains having positive Sz (we transform the red areas in Extended Data Fig. 6c, d into blue), but conserving the topological charge of each domain; this is achieved by flipping the sign of the Sx and Sy in the blue areas in Extended Data Article Fig. 6c and d, respectively). We emphasize that such operation is per- formed only to help visualizing the in-plane texture while conserving the topological charge. The resulting spin textures after switching Sz, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 6e, f for the same area in Extended Data Fig. 6c, d, clearly have the opposite vorticity. Therefore, the pairs of spin textures on the x and y axes with the opposite vorticity contribute identically zero to the total topological charge. Second, the zero contribution from the toroidal domains to the total topological charge can be understood by cancellations of phase circulations associated with the phase singularities created by inter- ference between OAM = 1 and OAM = 3 generating-vortices. The first pair of phase singularities occurs on the y axis with no counterpart on the x axis, as already established. We plot the phase change (defined as the angle of Im(Ez)/Re(Ez)) of the three central phase singularities in Extended Data Fig. 7a by tracing the phase in a closed circle of 10-nm radius around each phase singularity. Clearly, they have the same circulation direction, with a phase jump from −π to +π. This is true for all vortices on the y axis. Thus, they define the three central meron-like textures with the same vorticity. The next set of phase singularities along the x and y axes came in pairs. The phase changes of the two sin- gularities shown in Extended Data Fig. 6c, d are plotted in Extended Data Fig. 7b. Unlike in Extended Data Fig. 7a, the observed phase circulation directions for all phase singularities on the x axis are the opposite of those on the y axis, as evident from the opposite phase jumps. There- fore, the opposite phase circulations associated with the singularities on the x axis and y axis result in cancellation of the vorticity and there- fore, the topological charge. As a result, only the primary vortex in the hourglass domain and the two effective side-vortices in the elliptical L-line domains contribute non-zero topological charge to the entire system. This can be attributed to the SOI in plasmonic vortices. Thus, we establish that a plasmonic vortex system generates a non-trivial spin texture topology through SOI of light. Specifically, the launching of SPP fields with a geometrical charge m = 2 generates a topological charge of 3/2. This complex texture in space can be decom- posed into a single meron-like texture at the core, with charge 1/2, and two intertwined side textures, contributing 1/2 integer charge each, also consistent with the meron texture. The multiple meron textures arise through superposition of separate plasmonic vortices of the left circularly polarized and right circularly polarized components of the incident light whose SOIs create uncompensated spin texture at its primary and two side-vortex cores. The generation of the meron topo- logical charge is a property of Bessel equations that describe the SPP field distributions and its SOI; increasing the geometrical charge of the coupling structure obtains a three meron texture independent of m. Analysis of the plasmonic flow The assignment of the generated quasiparticle to a meron spin tex- ture calls for its measurement; this requires knowledge of the spati- otemporal evolution of the SPP fields and its spin textures with deep sub-optical-wavelength spatial resolution. While the recorded PEEM videos do not give the field polarization or spin textures directly, analy- sis of the vortex fields by numerical methods such as the Horn–Schunck (HS) algorithm can confirm the formation of spin textures based on the gradient of intensity in image sequences; such analysis identifies the in-plane polarization regions of the SPP vortex fields from the optical image velocity vector distributions32,48. The connection between the velocity vectors from the plasmonic flow analysis and the polarizations of the SPP fields is twofold: first, both are in-plane vector fields; sec- ond, they share similar longitudinal character, that is, the longitudinal in-plane SPP fields and the velocity vectors are parallel with the kSPP. A large flow is associated with a longitudinal linearly polarized field orbiting around the core, which is parallel to the k-vector; similarly, small flow is associated with circularly polarized plasmon fields, whose k-vectors circulate rather than propagate. Because the image velocity distribution follows the vectorial electric field distribution, we can use the derived velocity vectors to extract the behaviour of the experimen- tally measured SPP electric fields. Specifically, by minimizing a global energy functional ∬FI II xy≈( ++ )d dxx yy tHS vv , where Ixy t,, are pixel-wise spatial and tem- poral derivatives of image intensity and vx,y are the target velocity vectors, the HS algorithm outputs a sequence of velocity distributions (vx, vy) representing the Elong from the Fourier-filtered data. Specifically, the image intensity, I, in our analysis is the photoemission signal from Fourier-filtered PEEM images normalized to the range of [0, 1], thus associated with the magnitude of the in-plane SPP fields. Applying the HS algorithm 49 to the sequence of the 1ωL PEEM images (Extended Data Fig. 4c), we determine the flow of the delay-time-dependent SPP fields, that is, the plasmonic orbiting flow. Because the large optical flow velocities are associated with the linear polarization of SPP fields, calculating the optical flow produces an experimental image of the L-line map of SPP fields. We note that the experimental images represent a quartic power of the electric fields, while the L-line maps record regions of linear SPP polarization, from where the signal is strong. Although these quantities are related, they are not equivalent. Extended Data Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the experimental L-line maps at several delay times. Here, the delay inter- vals are reported in units of the optical cycle time: when the pump– probe delay time is set to zero, the first cycle corresponds to a delay time of 0 to ~1.83 fs (the period of the excitation light), and the Nth cycle corresponds to a time window of [N − 1, N] × 1.83 fs. In Extended Data Fig. 8, three stages are shown: (1) before the vortex formation, in which case the probe pulse arrives before the pump-induced SPPs travel to the core (pump–probe delay <~10 cycles, or ~18.3 fs); (2) dur- ing the vortex existence (22, 28 and 34 cycles, or ~40.3 fs, 50.2 fs and 62.2 fs); and (3) when the vortex dissolves (45 cycles, ~82.4 fs). Each image is obtained for signal period of one cycle. For stages (1) and (3), the L-line maps are invisible because the pattern of vortex orbital motion (and therefore the flow vectors) is not established or has dis- solved. In stage (2), one sees that a distinct L-line map is developed once the vortex becomes established after ~22 optical cycles, and it dissolves after 45 cycles when the SPP field amplitudes decay. This timescale agrees with the propagating dynamics of the SPPs: it takes the SPP wave ~40 fs to travel (at a group velocity of ~0.85c; c is the speed of light in vacuum) from the coupling structure to the centre of the spiral (r0 = 19λSPP). The approximate L-line distribution image obtained from the exper- imental PEEM images is stable and reproduced for over ~10 cycles. The main text Fig. 4d gives the optical flow that is averaged over 10 cycles during the maximum of the vortex persistence. This experi- mental image of the L-line structure locates the quasiparticle on a deep sub-wavelength spatial scale, and demonstrates its stability and per- sistence over multiple 1.83-fs period optical cycles extending through the pulse duration; this indicates the stability of the SAM topological texture. We note that the optical flow contrast has an approximate width of 50 nm, which corresponds to two pixel widths of the recorded images. This is an upper limit of the available ITR-PEEM spatial resolu- tion, because the data acquisition for Supplementary Video 1 is not optimized to perform the optical flow analysis. Thus, the ITR-PEEM experiment is capable of measuring the SPP spin texture informa- tion on a deep subwavelength (<50 nm) spatial scale with sub-optical cycle (<2 fs) temporal resolution. The extremely high quality nonlinear photoemission imaging of the SPP vortex nano-femto field and spin dynamics by ITR-PEEM and the differential nature of determination of the optical flow benefit from the time resolution of light and the spatial resolution of electrons.

Article Extended Data Fig. 1 | Diagram of the nonlinear two-photon photoelectron emission process that forms the PEEM images. The recorded photoelectron count images are created by electrons absorbing two energy quanta (2ħωL) from the total electric fields at the surface, EL + Elong + Ez, exciting them above Evac (left). The light quanta can be supplied either from a single pulse, or from a coherent superposition of fields from a pump–probe pulse pair with a variable time delay; the PEEM records the spatial distribution of photoelectrons excited by the total field. Right, the superposition of EL (shown as solid (dotted) grey lines) with wavelength λL and the parallel (anti-parallel) Elong (the tangential component of the SPP field at the vacuum/Ag interface, which oscillates between the Ez and Elong character; the solid and dotted curved lines signify a change in the SPP field sign in the same sense as for EL) fields with wavelength λSPP creates the total in-plane field with a modulation period of λSPP, as shown by the green curve. The PEEM signal is integrated over many excitation cycles, so the experimental time resolution is encoded by how interferences evolve with the pump–probe delay.
