Keywords: organic materials; inorganic materials; organic/inorganic hybrid nanomaterials; bio-applications; nanomedicine; medical devices 1 1. Introduction Biomaterials based on polymers, ceramics, metals, and composites have a long history of use in biomedical applications for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of diseases [1]. Representative organic biomaterials are based on polymers. Various types of biocompatible polymers have been developed because of the characteristics of polymers with biocompatibility and biodegradability [2]. The use of polymer biomaterials in the drug delivery field has been especially remarkable, and several polymer-based drug delivery systems have already been approved for clinical use [3-5]. Inorganic materials such as glasses, ceramics, and minerals are also used for bio-applications. Inorganic materials have several advantages over organic materials, including their mechanical, thermal, optical, and magnetic properties, as well as their connected porous structures [6]. Although many biomaterials use organic and inorganic materials independently, the development of organic/inorganic hybrid materials has become necessary as the demand for highly functionalized biomaterials has increased. Organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites are generally defined as a mixture of organic and inorganic materials of submicron-scale dimensions [7]. For example, water non-dispersible inorganic nanoparticles [e.g., gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), carbon dots, etc.] can become dispersible in water by surface modification with organic polymers, and the resultant hybrid materials can be used as diagnostic or therapeutic agents [8, 9]. Thus, it is possible to develop new functional therapeutic agents that can be used for biomedical imaging by taking advantage of the optical or physical properties of the inorganic nanoparticles and are also capable of drug delivery via a surface polymer. In addition, polymer composites containing inorganic ceramic nanoparticles have strong mechanical properties, making them suitable for use as bone graft materials [10, 11]. 2 Based on the physicochemical properties of hybrid materials, organic/inorganic hybrid materials have attracted a deal of attention in the development of various pharmaceuticals and medical devices (e.g., drug delivery carriers, scaffolds for tissue engineering, vascular stents, and dental implants, etc.) (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Schematic representative of organic/inorganic hybrid materials: (a-b) Types and synthesis of representative organic/inorganic hybrid (a) nanoparticles [12-14] and (b) nanocomposites, and (c) Bio-applications of the organic/inorganic hybrid materials [15-20]. The nanoparticular hybrid materials can be applied to drug delivery, biomedical imaging, cancer immunotherapy, photomedicine, and gene editing, while the hybrid nanocomposites can be utilized to scaffolds for tissue engineering, vascular implants, and dental implants. The image is reproduced with permission from [12-20]. 3 Research on organic/inorganic hybrid materials in the biomedical engineering field has increased steadily over the past decade, as reflected by publishing trends during this period (Fig. 2). Previously, hybrid materials were studied in materials science or classical engineering, whereas more recently, research on organic/inorganic hybrid materials is being actively conducted in the field of biomedicine. Figure 2. Number of papers published in last decade on organic/inorganic hybrid materials (Source: PubMed; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, Keywords: hybrid materials, hybrid nanomaterials, hybrid nanoparticles, and hybrid nanocomposite). In this review, we classify recently developed organic/inorganic hybrid materials as nanoparticles and nanocomposites (bulk materials), summarize the most recently reported organic/inorganic hybrid materials, and describe their synthesis and structural characteristics. We then outline the use of hybrid nanomaterials in a variety of biomedical applications such as theranostics, cancer immunotherapy, photomedicine, photothermal therapy, gene editing, and signal transduction with physical stimuli. In particular, we review the use of organic/inorganic hybrid materials in cancer immunotherapy and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. 4 In addition, we describe recent applications of organic/inorganic hybrid materials to medical devices, including scaffolds for tissue engineering, vascular stents, and dental implants. We conclude with an overview of the challenges and future outlook for organic/inorganic hybrid materials in the context of biomedical applications. 2. Advanced organic/inorganic hybrid nanomaterials Organic/inorganic hybrid materials can be divided into two categories according to the binding force responsible for the interaction between their organic and inorganic components [21, 22]. Class 1 hybrid materials interact weakly through van der Waals, electrostatic, or hydrogen bonds between the organic and inorganic components. On the other hand, class 2 hybrid materials are held together by strong interactions, such as covalent or ionic-covalent bonds. The development of class 2 hybrid materials with stable and strong binding has advanced in recent years [6, 7]. Class 2 hybrid material containing covalent bonds can be used to synthesize completely new materials from functionalized alkoxides, minimize phase separation, and easily define organic–inorganic interfaces [6]. In this review, we will conceptually divide organic/inorganic hybrid materials into hybrid nanoparticles and nanocomposites (bulk materials). Hybrid nanoparticles are composed of nanoscale organic and inorganic materials, whereas nanocomposites are hybrid matrices consisting of organic and inorganic materials larger than the micron scale. These two types of organic/inorganic hybrids, nanoparticles and nanocomposites, can be further classified as class 1 and 2 depending on their bonding strength, which is in turn determined by the process by which they are synthesized. 2.1. Hybrid nanoparticles 5 In general, nanoparticles are defined as organic or inorganic materials 1–100 nm in size [23]. Nanoparticles provide useful opportunities to investigate changes in material properties as a function of particle size. In the metal category, Au, Ag, and Cu nanoparticles exhibit unique electronic, optical, and catalytic properties that vary according to their size [24]. The properties of these nanoparticles differ significantly from those of bulk metals or molecular compounds, and depend strongly on particle size, particle shape, inter-particle distance, and the nature of the organic shell, if any [24-26]. In order for inorganic nanoparticles to be used in bio- applications, it is crucial that they be dispersed in the aqueous phase. Nanoparticles should also be chemically stable and avoid degradative processes such as partial oxidation or sintering. Polymer stabilizers are widely used for metal nanoparticles because they allow the particles to disperse in the water phase while simultaneously improving their chemical stability. In addition, these organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles can improve the biocompatibility and processability of the original material, and the properties of the nanoparticles can be modified by the surface polymer. Hybrid nanoparticles not only have the characteristics of both inorganic and organic nanomaterials, but can also have unique properties that surpass those of the original components. Accordingly, hybrid nanoparticles can be harnessed in a variety of biomedical applications, including biomedical imaging, drug delivery, phototherapy, and image-guided therapy [27]. 2.2. Hybrid nanocomposites Organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites are generally defined as a mixture of organic and inorganic materials of nanoscale dimensions [7]. Hybrid nanocomposites can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous systems of organic and inorganic components. The domains of each organic or inorganic component range from a few angstroms to a few tens of nanometers. 6 Organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites are expected to be stronger than the sum of the two phases due to synergy between the component materials, as in the hybrid nanoparticles mentioned above. The properties of a hybrid nanocomposite are determined by the nature and contents of its organic and inorganic components. Prepared hybrid nanocomposites have better physicochemical properties than their individual components, especially in regard to mechanical and thermal stability. In addition, the interconnected porous networks and magnetic, electrical, redox, and chemical properties of hybrid nanocomposites can be modulated by their internal inorganic components. The internal porosity of hybrid nanocomposites is suitable for use as drug delivery vehicles. Moreover, because they can act as scaffolds for cell therapy, hybrid nanocomposites are also utilized for tissue regeneration. For example, porous hybrid nanocomposites encapsulating osteoinductive agents that promote differentiation of cells into bone have been utilized for tissue regeneration [28]. Functional hydrogels, including several types of organic and inorganic components, are also utilized for a wide range of bio- applications, such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. Organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites can be classified as matrix or hydrogel, as discussed in more detail below. 3. Synthesis of advanced hybrid nanomaterials In recent years, many researchers have sought to utilize the desirable biomedical properties of both inorganic and organic nanoparticles (Fig. 3). To expand the application of nanoparticles in various fields, the spacing and alignment of individual nanoparticles must be controlled to exploit their desirable properties. With this in mind, multiple synthetic methods, including surface modification, self-assembly, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), physical blending, and in situ deposition, have been developed to obtain desired physicochemical properties by altering the surface properties of nanoparticles and controlling their arrangement. Surface 7 modification, a simple method for overcoming surface incompatibility between nanoparticles and polar/non-polar solvent or polymer matrices, involves the introduction of small molecules or synthetic polymers into the nanoparticle surface. Figure 3. Schematic representative of organic and inorganic materials property comparison. The desirable characteristics of each materials are incorporated into various types of hybrid materials [13, 14, 29, 30]. The image is reproduced with permission from [13, 14, 29, 30]. This simple method not only enhances the dispersion of the nanoparticles in polymer matrices, but also enables further modification of the nanoparticles, thereby expanding their range of applications. In addition, various methods have been developed to obtain reinforced physicochemical properties by controlling the alignment of nanoparticles. Assembled nanoparticles can manifest intriguing characteristics or properties relative to the original forms. Therefore, a variety of hybrid nanoparticles have been developed using methods such as self- assembly and MOFs to control nanoparticle arrangements. Similarly, a method has been developed for fabricating nanocomposites using polymer matrices to improve their mechanical 8 and other properties. To obtain well-defined nanocomposites with desirable properties, nanoparticles must be stably dispersed within polymer matrices. Synthetic strategies for hybrid nanocomposites with high homogeneity can be classified into two major categories, physical and chemical. Physical methods include solution and melt blending, whereas chemical methods involve in situ deposition processes. The components for generating hybrid nanomaterials along with synthetic methods and type classifications of hybrid nanomaterials are listed in Table 1. Table 1.

Also, due to their high specific surface-to-volume ratio, inorganic nanoparticles are prone to form agglomerates/aggregates, resulting in fast clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [60]. To broaden the application of inorganic nanoparticles, it is necessary to modify their physicochemical properties by coating them with organic polymers, thereby improving their biocompatibility and prolonging their blood circulation time. In this section, we will summarize methods for hybridization of polymers and inorganic nanoparticles through surface modification and self-assembly. Furthermore, we will address MOF, which have recently received attention. 3.1.1 Surface modification The surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles can be modified by physical (adsorption) and chemical (grafting) methods. Physical modifications are achieved through surface adsorption or reaction with small molecules, whereas chemical modifications involve grafting polymeric molecules through chemical bonding to functional groups on the particles [61]. Silane coupling agents, the most common modifiers for inorganic nanoparticle surfaces, have bifunctional groups that can react with both phases, thereby forming a bridge between them [62]. The generic chemical structure of silane coupling agents is R-Si-(OR’)3. OR’ (R’ = alkoxy group: CH3O-, CH3CH2O-) 10 is an anchoring group that reacts with -OH groups on the metal oxide surface and forms a strong Si-O-M bond (M is the metal oxide) through a condensation reaction, whereas R is an alkyl bridge connecting the silicon atom and the organofunctionality [62]. Surface modification via silane coupling agents proceed by four steps: i) before utilization of silane coupling agents for inorganic surface modification, alkoxy groups must be hydrolyzed in the presence of water, thereby liberating the alcohols and generating reactive silanol groups; ii) during hydrolysis, self-condensation of silanols occurs, and silanol oligomers form; iii) the reactive silanol monomers or oligomers are physically adsorbed to hydroxy groups of metal oxides via hydrogen bonds on the metal oxide surfaces; and iv) finally, these hydrogen bonds are converted into covalent bonds by liberating water under heating, and the residual silanol groups on the metal oxide surface are condensed with each other [62]. Further surface modification can be achieved using the terminal functional groups of the silane coupling agent. For example, Osaka et al. developed a novel biosensor device for the influenza A viral HA proteins H1 and H5 protein using surface modification with silane coupling agents. In their approach, the surface of a field effect transistor (FET), a metal oxide semiconductor for detecting the surface potential change, was modified with an aminooxy-terminated silane coupling reagent, 3- aminooxypropyltriethoxysilane [63]. Then, two kinds of trisaccharide receptors terminating in 6′-sialyllactose and 3′-sialyllactose were conjugated directly with the aminooxy-terminated silane coupling agents. For example, Chen et al. developed silica coated nanoscintillator for the X-ray mediated photodynamic therapy [31]. SrAl2O4:Eu2+ (SAO) nanoparticles were coated with a solid silica layer by using both aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as silane precursors for the synthesis of nanoscintillators. The synthesized silica coated nanoscintillators have numerous amine groups on the surface, resulting positively charged surface. 11 Another approach to modifying the surface of inorganic nanoparticles is a chemical method. This method involves grafting of synthetic polymers to the substrate surface, which enhances the chemical functionality and alters the surface topology of the native inorganic nanoparticles [62]. Two chemical grafting methods have been reported. The first is the “grafting to” method, a convenient way to link end-functionalized polymers to the surface of a complementary functionalized inorganic nanoparticle. Despite its simplicity, the grafting approach typically results in low grafting density due to entropic limitations imposed on the reactivity of end- functionalized polymer chains [64, 65]. Higher grafting density can be achieved by surface- initiated controlled polymerization (the “grafting-from” method). This polymerization process, including radical, anionic, and cationic polymerization methods, involves propagation of the grafted polymers from the surface of the particle [62]. In the grafting-from method, the monomers are polymerized from the surface of the inorganic nanoparticle. Due to the low molecular weight of monomers, they can penetrate aggregated nanoparticles and react with activated sites on their surfaces. The thickness and especially the density of the polymer layer can be controlled by adjusting monomer feeding and polymerization time, ultimately yielding well-defined organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles [37]. Matyjaszewski et al. utilized a grafting-from method to graft poly(2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl acrylate) onto a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle surface, using 12-(2-bromoisobutyramido)dodecanoic acid as an atom- transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator [36]. 3.1.2 Self-assembly Just as nanoparticles exhibit properties that differ from those of the corresponding bulk materials, assembled nanoparticles can have collective properties distinct from those of individual nanoparticles and bulk material [66]. Self-assembly provides a simple approach to 12 controlling the inorganic nanoparticle assembles to improve or provide unique properties in a controllable manner [66, 67]. Self-assembly refers to the process by which nanoparticles or other discrete components spontaneously organize, either directly via specific interactions or indirectly through their environment [68]. Block copolymers with distinct ABA triblock chemical structures that provide well-defined interactions with nanoparticles play important roles in nanoparticle self-assembly. Block copolymers spontaneously self-assemble into ordered nanostructures via specific direct or indirect interactions, depending on the environment [68]. Self-assembly of a block copolymer is governed by the balance of various forces, including covalent or non-covalent bonding, coulombic attraction/repulsion, depletion forces or dipole–dipole interactions, and steric hindrance. However, hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) has the influence on self-assembly [67]. By controlling the HLB of the block copolymer, nanostructures such as spherical micelles, vesicles, and lamellae can be obtained [66-68]. Inorganic nanoparticles can be used as templates to promote self-assembly of the block copolymer, and can form multifunctional, bio- responsive nano-platforms by introducing additional functionalities to self-assembled nanostructures. In particular, magnetic nanoparticles combined through self-assembly of the block copolymer exhibit significantly higher r2 relaxivity than well-separated individual nanoparticles [65, 69, 70]. For example, Ling et al. reported tumor pH-sensitive magnetic hybrid nanoparticle (PMNs), self-assembled iron oxide nanoparticles (sub–5 nm in size) with stimuli-responsive block copolymer for use in theranostic applications [9]. PMNs showed enhanced T1 magnetic resonance (MR) imaging through the assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles. In addition, PMNs can selectively target tumors via surface-charge reversal triggered by the acidic tumor microenvironment. Also, PMNs exhibit pH-sensitive fluorescence imaging and photodynamic activity that can selectively kill cancer cells, resulting 13 in enhanced therapeutic efficacy. 3.1.3 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) The novel properties of nanoparticles as drug carriers, such as the ability to target specific disease region and protect drugs from degradation, have led to the commercialization of nanodrugs (Doxil, Abraxane, and Ambisome). However, the list of suitable drugs remains limited due to the low drug loading efficiency of nanoparticles (<5 wt.%) [71]. As an alternative, highly regular porous crystalline hybrid MOFs have emerged as a means to overcome the low drug loading efficiency of conventional nanocarriers. The high and regular porosity of MOFs, a function of their pore volumes and shell surface areas, increase their drug loading capacities [71]. MOFs are materials constructed by coordination bonds between metal-containing nodes and multidentate organic bridging ligands, resulting in high thermal and mechanical stability [72, 73]. Various functional materials, including metal nanoparticles, QDs, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and biomolecules, have been integrated into MOFs to form composite or hybrid materials [42]. MOFs have intriguing physical and chemical properties, including tailorable compositions and topological structures, high porosity, and larger Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surfaces than can be achieved with single-component nanostructures. Due to these desirable properties, MOFs have emerged as promising platforms for biomedicine [74]. Conventional techniques for MOF fabrication include the solution, diffusion, and hydrothermal methods [75]. The solution method involves mixing metal elements, organic ligands, and other additional materials at a particular ratio in a solvent, and then stirring for a specified time at fixed temperature. To purify the MOF crystals, the reaction products are 14 separated through filtration, and residual solvent is removed by evaporation. By contrast, diffusion methods are conducted under mild conditions with long reaction times, and can be further classified as gel, liquid, or gas diffusion. Gel diffusion is a method for forming MOF crystals inside a gel by mixing organic ligands dispersed in the gel with a metal ion solution for a certain period of time. In liquid-phase diffusion, the center metal ions and organic ligands are dissolved in an incompatible solvent and mixed to obtain MOF crystals on the contact surface. Gas diffusion is a method for producing MOF crystals through a sufficient reaction with a center metal ion solution using a volatile ligand solution as a solvent [76]. The hydrothermal method is carried out by mixing metal ions, organic ligands, regulators, reaction solvents, and other materials at a certain proportion in a polytetrafluoroethylene liner, which is then placed in a high-temperature reactor to initiate the reaction [71, 76-78]. Chen et al. used a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), which has a high drug loading capability and pH- sensitive degradation characteristics, to deliver an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3- MA); their results revealed a strong anticancer effect [42]. Their 3-MA@ZIF-8 NPs exhibited high 3-MA encapsulating efficiency (19.798 wt.%), uniform shape and size, excellent biocompatibility, and high stability under physiological conditions. In addition, they exerted strong antitumor activity and marked inhibition of autophagy in tumor-bearing mice, achieved via precise drug delivery for tumor mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, a phenomenon in which a certain amount of material accumulates more than normal tissue due to the vessels loosened by virtue of sudden angiogenesis in tumor tissue [79-81]. 3.2 Hybrid nanocomposites Nanocomposites are organic/inorganic hybrid composites designed to improve the mechanical and other properties, such as optical, electrical, magnetic, and rheological 15 characteristics, of the constituent materials. Nanocomposites consist of organic polymer matrices within which various types of inorganic nanoparticles have been incorporated, including metals, metal oxides, etc. However, the strong tendency to undergo agglomeration due to insufficient dispersal in polymer matrices results in degradation of the physical and chemical properties of nanocomposites [61]. To improve the dispersion and stability of inorganic nanoparticles in polymer matrices, surface modification is essential to generate a strong repulsion between the nanoparticles. Various synthetic methods have been developed to obtain well-defined nanocomposites with intriguing physical and chemical properties. 3.2.1 Physical blending The most straightforward and conventional method for the synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites is direct mixing of the inorganic nanoparticles into polymer matrices. Physical blending can generally be achieved by solution or melt blending. Solution blending involves mixing solutions of polymer and inorganic nanoparticles dispersed in a suitable solvent. The nanocomposite can be obtained by solvent removal, precipitation, and simple filtration. However, the difficulty of finding a suitable solvent and removing it in the final stage, and the latent toxicity of many solvents represent potential drawbacks of the solution blending method [61]. Chae et al. synthesized polystyrene (PS)/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites through solution blending, followed by film casting [51]. In this study, ZnO nanoparticles were dissolved in N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) with PS and stirred vigorously. After the ZnO nanoparticle and PS were thoroughly mixed, the mixture was cast at 90 °C to obtain a nanocomposite film. Solution blending evenly dispersed the ZnO nanoparticles homogeneously in the PS matrix, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. In addition, the introduction of ZnO nanoparticles into the PS matrix improved the 16 thermal stability by slightly increasing the glass transition temperature (Tg). Melt blending is a comparatively cost-effective and simple technique that removes the need for toxic solvents. In melt processing, inorganic nanoparticles are dispersed into a melted polymer, and the polymer/inorganic nanocomposites are then produced by extrusion [82]. However, due to the high viscosity of thermoplastic polymers, it is difficult to control the inorganic nanoparticle distribution in the matrix. Yuan et al. reported an efficient method for the preparation of polypropylene-grafted nano silica (PP-g-SiO2) through melt blending of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-MAH) and amino-functionalized silica (SN-NH2) [52]. PP-g-SiO2 was fabricated via condensation between the terminally maleic anhydride- functionalized PP and amino-functionalized SiO2. PP-MAH and SN-NH2 were blended in a Haake Polylab OS Rheo-Drive 7 modular torque rheometer at 140 °C and extracted with refluxing xylene. Finally, PP-g-SiO2 was dispersed in the polypropylene (PP) matrix to complete PP/PP-g-SiO2 nanocomposites by blending at 200 °C. TEM observation revealed relatively well-dispersed PP-g-SiO2 in the PP matrix. In addition, shear and extension-rheology results indicated an increase in the melt strength of PP. 3.2.2 In situ deposition A simple and efficient method for incorporating inorganic nanoparticles into polymer matrices is in situ deposition inside polymer matrices. Such in situ deposition yields a uniform distribution of the inorganic nanoparticles and generally avoids the use of solvents. This method involves dispersing the inorganic nanoparticles directly in the monomer solution prior to the polymerization process [82]. The incorporation of monomers into the polymeric matrix is achieved either from the gas or liquid phase [61]. Nanocomposites are fabricated by 17 polymerization through standard techniques, including mechanical methods (ultrasonication, stirring, etc.) or photoinitiation (UV curing), in solution containing a mixture of monomers with inorganic nanoparticles. Polymers that cannot be processed by solution mixing or melt blending, as well as thermally unstable polymers, can be processed via this method. Cheng et al. developed crosslinked dimethacrylate/silver nanocomposites by in situ deposition through photoinitiated free radical polymerization [56]. For preparation of crosslinked dimethacrylate/silver nanocomposites, silver 2-ethyl hexanoate was dissolved in a bisphenol A glycerolate methacrylate–triethylene glycol dimethyacrylate (BisGMA-TEGDMA) resin mixture, and the mixed resin solutions were photopolymerized with visible light. TEM confirmed that silver nanoparticles were homogenously dispersed throughout the polymer matrix, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the silver nanoparticles were preferentially located near the surface of the polymer matrix. 4. Structure and characterization of functional hybrid nanomaterials 4.1. Hybrid nanoparticles Hybrid nanoparticles have emerged at the frontier between materials chemistry and many other fields, such as biomedical [83-87], electronic [88, 89], pharmaceutical [90], optical [91- 93], and catalytic fields [24]. Organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles are interesting not only because they combine the functions of their original materials, but also because new properties can arise through synergy between individual components. Sometimes, the properties emerging from either the core or shell materials can be controlled. The properties can be modified by changing either the constituent materials or shell thickness. In the context of biomedical 18 applications, organic/inorganic hybrids can be used in two structures: core/shell and combined self-assembly. Below, we review both types of hybrid structures. 4.1.1. Core/shell structure Core/shell nanoparticles can be broadly defined as hybrid materials composed of two parts, a core and a shell, both of which can be composed of either organic or inorganic material. Multiple different combinations are possible, including inorganic/inorganic, inorganic/organic, organic/inorganic, and organic/organic. The shell material can compensate for the deficiencies of core materials in the context of biomedical applications. In this section, we will focus on inorganic/organic core/shell structures. For biomedical applications, various inorganic/organic core/shell structures have been developed, in which the inorganic parts are AuNPs [94], silica nanoparticles [95], QDs [96, 97], or magnetic nanoparticles [98], and the organic parts are polymers [99], lipids [100], or biomolecules [101, 102]. In general, due to their special physicochemical optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, the inorganic parts of core/shell nanostructures contribute to both imaging modalities and therapeutic effects. The optical properties, which include photoluminescence [103], fluorescence [104], and plasmonic resonance [105, 106], have been utilized for imaging [107, 108] and phototherapy [109, 110]. Moreover, the organic parts of core/shell nanostructures increase the biocompatibility and stability of inorganic nanostructures, and enable simultaneous loading of larger numbers of therapeutic agents, thereby maximizing theranostic properties. The surfaces of inorganic nanomaterials must usually be modified in order to interact under biological conditions [111, 112]. Because the surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles may be toxic or bio-incompatible, they can be capped with organic materials to make them more suitable them for biomedical applications [113]. The 19 organic parts of core/shell materials also confer enhanced flexibility, biocompatibility, dispersibility, and stability on inorganic nanoparticles [27]. Four types of organic materials are used to coat the surfaces of inorganic core materials. First, various polymers are used to impart functionality to the core of inorganic material. Polymers can be designed for a variety of purposes; accordingly, they can take many forms. In biological fluids, protein coronas form on the surfaces of inorganic particles, depending on their size and surface properties [114, 115]. Surface properties affect the composition of the protein corona, which is closely related to the correlation between cells and nanoparticles. Ultimately, this has a significant impact on the fate of inorganic nanoparticles in vivo [114, 116]. A better understanding of the changes in protein corona morphology changes by the polymer will facilitate the biomedical applications of inorganic nanoparticles. Protein adsorption onto inorganic nanoparticles can be controlled using hydrophilic polymers, which increase circulation time and accumulation in the target area relative to naked nanoparticles. Among various polymers, synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has traditionally been regarded as the gold standard for enabling biomedical applications of inorganic nanoparticles [117]. PEGylation creates a hydration layer, while also providing steric stabilization, resulting in the suppression of protein adsorption. Finally, it creates a suitable inorganic nanoparticle surface that interacts less strongly with the biological environment, significantly promoting the circulation of the nanoparticle in the blood. PEG is non-toxic, bioinert, and nonimmunogenic, and has been approved as an additive by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Hydrophilic PEG improves the biocompatibility and colloidal stability of nanoparticles, making them useful for biomedical applications [118]. Various nanoparticles have been modified with PEG to facilitate their in vivo applications [119-121]. PEGylation was first used in the context of drug delivery in 1977 by Davis et al., and we described the covalent attachment of PEG to bovine 20 serum albumin and liver catalase proteins [121]. By optimizing the PEGylation chemistry and the ratio of PEGylation, those authors used this approach to decrease immunogenicity and increase systemic circulation time of the proteins without significantly compromising activity. In 1990, the FDA approved the first PEGylated protein product, the PEGylated enzyme Adagen®, as a treatment for an immunodeficiency disease [117]. The success of protein PEGylation as a method for increasing circulating lifespan of drug molecules led to the development of nanoparticle PEGylation for systemic applications. In addition to in vivo distribution, PEGylation is also used to increase the stability of nanoparticles. For the synthesis of large magnetic nanoparticles, the PEGylation strategy can also be utilized to decrease agglomeration and increase stability in vivo [122]. Another organic shell material, biomolecules, can make inorganic nanoparticles more functional. Biomolecules primarily serve to increase the solubility of inorganic nanoparticles, make them more biocompatible, and in particular provide specific targeting functions. Various types of biomolecules, including antibodies [123], peptides [124], polysaccharides [125], and aptamers [126], have been widely used to target specific receptors onto targeted cells. In the design of active targeting nanohybrids, targeting molecules constituting the organic part are usually chemically conjugated or self-assembled in order to fulfill the targeting function without being modified themselves. For instance, chemically modified PEG is usually employed for linking the targeting moiety in the nanohybrids to maximize cell recognition with longer circulation times (Fig. 4a) [127]. The third class of candidates for organic shell materials are lipids. Lipid formulations are preferred agents for several reasons, including their high loading capacity, stability, and good reproducibility. Furthermore, they increase the likelihood of successful clinical application due to their scalability, ease of synthesis, and biocompatibility. Simple liposome-NP complexes 21 composed of multiple functional NPs and a single lipid vesicle can be formed in a variety of structural configurations, including lipids with surface-bound nanoparticles [128], lipids with bilayer-embedded nanoparticles [129], lipids with core-encapsulated nanoparticles [130], and lipid bilayer core-encapsulated nanoparticles (core/shell structures) [84]. The resultant nanostructure of such hybrids is not only significantly affected by the surface of NPs, but preserved as initial morphology of an intact liposome used. According to the surface properties of nanoparticles (i.e., hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity), they are located inside hydrophobic lipid bilayers or in the aqueous interiors of liposomes. Among various hybrid structures composed of lipids and nanoparticles, lipid/inorganic nanoparticle core/shell structures mainly serve to protect imaging and therapeutic nanoparticles from external biological conditions, while at the same time providing multifunctionality via specific ligands. In one example, several hydrophilic nanoparticles were introduced into the aqueous vesicular core prepared using an extrusion-based small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) method [131]. Specifically, lipid film hydration with aqueous nanoparticle solution, followed by subsequent sonication, was chosen as the preparative technique. Cryo-TEM revealed that the lipid-encapsulated nanoparticles were well dispersed. Faced with limitations in how nanoparticle surfaces can be functionalized with synthetic organic materials, researchers have begun to envision alternative strategies using bioinspired materials [132-134]. In particular, nanoparticles require many improvements to improve their stability in vivo, circulation time, and dissolution. To address these needs, the final candidate shell material, cell membrane coating technology, was first developed in 2011; in the first reported use, researchers directly leveraged entire cell membranes as materials for nanoparticle cloaking [135]. By directly transferring the cell membrane to the nanoparticle surface, the complexity of the lipid, protein, and carbohydrate-containing cell membranes can be faithfully 22 maintained, allowing the coated nanoparticles to acquire the characteristics of the source cell. Because the behavior of cells in vivo is usually determined by proteins on the cell membrane [136], direct coating with cell membrane gives nanoparticles the same characteristics as the source cells. For example, red blood cells (RBCs) are the cells with the longest circulation time in vivo [137], and they are not recognized by macrophages via the CD47 protein in the cell membrane. Therefore, the synthetic properties of RBC membrane-coated nanoparticles are concealed. In other examples, nanoparticle surfaces have been coated with membrane from stem cells (Fig. 4b) [29, 138, 139], cancer cells [140-143], and macrophages [144], allowing the characteristics of each cell membrane to be exploited in biomedical applications. Thus, cell membrane coating is a platform technology that provides an easy top-down method for the design of nanocarriers with surfaces that replicate the complex and diverse functions needed for effective bio-interfacing. Nanoparticles coated with cell membranes inherently mimic the characteristics of the source cells, giving them a wide range of functions such as long-term circulation, tissue tropism, and disease-related targeting. 4.1.2. Combined self-assembly Nanoparticle assemblies have special physicochemical properties that differ from individual nanoparticles or their indiscriminate aggregates [145, 146]. This self-assembly occurs primarily in a smart and programmed way, and relies on two important components: the ligands on the nanoparticle surface that respond to various stimuli, and the stimuli that enable the ligands to react. These assemblies can be designed to respond either exogenously (magnetic field, temperature, ultrasound, light, or electric pulses) or endogenously (pH, enzymatic activity, or redox gradients) [147]. As an example, pH is an important determinant of the release 23 of nanoparticles assembled by specific ligands. The physiological pH value in vivo depends on health status. In certain disease-related cells, such as cancer cells and infected cells, the local pH value is lower than that around healthy cells [148]. Differences in pH environment have been widely used to target treatment of specific diseases. Some functional ligands change from hydrophobic to hydrophilic after pH changes. Above pH 7, the hydrophobicity of functional ligands enables modified nanoparticles to be assembled. If the nanoparticle assembly encounters a pH below 7 in the environment of the cell associated with the disease, the functional group is protonated and becomes hydrophilic, triggering the release of nanoparticles into the fluids. Herein, we will focus on ligands that allow the assembly to be made in response to stimulation rather than various stimuli. Ligands involved in the assembly of nanoparticles include polymers and biomacromolecules. The polymer is not only structurally important for combined self-assembly of nanoparticles, but also for biomedical applications based on this principle. Because polymers generally improve pharmacokinetics, prolong circulation time in vivo of nanoparticles [149], and allow for targeted delivery through additional conjugation, well-designed stimulus-responsive nanoparticle self-assemblies usually employ stimulus-responsive polymers [150, 151]. The polymers used in nanoparticle assembly are mainly used to respond to stimuli such as pH, temperature, and light [148]. In general, a stimulus-responsive polymer has a specific moiety that changes in some way in the presence of a particular stimulus. Among the many interactions that determine the structural properties of nanoparticle assemblies, hydrophobic interactions are the most important due to the nature of the reactions taking place in biological fluids [32]. By activating these responses, polymeric moieties become hydrophilic as a result of protonation of hydrophobic moieties. Subsequently, the nanoparticle assemblies become unstable, followed by the disassembly of nanoparticles into the targeted region in vivo. Hyeon 24 et al. reported a pH-sensitive Pt nanocluster assembly that could overcome cisplatin resistance and heterogeneous stemness of hepatocellular carcinoma (Fig. 4c) [13]. Specifically, they synthesized a Pt nanocluster consisting of an assembled Pt nanocluster incorporating a pH- sensitive polymer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-targeting ligand. The Pt nanocluster assembly is latent during blood circulation but readily targets disseminated HCC cancer stem- like cells (CSLCs); upon binding, it disassembles into extremely small Pt nanoclusters under acidic subcellular conditions via protonation of pH-sensitive polymers. Thermosensitive polymers undergo structural changes at certain temperatures. To take advantage of this effect, it is necessary to increase the ambient temperature via the plasmonic property or the magnetothermal effect of nanoparticles. For instance, using poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide (PNIPAAm), one of the most widely used temperature-sensitive polymers, the distance between plasmonic gold nanoparticles can be controlled by adjusting the temperature, and the plasmonic properties can then be used in various biomedical applications (Fig. 4d) [152]. The utilization of nanoparticle assemblies in the biomedical field, especially in in vivo applications, requires biocompatibility together with low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity; accordingly, biomacromolecules are ideal structural linkers for nanoparticle assemblies. Several types of biomacromolecules, including polysaccharides, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids, can be used to assemble nanoparticles into smart aggregates. Among these macromolecules, proteins and peptides can be used as crosslinking agents, or to help nanoparticles form assemblies through chemical or amphipathic interactions [153]. To use proteins as crosslinking ligands for nanoparticle assemblies, multiple binding domains are used to promote nanoparticle aggregation by crosslinking the corresponding sites. Protein-based reversible assembly of AuNPs was reported by Otsuka et al. [154]. Specifically, they used a D-galactose residue to disassemble AuNP aggregates, inducing a color change of the solution 25 mediated by the distance-dependent surface plasmon properties of AuNPs [155]. Nucleic acids, especially single-stranded oligonucleotides, can form double-stranded DNA via complementary base pairing. The driving force of changes in the double helix structure is the formation of hydrogen bonds between A-T and C-G base pairs. A-T and C-G base pairs have 2 and 3 hydrogen bonds, respectively, which enable control of the thermal stability of DNA by adjustment of its GC content. The stability of double-stranded DNA depends on multiple factors, including GC content, length, nucleic acid concentration, salt concentration, etc. DNA can play a major role in combined self-assembly of nanoparticles through structural DNA base pairing. In 1996, Mirkin et al. first showed that spherical AuNPs (about 13 nm in diameter) bearing DNA oligonucleotides could be made to aggregate reversibly by varying the temperature; this effect was mediated by the formation and melting of DNA bridges between particles [156]. Subsequently, Alivisatos et al. reported that small (1–2 nm) gold clusters, each bearing a single-stranded DNA, could be assembled into dimers and trimers, which they termed ‘nanocrystal molecules’ [157]. Taking advantage of the molecular recognition properties of the DNA, DNA-based structures can serve as scaffolds for the assembly of nanoparticles using at least two different strategies. In the first strategy, the nanoparticles are functionalized with one or more single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides, allowing them to hybridize to complementary ssDNA sequences on specific positions on a pre-assembled DNA template. In the second strategy, each nanoparticle is first conjugated to an ssDNA sequence. These DNA– nanoparticle conjugates are then used to construct the tiles making up the lattice, and the nanoparticles are thereby incorporated into the larger lattice structure during its assembly. Over the last two decades, a wide spectrum of nanoparticle arrangements have been achieved using DNA molecules with complementary sequences as linkers. The development of the DNA origami method in 2006 has given rise to an extensive collection of structurally versatile 26 microscale and nanoscale DNA-modified nanoparticle assemblies [158]. This robust method is based on folding a long single-stranded DNA into a predefined shape with dozens of short oligonucleotides. The method allows creation of a variety of two- and three-dimensional shapes [159-162], and because each staple is addressable, it is straightforward to functionalize the structure in a controllable way or, on the other hand, create large arrays. The resultant nanostructures can readily be connected through sticky-end associations, as well as attached to nanoparticles using thiol-modified oligonucleotides. 4.2. Hybrid nanocomposites The polymer matrix into which inorganic nanoparticles are incorporated can consist of new high-functionality materials. This idea has inspired scientists to apply organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites in a variety of industries. Various types of inorganic particles, such as metal (e.g., Fe, Al, Ag, and Au), metal oxides (e.g., Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2, and CaCo3), and non-metal oxides (e.g., SiO2), have been used for synthesis of hybrid nanocomposites. Inorganic nanoparticles can be selected based on the desired thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties of the final hybrid nanocomposite. In biomedical applications, the functionality of hybrid nanocomposites can be improved by using nanoparticles that are capable of bioimaging or have physiological activity. For example, hybrid nanocomposites containing gold nanoparticles are suitable for computed tomography (CT) imaging due to their high X-ray absorption coefficient [163]. In this section, we classify organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites containing inorganic nanoparticles as matrix or hydrogel, and review the synthesis, structure, properties, and applications of these composites. 27 Figure 4. Various structures of hybrid nanoparticles: (a) PEGylated antibody conjugated gold nanoparticle (core/shell nanostructure)[127], (b) Cell membrane cloaked core/shell nanostructures for enhanced in vivo biodistribution[29], c) pH-sensitive Pt nanocluster assembly for targeting hepatocellular carcinoma[13], and d) Temperature-sensitive polymer, PNIPAAm, effects on gold nanoparticle aggregation (assembly) and color change[152]. The image is reproduced with permission from [13, 29, 127, 152]. 4.2.1. Organic/inorganic matrix An organic/inorganic matrix is a polymer matrix containing inorganic nanoparticles. Hybrid matrices exhibit improved properties that depend on the properties of the inorganic nanoparticles contained in the polymer matrix. The conventional synthetic method for hybrid matrix is simply to blend the inorganic nanoparticles with the polymer. In general, mixing can 28 be performed either by melt blending or by solution blending. The limitation of synthesis through blending is that it is difficult to uniformly disperse the nanoparticles in the polymer matrix due to their strong tendency to aggregate. Solution blending is used extensively in material synthesis and manufacturing because it allows liquid powders to be mixed evenly at the molecular level. Li et al. fabricated a polyurethane (PU)/ZnO nanoparticle matrix by solution blending PU and ZnO nanoparticles (diameter ~27 nm) [164]. Specifically, they synthesized a ZnO/PU solution as a film-type hybrid matrix using a simple casting and evaporation method. Melt blending is a method in which inorganic nanoparticles are dispersed in a polymer melt and then extruded to produce nanocomposites (Fig. 5a) [165]. To improve the mechanical and rheological properties of the polymer matrix, Kim et al. synthesized a hybrid matrix filled with silica nanoparticles by melt blending using an extruder. Similarly, Lee et al. prepared a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanocomposite containing magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2] and beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) through a twin-screw extruder [166]. A synthesis method that efficiently incorporates inorganic nanoparticles into polymer composites is in situ growth. In this technique, inorganic nanoparticles are generated from precursors present in the polymer matrix. Generally, the precursor is embedded in the polymer matrix in the liquid or gas phase, but in rare cases the solid phase is also possible. Various synthesis methods, including chemical reduction, photoreduction, and thermal decomposition, have been used in in situ nanoparticle fabrication [167, 168]. For example, the growth of silver and gold nanoparticles in the polymer matrix was induced by polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which acts as a reducing agent and stabilizer [169]. In situ fabrication of silver nanoparticles in PVA and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) polymer matrix has also been reported [170]. In this technique, the silver nanoparticles were effectively integrated into the polymer matrix without requiring 29 any modification of the particle surface. The mechanical, optical, magnetic, electrical, and thermal properties of an organic/inorganic matrix synthesized using one of the methods described above can be modulated depending on the type or content of inorganic nanoparticles in the polymer matrix [61]. The main motivation for adding inorganic nanoparticles to the polymer matrix is to improve mechanical properties (tensile strength, flexural strength, hardness, and Young’s modulus or stiffness) through reinforcement theories by the nanoparticles [171, 172]. Indeed, the addition of various inorganic nanoparticles to the polymer matrix can significantly improve the mechanical properties of the final organic/inorganic composite [173, 174]. Because bone tissue requires a higher strength and elastic modulus than soft tissue such as cartilage, hybrid materials with improved mechanical strength are suitable for use in hard tissue engineering. Recently, the Han group reported a hybrid nanocomposite in [Mg(OH)2] and β-TCP nanoparticles were embedded in PLGA polymer, with the goal of improving mechanical properties and effectively inducing bone differentiation (Fig. 5b-d) [166]. 30 Figure 5.

The image is reproduced with permission from [166]. 4.2.2. Organic/inorganic hydrogel Hydrogels, three-dimensional (3D) polymer networks that are physically (non-covalently) and/or chemically (covalently) crosslinked and highly hydrated, are used in several biomedical 31 applications [175-177]. However, the poor mechanical properties and limited functionality of hydrogels have prevented their wider application. Physical crosslinks resulting from the balance of intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, π–π interactions, and electrostatic interactions) between polymer and water, as well as between polymers, are reversible bonds that can be disassembled under changing physical conditions (pH, temperature, and ionic strength); consequently, physical hydrogels are often mechanically weak. Chemically crosslinked hydrogels often exhibit stronger mechanical properties than physical hydrogels due to their reliance on covalent bonding. In most cases, however, chemical hydrogels cannot resist intense mechanical stress (elongation, compression, or bending) due to their irregular crosslinking networks and short chain length at crosslinking points. Nanocomposite hydrogels are 3D organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposite systems that can be prepared by physical and/or chemical crosslinking of organic polymers in water in the presence of inorganic nanomaterials, such as silicate-based nanomaterials, calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, or metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (Fig. 6). Since the first report of the nanocomposite hydrogel using nanoclay and N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) in 2002 [178], several groups have sought to develop nanocomposite hydrogels that incorporate inorganic nanomaterials into organic hydrogels, with the goal of improving the physical properties and functionalities of conventional organic hydrogels [179- 181]. Incorporated functional inorganic nanomaterials not only reinforce soft organic hydrogels but also confer custom-made physical, chemical, and biological properties to hydrogels. These properties of nanocomposite hydrogels enable applications in various fields, including electronics, optics, sensors, microfluidics, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. Inorganic nanomaterials incorporated into organic polymer aqueous solutions can often interact with the polymer. Therefore, instead of using organic crosslinkers, inorganic 32 nanomaterials can be used as multifunctional crosslinkers, allowing the polymer chains to strongly interact with the nanomaterials at multiple binding points via non-covalent interactions. Clay (Laponite) was the first inorganic nanomaterial used as a crosslinker in nanocomposite hydrogels, and it remains most widely used. The Laponite nanosheet, a two- dimensional (2D) nano-silicate, can act as a crosslinker for NIPAAm to form PNIPAAm/Laponite-based nanocomposite hydrogels; the polymer chains bind the nearby clay nanosheets, dispersed in aqueous polymer solutions, via hydrogen bonding (Fig. 6a) [182-186]. The resultant PNIPAAm/Laponite network-based hydrogels are tough, transparent, and have improved thermal and mechanical properties. However, the negatively charged surface of Laponite can adsorb proteins, potentially initiating thrombosis. Therefore, to improve the hemocompatibility of Laponite-based nanocomposite hydrogels, Li et al. incorporated gelatin into the polyacrylamide (PAAm)/Laponite system [187]. The addition of gelatin to the hydrogels not only improved pH sensitivity, but also improved the antithrombogenic properties of nanocomposite hydrogels. Methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) can interact with Laponite via strong electrostatic interactions, and this GelMA/Laponite nanocomposite hydrogel exhibits enhanced physical, chemical, and biological properties (Fig. 6b) [188]. Exfoliated Laponite nanosheets can be coated with sodium polyacrylate co-assembled with amphiphilic europium (III) (Eu3+)-containing monomers via electrostatic interactions, yielding a supramolecular hydrogel possessing strong luminescence, extraordinary mechanical properties, and self- healing ability [189]. Other types of inorganic nanomaterials, including Fe3O4 nanoparticles, CaP nanoparticles, calcium hydroxide nano-spherulites (CNSs), gold, layered double hydroxide (LDH), and layered rare-earth hydroxide (LRH), have been successfully used to achieve novel nanocomposite hydrogels. Four-arm catechol-terminated PEG (4cPEG)/Fe3O4 nanocomposite 33 hydrogels crosslinked through reversible Fe-coordination bonds at the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit solid-like yet reversible hydrogel mechanics (Fig. 6c) [190]. CaP nanoparticles form reversible bonds with bisphosphonates on the bisphosphonate- functionalized HA (HABP) to form an injectable, cohesive, and self-healing HABP/CaP nanocomposite hydrogel (Fig. 6d) [30]. CNSs with diameters < 5 nm, which distribute homogeneously in water without any aggregation, interact with PAAm as a crosslinker to form a super-stretchable PAAm/CNS nanocomposite hydrogel (Fig. 6e) [191]. Collagen/gold nanocomposite hydrogels have been formed through electrostatic interaction between inorganic anionic clusters ([AuCl4]- ions) and positively charged collagen chains, followed by generation of gold nanoparticles via biomineralization, which functions as a crosslinker (Fig. 6f) [192]. A nanocomposite hydrogel consisting of PAAm and isethionate-loaded LDH nanoparticles, which has remarkable swelling properties, exhibits an unusual hierarchical porous structure and ultrahigh tensibility [193]. PAAm/LRH nanocomposite hydrogels prepared by in situ free radical polymerization can emit light of multiple colors with long luminescence lifetimes and high quantum yields [194]. Acrylated inorganic nanomaterials can crosslink acrylated organic polymers to form a hydrogel. A nanocomposite hydrogel of methacrylated HA (MeHA) and self-assembled acrylated-bisphosphonate-magnesium (Ac-BP-Mg) nanoparticles was stabilized by multivalent crosslinking domains formed by the aggregation of Ac-BP-Mg nanoparticles, conferring improved mechanical properties, capacity for mineralization, and controlled release of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 6g) [195]. Incorporation of methacrylated graphene oxide (GO) or reduced GO (rGO) into GelMA hydrogel yielded a highly porous microstructure and significantly improved the mechanical and biological properties (Fig. 6h) [196, 197]. In another approach, oligo(PEG) fumarate (OPF), acrylated GO (GOa), PEG-acrylated carbon nanotube (CNTpega), 34 and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (MTAC) were chemically crosslinked, followed by in situ reduction of GOa to obtain electrically conductive, positively charged rGOa/CNTpega/OPF/MTAC nanocomposite hydrogel (Fig. 6i) [198]. In situ mineralization is an effective way to generate uniformly distributed CaP nanoparticles in an organic hydrogel and improve the mechanical properties of nanocomposite hydrogels [199-201]. Rauner et al. reported enzyme (alkaline phosphatase)-induced in situ mineralization of poly-2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) linked by (l) triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PHEA- l-TEG), poly-N,N-dimethyl acrylamide-l-TEG (PDMA-l-TEG), or PAAm-l-N,N′-methylene bis(acrylamide) (PAAm-l-MBAm) hydrogels, resulting in ultra-stiff and tough nanocomposite hydrogels with tunable mechanics (Fig. 6j) [201]. Physical blending of inorganic nanomaterials and organic polymer aqueous solutions is an efficient way to prepare organic/inorganic nanocomposite hydrogels. For instance, nanocomposite hydrogels consisting of thermosensitive PEG-poly(L-alanine) diblock copolymer (PEG-PA) and GO or rGO were constructed by increasing the temperature of the PEG-PA aqueous solution in which GO or rGO are physically blended (Fig. 6k) [202, 203]. Recently, gel-forming water-soluble inorganic nanoparticles were discovered. Zhou et al. reported distinguished gel mechanics, with high storage and loss moduli, of biomimetic inorganic CdTe nanoparticles with short surface ligands (L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH). These materials combine strong supramolecular interactions and strong attractive forces specific to inorganic matter (Fig. 6l) [204].

Nanomedicine 37 Nanomedicine is defined as the medical application of nanotechnology for the prevention and treatment of various diseases [215, 216]. Nanoscale agents have remarkable potential in biomedical applications such as biosensors, diagnosis systems, and drug delivery systems (DDSs). DDSs are designed to alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution (BD) of their associated drugs. In particular, high loading capacity and the ability to protect a drug from the degradation by encapsulation on the nanoparticle are two ideal properties of nanoparticles as a tool for nanomedicine. One of the most intriguing properties of nanomedicines is that they can preferentially accumulate in cancer tissue through the leaky vascular structure of a tumor. This phenomenon, termed the EPR effect, has served as the basis for the development of nanomedicine that delivers drugs to tumors (Fig. 7) [216]. Passive tumor-targeted delivery increases the therapeutic effect of delivered drugs, minimizing their off-target side effects relative to their original forms. The biomedical applications of hybrid nanomaterials as a nanomedicine were investigated and summarized in Table 3. Table 3.

Schematic diagrams depicting tumor vasculatures and the characteristics of passive targeted accumulation of nanomedicine in tumor tissues through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. 5.1.1. Theranostics The distinct properties of nanoparticles, including their small size, large surface area, and ideal in vivo kinetics (especially, as noted above, the EPR effect), have triggered the development of nanomedicine using a variety of nanoscale materials [263]. The aim of nanomedicine is the improvement of a drug’s specificity for target sites to minimize side effects and maximize therapeutic efficiency. As drug delivery technology evolves, and new types of molecular probes have led to advances in imaging technology, demand has grown for combinations of imaging and drug delivery technologies that enable accurate diagnosis and treatment of cancer, a concept termed theranostics [264]. Theranostics refers to the concept of integrating both diagnostic and therapeutic functions into a single platform that enables real-time disease monitoring and treatment. The capability 40 to monitor drug accumulation in target tissues and therapeutic responses empowers the development of personalized medicine by optimizing treatment strategies (Fig. 8). In this regard, organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles have emerged as promising theranostic agents due to their novel bioimaging properties (CT, MR, and optical) and disease-specific targeting ability, which are derived from their inorganic nanoparticle and organic polymer components, respectively [265]. Tumor-specific accumulated hybrid nanoparticles enable accurate disease diagnosis and delivery or release of therapeutic agents, including small-molecule chemotherapeutics (such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and biotherapeutics (such as protein drugs, antibodies, DNA, siRNA, and miRNA) [264]. Theranostic agents provide both diagnosis and treatment with the same nanoformulation. Min et al. developed doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded calcium carbonate (CaCO3) hybrid nanoparticles (DOX-CaCO3-MNPs) for cancer-specific ultrasound imaging and chemotherapy [266]. These nanoparticles selectively accumulate in tumor tissue via the EPR effect. In addition, in the acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment, they decomposed and generated CO2 bubbles, enabling cancer-specific DOX release and US imaging. In mice bearing SCC-7 tumors, DOX-CaCO3-MNPs exerted a significant anticancer therapeutic effect relative to the control and free DOX-treated groups. In addition, these nanoparticles made it possible to detect long-lasting tumor-specific US image signals. 41 Figure 8. Schematic illustration of the theranostics concept. Theranostics is defined as combined modality, both therapy, and diagnosis in a single platform. More advanced theranostics agents have developed with the progress of various nanocarriers and imaging agents. [267].

Cancer Immunotherapy As nanoparticle technology for drug delivery has advanced, its application has spread to various fields. In particular, nanoparticles have the potential to be used as nanovaccines in cancer immunotherapy, a promising strategy for inhibiting cancer progression that involves activation and recruitment of the patient’s own immune system (Fig. 9a). Nanoparticles have also been used as vehicles to deliver immunostimulants (antigen/adjuvant) and agents that induce generation of endogenous cancer antigens, with the goal of eliciting an adaptive immune response [268-270]. Binding or encapsulation of antigens and adjuvants within nanoparticles has yielded significantly improved antitumor immune responses (i.e., T- and B-cell responses) relative to non-nanoparticle-based antigens and adjuvants [269]. Unlike nanoparticles that aim to deliver chemotherapeutics into tumor cells bypassing surveillance by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and other phagocytes, nanovaccines act directly on APCs or even directly trigger activation of tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific T-cells [269]. Kang et al. reported AuNP-based vaccines that stimulate CD8+ T-cell responses through antigen delivery to lymph nodes (Fig. 9b) [222]. For analysis of the CD8+ T-cell response, recombinant ovalbumin (OVA) was selected as a model antigen and conjugated to AuNP (OVA-AuNP). OVA-AuNPs successfully induced maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), an important aspect of effective immune responses in vitro. Interestingly, the OVA-AuNPs accumulated in DCs of lymph nodes of C57BL/6 mice, leading to CD8+ T-cell response with elevated IFN-γ secretion. Consistent with these results, tumor growth was remarkably inhibited in mice immunized with OVA-AuNPs relative to the PBS control group. Another approach for eliciting an immune response with hybrid nanoparticles is in situ vaccination that induction of endogenous cancer antigens through the in situ destructions of 43 tumors [268]. Nam et al. demonstrated that release of tumor antigens and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by hyperthermia-induced tumor cell death promote antitumor immune activation (Fig. 9c) [223]. Nano-spike gold nanoparticles (SGNPs) were coated with polydopamine (PDA) to provide photothermal stability to SGNPs and improve their photothermal efficiency. In addition, sub-therapeutic doses of doxorubicin were co- administered with PDA-coated SGNPs to elicit a robust antitumor immune response (chemo- photothermal therapy, chemo-PTT). In vivo results in the CT26 colon carcinoma model revealed that chemo-PTT exerted a remarkable therapeutic effect by inducing antitumor immunity, as well as long-term resistance against tumor-rechallenge. The immunotherapeutic effects of hybrid nanoparticle-based modalities can be further improved by combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) which is blocking the immune-inhibitory pathway and amplifying T cell activation [271]. Chao et al. proposed a combination of magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (anti-CTLA4) checkpoint inhibitor to achieve enhanced immunotherapeutic effect. For the effective MHT, poly(ethylene glycol)/dopamine co-grafted iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) were prepared. In a tumor mouse model, FeNPs-based MHT was able to trigger systemic antitumor immune responses by producing tumor-associated antigens. Notably, the combination of FeNPs-based MHT together with administrated anti-CTLA4 potentiate significantly enhanced tumor-associated antigen-specific immune response compare to single treatment of MHT owing to the function of anti-CTLA4 to inhibit the immune escape mechanism of tumors [272]. 44 Figure 9. Schematic illustration of the nanoparticle based immunotherapy for cancer: (a) Nanoparticles play a critical role at various points in the cancer immunotherapy, enhancing therapeutic efficiency [273], (b) AuNPs based vaccines for CD8+ T-cell response induction by delivery OVA to lymph nodes [222], and (c) Polydopamine-coated spiky AuNPs as a photothermal agent that induce release of cancer cell antigens, resulting in antitumor immune response activation [223]. The image is reproduced with permission from [222, 223, 273]. 45 5.1.3. Photodynamic therapy Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising non-invasive strategy for the treatment of various diseases, including cancers, using cytotoxic singlet oxygen (1O2) generated from photosensitizers (PSs) through light irradiation [274, 275]. However, because the hydrophobicity of PSs causes aggregation under physiological conditions, their application to the biomedical field has been limited. Another hurdle hindering the clinical applications of PSs is their severe side effects, including phototoxicity due to their relatively low selectivity for tumors [276]. Several strategies have been tested to overcome these limitations, including fabrication of polymeric photosensitizers [277] and development of nanocarriers (liposomes, silica nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, etc.) for PS loading and delivery [276]. Despite these significant efforts, high therapeutic efficiency has yet to be achieved. One of the main downsides of PDT is its inability to treat deep tumors due to the poor tissue penetration of visible light, further limiting the applications and therapeutic efficacy of this approach [31]. Lanthanide ion-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have received attention as a means of overcoming the limitations of conventional PDT [278]. UCNPs can be used as nanotransducers for deep tissue PDT by upconverting absorbed NIR light to high energy visible light. In upconversion, two or more near-infrared (NIR) photons are absorbed sequentially by a trivalent lanthanide ion incorporated in a suitable inorganic host lattice, producing a single high energy photon (anti-Stokes shift); this phenomenon relies on the long lifetime and ladder- like energy levels of these ions [264]. By efficiently converting deeply penetrating NIR light to a visible wavelength that can excite photosensitizers to produce cytotoxic 1O2, UCNPs enable deep tissue PDT or light-activated drug release and therapy. Li et al. developed tumor pH-sensitive photodynamic nano agents (PPNs) composed of self- assembled photosensitizers grafted to pH-responsive polymeric ligands (PLLs) and UCNPs, 46 and demonstrated an improved PDT effect (Fig. 10a) [227]. PPNs consist of α-NaYF4:Yb (80%), an Er (2%)@CaF2 core, and a surface coating of PLLs. The PLLs, in turn, are composed of mPEG-poly (β-benzyl-L-aspartate), 1- (3-aminopropyl) imidazole (API), and 3-phenyl-1- propylamine. PPN fluorescence is quenched at blood pH (~7.4) but can quickly switch to a dequenched state at the pH of the tumor microenvironment (~6.5) due to the ionization of the imidazole groups (pKa = 6.8). Therefore, upon irradiation with NIR light at pH 6.5, the lanthanide core of PPNs absorbs these photons and emits high energy visible light, thereby exerting a PDT effect by exciting Chlorin e6 (Ce6) of PLLs. PPNs exhibited improved antitumor effects against deep-seated tumors in A549 tumor-bearing nude BALB/c mice, indicating that they could overcome limitations on the PDT effect due to the low tissue- penetration depth of visible light. Despite many efforts to overcome limited penetration of light, low skin penetration depth of light is a still main downside factor that hinders the PDT efficacy. With this in mind, another approach to overcoming the low penetration depth of light is utilization of nano-scintillator– mediated X-ray–inducible PDTs that emit light under ionizing radiation. X-rays exhibit high tissue penetration up to 2 cm (4–25 megavoltage [MW] or \"deep\" X-rays), four times deeper than infrared wavelengths (5 mm) depending on the energy level [279]. Lanthanide-doped nano-scintillators, which have high-Z numbers and proper electronic energy states, emit photons in the UV, visible, and NIR regions when irradiated with γ- or X- rays. This provides a solution to bridge the wide energy mismatch between PSs and γ- or X- rays [279]. A cascade interaction of high energy photons of X-rays with the nano-scintillator lattice occurs through the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering effect, generating many electron-hole pairs. Consecutive trapping of the electron and hole at the luminescence center, followed by their radiative recombination, create luminescence [279]. The luminescence 47 (energy) generated from the nano-scintillator activates the adjacent PS and leads to cytotoxic 1O2 production via energy transfer (Fig. 10b) [31]. In addition to the exogenous factors limiting the effect of PDT, various endogenous inhibitors of the PDT effect exist in tumor microenvironments. Due to the rapid growth of cancers and their irregular shape, vascular function cannot meet the cancer’s oxygen demand, resulting in a hypoxic and acidic cancer microenvironment [280]. Low-oxygen tumor microenvironments not only inhibit photodynamic therapy effects but also increase tumor invasion, promote metastasis, and contribute to chemo-resistance. Therefore, a great deal of effort has been devoted to improving PDT efficacy by improving the tumor microenvironment. For example, several studies have sought to improve PDT efficiency by ameliorating the hypoxic tumor microenvironment through delivery of perfluorocarbon (PFC)-based O2 nanoparticles to tumor tissue [281, 282]. However, the amount of oxygen delivered to tumor tissue in this manner is very limited and is not sufficient to improve the efficacy of PDT [7]. Due to the aberrant metabolism of tumors, endogenous concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can be decomposed into oxygen and water, is higher than that of normal tissue. Based on this phenomenon, several research groups have begun to develop nano-systems that can generate oxygen in tumor microenvironments using endogenous H2O2. Zhang et al. have designed an all-in-one nanoplatform (FMZ/DC NPs) that integrates chemical and PDT therapy, oxygen generation, and pH sensitivity into a single system to improve the therapeutic effect against hypoxic cancer (Fig. 10c) [229]. This versatile nanoplatform is based on MnO2 nanoparticles that react with H2O2 to form O2 (Mn2+ + H2O + 1/2O2 ↑), thereby increasing the PDT effect. In vitro, FMZ/DC NPs produce oxygen via reaction with H2O2, confirming that the therapeutic effects of PDT can be improved. Consistent with the in vitro result, experimental evidence obtained in vivo has shown that the hypoxic 48 environment could be overcome by a significant increase in the oxygen level. These approaches have led to successful antitumor PDT in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Figure 10. Various design of hybrid nanoparticles for advanced photodynamic therapy (PDT): (a) Upconversion nanoparticle enhancing PDT effect by increasing the tissue penetration depth of light [283], (b) Nano-scintillator as an X-ray induced PDT agent that converts ionizing irradiation to UV fluorescence to achieve high antitumor therapeutic effects against deep- seated tumors [31] and (c) Versatile oxygen generating hybrid nanoparticle to overcome hypoxic tumor microenvironment[229]. The image is reproduced with permission from [31, 229, 283]. 5.1.4. Photothermal therapy Hyperthermia (≤ 43 °C) can induce a heat-shock response in cancer cells, inducing their destruction. Given that cancer cells are more vulnerable to hyperthermal damage than normal cells [243], hyperthermal therapy has begun to attract attention as an anticancer therapy. 49 However, conventional hyperthermal therapies that require external thermal stimuli, such as radiofrequency (RF) or NIR irradiation, can cause non-selective tissue heating, resulting in severe side effects [284]. In addition, external thermal stimulation generates a temperature gradient with a maximum on the body’s surface that dissipates as it passes through the tissues. To address this issue, various hyperthermal agents have been developed that generate heat in situ in response to non-hyperthermal external stimuli. One of the most promising hyperthermal cancer treatment modalities is photothermal therapy (PTT), which utilizes the heat generated by NIR laser irradiation of light-absorbing photothermal agents [284]. Ideally, PTT could maximize the efficacy of cancer therapy by transferring heat generated from photothermal agents directly to cancer cells while minimizing side effects by focusing the laser directly on cancer cells (Fig. 11a-c) [229]. Recently, small organic molecules such as heptamethine dyes and indocyanine green (ICG) have emerged as potential PTT agents [285]. ICG absorbs strongly in the NIR spectrum and can convert absorbed light to localized heat, triggering hyperthermia and inducing the destruction of cancer cells [286]. However, due to the concentration-dependent aggregation, short half-life, and poor in vivo stability of ICG, its application in cancer hyperthermal therapy has been limited. Through suitable nanocarrier design, however, ICGs can be delivered specifically to targeted cancer cells with improved selectivity. Zhang et al. have developed a multifunctional cancer-targeting PTT hybrid nanoplatform (ICG@MCNPs) that improves the photostability and photothermal conversion effect of ICG (Fig. 11a). Their system exerts a significantly stronger photothermal therapeutic effect against 4T1 breast cancer cells under NIR laser irradiation. In addition, in vivo photothermal therapy demonstrated that these ICG-loaded hybrid nanoparticles could effectively target tumor sites, leading to dramatic PTT at tumors [287]. 50 Ma et al. successfully fabricated fluorescence/magnetic resonance dual-mode imaging- guided photothermal therapy agents for tumor ablation (Fig. 11b). These agents, SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs, were fabricated by introducing DSPE-PEG 5000 and ICG molecules to oleylamine-stabilized SPIO NPs [232]. ICG loaded into SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NP is significantly more photostable than free ICG. Also, the in vivo MR and fluorescence imaging properties of SPIO@DSPE-PEG/ICG NPs enables tumor-specific PTT, leading to successful tumor ablation through photothermal effects. Figure 11. Structure of hybrid nanoparticles for the photothermal therapy (PTT): (a) ICG loaded multifunctional cancer targeted PTT agent for NIRF/MR dual modal imaging and PTT of tumor [231], (b) Biodegradable SPIO nanoparticles coated with DSPE-PEG for imaging guided PTT [232], and (c) Plasmon resonant liposome AuNPs capable of eradicating cancer cells through the PTT [233].

Gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9) Genome editing technology is an efficient and accurate technology that induces double- strand breaks in specific target sequences and then modifies, replaces, or inserts a desired gene. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR- associated (Cas) proteins, which are a part of the adaptive immune system in bacteria, have attracted attention as a genome editing tool [288]. The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of a single guide RNA (sgRNA), which forms complementary base pairs with a target DNA, and a specific endonuclease protein, Cas9, which cleave the DNA at specific sites [198]. The most captivating applications of CRISPR/Cas9 are knock-out of disease-related genes and the correction of genetic defects in diseased cells and tissues. To realize this potential, however, the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system must be delivered to its intracellular target site efficiently and safely (Fig. 12a-c). To this end, Mout et al. developed a direct cytosolic delivery system for CRISPR/Cas9-ribonucleoprotein (Cas9En) using cationic arginine AuNP (ArgNP)- based nano-assemblies. This system dramatically improved the cytoplasmic/nuclear delivery of the gene editing system, reaching efficiencies of ~90% [236]. 52 Figure 12.

The image is reproduced with permission from [236-238]. 5.1.6. Transducers for physical stimuli Several types of inorganic nanoparticles can be used as versatile transducers that convert physical stimuli into other forms (Fig. 13). For instance, magnetic nanoparticles can convert magnetic fields into mechanical force or heat, and AuNPs can transform light into heat. Notably in this regard, transducer nanoparticles can be controlled in vivo in a remote-controlled manner because the external energy source signals (e.g., magnetic field or light) penetrate biological tissue non-invasively. When applied to magnetic nanoparticles composed of Fe3O4, oscillating magnetic fields in the kHz to MHz range generate heat via two mechanisms, the Brownian modes and Neél modes. 53 Brownian modes produce heat through the friction arising from particle oscillations, whereas Neél modes do so via the magnetic moment-rotation that occurs with each field oscillation [289]. Accordingly, iron oxide nanoparticles have been extensively investigated for their applications to hyperthermal therapy. In addition, the high penetration of the magnetic field makes iron oxide-based hyperthermal therapy one of the more promising cancer therapies in the biomedical area [70]. AuNPs are efficient transducers that convert light into heat through rapid relaxation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which in this case involves the excitation of free electrons of gold atoms when exposed to light, leading to a state of collective oscillation [290]. Zhao et al. constructed anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) peptide-conjugated PEGylated triangular AuNPs (TGN-PEG-P75) to eradicate non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is notoriously difficult to treat [240]. TGN has a strong NIR absorption window, high photothermal conversion efficacy, and good biocompatibility. The peptide P75 promotes selective accumulation of TGN-PEG-P75 in the tumor site. TGN-PEG-P75 exhibits high photothermal conversion efficiency in vivo, resulting in successful tumor ablation through the photo-induced thermal effect. 54 Figure 13. Schematic overview of nanoparticle transducer. Nanoparticle transducers transform one physical cue into another types of stimuli that can have a biological effect [291].

Medical devices Over the last decade, new medical applications of hybrid nanocomposites have emerged, and most of these applications require multiple functionalities of hydrogel networks and dynamic interactions between the surrounding matrices and cells [177, 179-181]. Innovative advances in polymer chemistry, nanotechnologies, and biomolecular engineering have allowed us to overcome limitations in the design of nanocomposite materials with customized 55 functionality. In this section, among various applications of nanocomposite materials, we will focus on biomedical applications related to scaffolds for tissue engineering, vascular stents, and dental materials (Table 3). 5.2.1. Scaffolds for tissue engineering Polymer scaffolds (porous scaffolds, hydrogels, or films) lack the required mechanical strength and in vivo degradation characteristics, particularly for load-bearing regenerative applications. Therefore, in recent years, interest has grown in the development of nanocomposite scaffolds that can overcome the limitations of conventional polymer scaffolds [292, 293]. Nanocomposite scaffolds can be tuned to mimic the physical and chemical properties of native tissues using various nanomaterials, including silicate-based, CaP, carbon- based, and metal/metal oxide nanoparticles that have been physically or chemically combined with synthetic or natural polymers. Tailored nanocomposite scaffolds can provide a 3D network, porosity, solute diffusion properties, nano (micro)-structured surfaces, tunable surface chemistry properties, tissue-mimetic elasticity, hydrophilicity, and mechanical stiffness [294-298]. These advantageous properties of nanocomposite scaffolds allow for better cell– matrix interaction, guided migration, cell proliferation, and/or cell differentiation. Silicate-based nanomaterials are widely used due to their hydrophilic nature and large surface areas, which are easy to functionalize with bioactive molecules such as growth factors and cell-adhesive ligands. These functional moieties in turn improve their tissue regeneration capacity and biocompatibility at much higher doses than most other nanomaterials; moreover, the degradation products are non-toxic, absorbable, and related to osteogenic cell function [188, 299-302]. For instance, 2D Laponite-loaded GelMA hydrogels promote osteogenesis of preosteoblasts in the absence of any osteoinductive factors (Fig. 14a) [188]. Laponite 56 nanoplatelets incorporating regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) form an injectable RSF/Laponite nanocomposite hydrogel with potential for application in repair of irregular bone defects [245]. Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), dioctahedral clay minerals, and incorporated porous chitosan– agarose–gelatin nanocomposite scaffolds exhibit excellent resorption within 6 weeks after implantation; in addition, neo-vascularization in the new connective tissue penetrates the implanted nanocomposite scaffold [246]. In another example, biodegradable and osteoblast- bearing nanocomposite hydrogel constructs consisting of PEGDA/Laponite and HA, intended for applications related to bone regeneration, were developed via a two-channel 3D-bioprinting method (Fig. 14b) [247]. Due to their promising mechanical properties, biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and resorbability, CaP nanoparticles, including hydroxyapatite and -tricalcium phosphate, are the most extensively used nanomaterials for bone regeneration applications involving incorporation of nanocomposite scaffolds. For instance, CaP nanoparticles embedded in HABP nanocomposite hydrogels exhibit self-healing capability, adhesion to mineral surfaces, and the ability to interact with bone, as demonstrated by bone ingrowth following implantation of the hydrogels (Fig. 14c) [30]. Nanocomposite scaffolds consisting of cryogenic 3D-printed hierarchical porous CaP/poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) loaded with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) exhibited successful dual delivery of rhBMP-2 and Ca2+ ions, and promoted the osteogenic differentiation of seeded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) [248]. Nanocomposite scaffolds composed of in situ mineralized, microporous, mechanically stiff, bioactive, and biodegradable zinc crosslinked with gellan/xanthan/bioglass exhibit improved osteoconductivity and antibacterial properties [249]. Self-assembled Ac-BP-Mg nanoparticles incorporated into MeHA/BP-Mg nanocomposite hydrogels facilitate bone regeneration without requiring the addition of cells or 57 inductive agents (Fig. 14d) [195]. Due to their favorable optical, mechanical, thermal, and electrical conductivity properties, carbon-based nanomaterials have been used to generate nanocomposite scaffolds with intriguing properties [177, 303, 304]. GelMA hydrogels incorporating CNT, which exhibit mechanical and electrical properties, improve cardiac cell adhesion, maturation, and cell–cell coupling [250]. Similarly, polyethyleneimine-functionalized GO nanosheets (fGO) carrying angiogenic genes incorporated into GelMA hydrogel improve revascularization and contractile performance in the infarcted hearts (Fig. 14e) [251]. GelMA/rGO nanocomposite hydrogels mimic the microenvironment of the cardiomyocyte ECM, and thus improve cardiac tissue morphogenesis and beating behavior (Fig. 14f) [197]. GO- and rGO-embedded thermosensitive PEG-PA hydrogels exhibit enhance chondrogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively, in tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) (Fig. 14g) [202, 203]. Using a molding method, electrically conductive and positively charged rGOa/CNTpega/OPF/MTAC nanocomposite hydrogels were successfully fabricated into conductive nerve conduits with a positive charge and inherent incorporated conductivity, providing additional options for clinical applications in neuronal tissue engineering (Fig. 14h) [198]. Metal/metal oxide nanoparticles have been used to generate nanocomposite scaffolds responsive to elastic, thermal, and magnetic stimuli. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) incorporated into GelMA hydrogels exhibit relatively low electrical impedance and significantly higher mechanical strength [252]. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes seeded in GelMA/AuNR nanocomposite hydrogels exhibit significant improvements in cell–matrix interaction, cell–cell coupling, and function of engineered cardiac tissue (Fig. 14i). AuNPs incorporated into GelMA hydrogel improve proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells in vitro and in vivo, and the magnitude of the effect depends on the dose of AuNPs (Fig. 58 14j) [253]. Mg(OH)2 or surface-modified Mg(OH)2 nanoparticles can serve as effective neutralizers for the acidic degradation byproducts of PLA [166, 207, 254, 305]. Recently, the Han group reported the efficient anti-inflammatory effect of Mg(OH)2 nanoparticles in renal or cartilage tissue engineering by using a hybrid nanocomposite scaffold of PLGA/decellularized renal ECM/Mg(OH)2 or PLGA/Mg(OH)2, respectively (Fig. 14k and l) [18, 254]. These advanced nanocomposite scaffolds can simulate the characteristics of native tissues to a certain extent, but many problems must be overcome before they can be applied as artificial biomaterials for clinical use. For instance, a major challenge in tissue engineering is the development of biomaterials that provide biochemical and mechanical signaling cues in a gradient and sequential manner, as native ECMs do, to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration during wound healing, tissue regeneration, and homeostasis. Therefore, future efforts to design advanced nanocomposite scaffolds should focus on providing sequential physical (topography, material stiffness, and porosity) and chemical (concentration of signaling biomolecules) gradients within a nanocomposite scaffold by tuning the structure, composition, stimulus responsiveness, and controlled release of bioactive molecules from nanomaterials and/or nanocomposite scaffolds. 59 Figure 14.

Vascular Implants Since Dr. Jacques Puel first introduced the technique 1986 [306], coronary stent implantation has become routine worldwide as a standard approach to treating coronary artery disease. Two different types of vascular stents, bare-metal stents (BMSs) and drug-eluting stents (DESs), are widely used for treating the blocked coronary arteries. In-stent restenosis (ISR) caused by immune response or intimal hyperplasia frequently occurs in BMSs, whereas late stent thrombosis (ST) originating from drug-polymer matrix hypersensitivity and reduced re- endothelialization is quite common in DESs [307, 308]. To avoid these problems, novel methods involving the development of nanocomposite biomaterials are being intensely investigated [308]. Nanocomposite biomaterials, which have great potential to improve stent hemocompatibility, are candidates for the development of cardiovascular stents. Carbon dot-silver nanohybrid (CD-Ag) incorporating starch-modified hyperbranched polyurethane (HPU) nanocomposite (HPU/CD-Ag) exhibits self-expandability, and improved thermal, mechanical, and biological properties, as well as cytocompatibility, hemocompatibility, and infection resistance. These features support the use of HPU/CD-Ag as a material for self-expandable stents (Fig. 15a) [255]. In addition to hemocompatibility, vascular implants should also be able to prevent inflammation and ISR. The recent clinical failures of coronary artery dilation studies using everolimus-releasing poly(lactide) (PLA)-based absorbable vascular scaffolds may have been due to inflammatory reactions induced by acidic degradation products of PLA [207, 309]. Cobalt–chromium (Co-Cr) stents coated with surface-modified Mg(OH)2 nanoparticles (RA- Mg-OLA) and sirolimus-loaded PLGA showed significantly suppressed inflammatory 61 reactions induced by ISR and acidic degradation byproducts (Fig. 15b) [207]. Endothelialization plays an important role in the long-term success of cardiovascular implants [257]. Late Angiographic Stent Thrombosis (LAST) is a major limitation of DES, which often fails stent implantation in a clinical trial. LAST occurs as a result of delayed endothelialization of stent struts. From this standpoint, improving re-endothelialization or relining exposed regions represents the most efficient way to improve the clinical translation rate in the field of vascular stent implantation. Various techniques for achieving rapid re- endothelialization have been developed over the past few years, including active endothelial cell coating and the use of nanocomposites that promote endothelialization [308, 310]. For instance, a polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)–poly(carbonate-urea) urethane (PCU) nanocomposite polymer was successfully coated onto a BMS surface, followed by covalent binding with anti-CD34, and the resultant nanocomposite polymer coating facilitated re- endothelialization by capturing endothelial progenitor cells via the antibody (Fig. 15c) [256]. A nanocomposite biomaterial patch of gold nanoparticles conjugated decellularized arterial tissue matrices implanted in a longitudinal arteriotomy of the porcine thoracic aorta exhibited good integration with host tissue, improved re-endothelialization, and did not fail over the 6- month implantation period [258]. Collagen/Au nanocomposite containing 43.5 ppm Au exhibits better biomechanical properties and thermal stability than pure collagen. Moreover, when Wharton’s jelly-derived MSC seeded collagen/Au nanocomposite coated catheters were implanted in the femoral artery of Sprague–Dawley rats, the material exhibited compliance, antithrombogenicity, biostability, endothelialization, and hemocompatibility [257]. Because the experiments on each nanocomposite were performed under different environments, future studies should seek to compare various nanocomposites under the same conditions to facilitate selection of the best nanocomposites for the vascular stent. 62 5.2.3. Dental implants Many types of dental materials have been developed to date, including temporary dressings, dental restorations (fillings, cement, resins, crowns, and bridges), dental impressions (negative imprints of teeth), prosthetic materials (dentures), and dental implants. For repair of dental caries and other defects, conventional mercury-containing amalgam alloys were replaced by composite resins in the 1960s due to their biocompatibility and aesthetic qualities, as well as the latter’s advantages in terms of operation technique [311, 312]. To further improve the mechanical, chemical, and biological properties of dental restorative resin composites, researchers have explored incorporation of inorganic nanomaterials (fillers) into resin matrix containing photocrosslinkable polymers (e.g., bisphenol A glycerolate dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, urethane dimethacrylate, etc.) [313]. The first inorganic nanomaterial used for dental resin-based composites was silica. Subsequently, many inorganic nanomaterials have been developed to improve the mechanical properties, fracture toughness, surface wetting properties, adhesion properties, and anti-caries function of dentin and enamel, as well as decrease tendency to stain and shrink. Resin-based composites incorporating methacrylated POSS exhibit reduced shrinkage [143], improved mechanical properties, and scratch resistance [259]. Dental resin based on bromide/cationic polymer (AgBr/NPVP) nanocomposite-modified poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is cytocompatible, and just 0.1 wt.% of AgBr/NPVP is sufficient to suppress fungal growth [260]. Recently, Weir et al. reported effective dentin lesion remineralization using a nanocomposite consisting of resin [ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate (EBPADMA) and acidic pyromellitic glycerol dimethacrylate (PMGDM)] and CaP nanoparticles, indicating that resin/CaP nanocomposites are promising restorative materials that can both remineralize tooth lesions to protect tooth structures and inhibit secondary caries (Fig. 15d) [261]. 63 Nanocomposite biomaterials have also been developed for periodontal tissue engineering (Fig. 15e and f) [314]. The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is to create an environment that helps patients maintain their dental health, comfort, and function. Various nanocomposite scaffolds studied in the context of bone regeneration, discussed in Section 5.2.1, represent promising candidate materials for periodontal tissue engineering. A major limitation of current synthetic dental implants is their failure to adapt to the local tissue environment. Although implant materials such as titanium and its ternary alloys have been successfully used for dental implants and prostheses for about 30 years, they are limited by the fact that cells do not adhere directly (or adequately) to most metallic surfaces. Accordingly, the goal of utilizing nanocoatings and nanocomposites is to modify the surface properties of dental implants to accelerate the healing process. For instance, hydroxyapatite-coated implants have been shown to interface strongly with bone at the implanted site in animal models [315]. Another major requirement of dental implants is wear resistance. Carbon-based nanomaterials have been used to increase the wear resistance of dental implants [316]; among them, diamond-like carbon coatings have received a deal of attention in recent years due to their inherent mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties [317]. Despite their advantages, they have several drawbacks such as high internal stress, poor adhesive properties, and high sensitivity to ambient conditions. To overcome these limitations, carbon nanocomposite coating (CNC) was performed on Co- Cr alloy plates using a C60 ion beam [317]. The CNC deposition significantly improved the biocompatibility and durability of the implant and improved new tissue formation without necrosis, indicating that this approach is promising for orthopedic and dental applications. For the complete and concurrent regeneration of the three types of periodontal tissues, the tissue- specific tri-layered nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold has been used (Fig. 15f) [20]. The porous tri-layered nanocomposite hydrogel scaffold is composed of chitin‐PLGA, nanobioactive glass 64 ceramic (nBGC), and/or growth factors. In vivo study showed that the cell-free construct completely regenerated the cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone in the periodontal defect. Recent developments in nanocomposites have improved dentistry and oral health care, and will further advance these fields in the near future. However, many obstacles continue to prevent the wider application of nanocomposite biomaterials for clinical use. Future studies should seek to develop nanocomposites capable of efficient cell–matrix interaction, growth factor delivery, and tissue regeneration at sites of dental tissue damage. Figure 15.

Conclusion and perspective As the demand for highly functional materials in biomedical applications increases, use of organic/inorganic hybrid materials has become unavoidable. Hybrid biopolymers and 65 inorganic nanoparticles are attractive because they not only integrate the advantages of each component but also provide synergistic properties. Notably, the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles can impart the extraordinary physical and chemical properties of the inorganic nanomaterial to the polymer matrix and thus compensate for low mechanical strength, a common and significant disadvantage of organic material. Representative organic/inorganic hybrids can be classified into nanoparticles and nanocomposites. Although such hybrid materials have been produced through a range of chemical synthesis methods, the current complex synthetic procedures are difficult to reproduce outside the laboratory at an industrial scale. Therefore, we require organic/inorganic hybrid materials that can be synthesized reproducibly and simply. Additionally, continuing efforts are needed to develop new types of organic/inorganic hybrid materials that overcome the limitations of existing hybrids. Because these organic/inorganic hybrids must be safe enough for clinical translation, they should be synthesized using biocompatible materials. Given the complexity of the physiological environment, more detailed studies of the in vivo behavior of organic/inorganic hybrid materials should be performed, along with well-designed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses. In particular, basic biological studies should be conducted to elucidate the interactions between organic/inorganic hybrid materials and biological components (i.e., proteins, cells, and tissues). The combination of inorganic nanoparticles with imaging modalities and organic polymers capable of drug delivery could be applied to theranostic approaches for various diseases. Exploitation of organic/inorganic hybrid materials in cancer immunotherapy, in conjunction with image guidance, represents a new strategy for improving their therapeutic efficacy. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI)/big data technology can accelerate the development of personalized materials by optimizing combinations of organic and inorganic materials, in line with the emerging idea of precision 66 medicine concept. Furthermore, organic/inorganic hybrid materials are advantageous for use in wearable electronic medical devices, which are attracting increasing attention. Specifically, the electrical, mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of a wearable device could be modulated by manipulating the type and composition of organic and inorganic constituents of its hybrid material components [318, 319]. Finally, multidisciplinary collaboration among experts in materials science and engineering, biotechnology, and medicine is necessary for the clinical application of organic and inorganic hybrid materials. Improvement of organic and inorganic hybrids through multidisciplinary feedback could facilitate the treatment of intractable diseases, thereby contributing significantly to the extension of human lifespan.
