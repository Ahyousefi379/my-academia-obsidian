Herein, we ingeniously fabricated a fully biodegrad- able Magnesium (Mg) based micromotor for the active hydrogen and chemotherapeutics delivery, and ﬁrstly proposed the concept of a self-propelled micromotor platform used for cancer active hydrogen- chemotherapy. By consuming water, the micromotor generates suﬃcient hydrogen in-situ, which is not only propellant for motion, but also active component for hydrogen therapy. The active motion of mi- cromotors with a speed up to 57 ± 19 μm •s − 1 leads to enhanced diffusion of produced hydrogen that allows for higher extracellular and intracellular reducibility. Compared with the non-motor control, the micromotor loaded with doxorubicin improves the chemotherapy eﬃcacy signiﬁcantly by 2.4 times for 4T1 tumor cells with a concentration as low as 100 μg •mL −1 . These results indicate that the Mg-based micromotors can act as self-propelled carriers for enhanced intracellular hydrogen and cancer chemother- apy. Taking advantage of the locally hydrogen generation and the active moving capabilities, the facilely engineered Mg micromotor provides great promise for cancer synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the unsatisﬁed delivery eﬃciency and serious adverse effects of chemotherapeutic agents hinder the cure of cancer [1–3] . Hence, improving the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs and drug delivery eﬃciency become a key is- sue to be considered for cancer therapy [ 4 , 5 ]. Hydrogen (H 2 ), as a kind of endogenous gas with physiological/pathological regulation functions and high bio-safety, has been conﬁrmed as a powerful therapeutic antioxidant that can scavenge cytotoxic oxygen radi- cals of major diseases such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimers and Parkinson’s disease [6–12] . According to the literature, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are commonly found in can- cerous tissues [13] . The increased ROS not only are oncogenic, but also act as signaling molecules for abnormal cell growth, metasta- sis, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis and differentiation block in lung, breast or colon cancer [ 14 , 15 ]. Recent studies have proved ∗ Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: liukun_gdou@163.com (K. Liu), yunruihu@smu.edu.cn (Y. Hu), pengf26@mail.sysu.edu.cn (F. Peng), tuyingfeng1@smu.edu.cn (Y. Tu). that either increase or decrease of rightly overexpressed ROS level in cancer cells could break the redox homoeostasis, thus result- ing in the apoptosis of cancer cells [ 16 , 17 ]. Hence, scavenging ROS could be used as a new strategy for the cancer therapy. It is interesting that H 2 has been conﬁrmed to inhibit the pro- liferation of tumor cells by scavenging ROS and further disturbing the cellular redox homeostasis, without affecting the normal cells [ 6 , 12 , 18 ]. It is commonly accepted that the anti-oxidative H 2 could selectively reduce the highly-oxidative toxic radicals such as hy- droxylradical [ 7 , 9 , 10 , 19–21 ]. Besides, it has been recently reported that H 2 could also down-regulate of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and activate endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as superox- ide dismutase (SOD) and catalase to perform the antioxidant ef- fect [6] . However, the nonpolarity and low solubility of H 2 under the physiological conditions result in limited therapeutic eﬃcacy. To overcome the undesired performance of H 2 , various H 2 carriers including PdH 0.2 nanocrystals, MgB 2 Nanosheet and Fe nanoparti- cles were fabricated to achieve the storage, targeted delivery and controlled release of H 2 [ 18–20 , 22 , 23 ]. However, those approaches rely on H 2 loaded porous nondegradable micro and nanoparticles, which are of limited loading capacity, tissue penetration capabil- ity and biocompatibility. In addition, all the H 2 delivery until now https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2020.100694 2352-9407/© 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 2 K. Liu, J. Ou and S. Wang et al. / Applied Materials Today 20 (2020) 100694 were based on the passive diffusion, which may restrict the disso- lution of H 2 in aqueous solution. Therefore, how to improve the H 2 delivery eﬃcacy is still challenging. Micro-/nanomotors that can convert chemical or physical ener- gies into mechanical motion have attracted considerable attentions for their promising biomedical applications for example diagnosis [ 24 , 25 ], minimally invasive surgery [26–28] , active drug delivery [29–35] . Especially for active drug delivery, the active motion of micro-/nanomotors endowed them huge advantages compared to their passive counterparts [36–40] , which could be suitable per- fectly for improving tumor therapeutic effect [ 30 , 41–47 ]. To take advantage of tumor inhibition from H 2 , the active delivery of H 2 and chemotherapeutics may function as a novel strategy to further improve the synergistic therapeutic effects towards cancer. Among different types of micromotors, the Mg-based Janus mi- cromotors show great potential towards in vivo applications ow- ing to their autonomous propulsion under body ﬂuids, cargo trans- port and release, and their transient biodegradability [48-51] . Com- pared with other transition (Zn, Fe), or alkali metals (Na, Ca), Mg is of particular interest with a tailored degradation behavior un- der physiological or buffer conditions. Hence the speed and mo- tion time of Mg based micromotors can be easily tuned either by ions or the design of micromotor [52] . Moreover, the controllable motion of Mg-based micromotor under blood plasma without any addition of external toxic fuels endows it a fascinating prospect for biomedical application [ 24 , 53 , 54 ]. In our case, most importantly, the capability of self-sacriﬁcing and water-consuming (into H 2 ) al- lows Mg micromotors to be a clean and ideal H 2 generator and the formed H 2 is also the propellant for motion. Here, we demonstrate the design of organic-inorganic hybrid Mg micromotor for enhanced active and synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy ( Scheme 1 ). Biodegradable micromotors were fabri- cated by using Mg microparticles as templates and subsequently coating with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) asymmetrically, which is promising for drug delivery due to its degradable char- acteristics and improved drug loading capacity. The H 2 produced by Mg-water reaction was able to achieve enhanced diffusion due to the motion of micromotors, offering possibility for en- hanced ROS scavenging (special for •OH) ( Scheme 1 C). By using Mg micromotors for active and synergistic hydrogen chemother- apy, an outstanding performance towards tumor cells was achieved ( Scheme 1 D). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Mg microparticles (catalog FMW20; average size: 25 μm) were purchased from TangShan WeiHao Magnesium Powder Co. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA, 80 0 0 Da) was bought from Jinan Daigang Biomaterial Co., Ltd. CellROX oxidative stress reagents (green) was purchased from Life Technologies Co. Methylene blue (MB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), doxorubicin (DOX), methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 2, 7-dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), calcein O, O- diacetate tetrakis (acetoxymethyl) ester/propidium iodide (calcein- AM/PI) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology. Human colon cancer cell line (HT29) and rat breast cancer cell line (4T1), obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), were used as model cancer cells to evaluate the active and synergistic hydrogen chemotherapy of Mg based motors. All reagents for cell culture were bought from Gibco. All other chemical regents used in this experiment were analyti- cally pure without further puriﬁcation. 2.2. Instruments Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded on a Phenom emission scanning electron microscope. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element analysis was carried out with an EDX analyzer (mounted on the Phenom FEI-SEM Pharos) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Nikon Ti2-A inversion ﬂuorescence microscope were used to capture cell morphology and motion of Mg-motor. A Multi-function plate reader (Tecan, Inﬁnite M10 0 0 Pro, Swiss) was used to detect the cell ﬂuorescence intensity. 2.3. Fabrication of Mg-motor and Mg-plga microparticles Fabrication of Mg-motor: Mg microparticles were used as the core to prepare Mg-based micromotors (named as Mg-motor). The Mg microparticles were initially washed with acetone to remove the impurities, then dried under N 2 ﬂow. Subsequently, 1 mg of Mg microparticles were dispersed onto a glass slide precoated with a thin ﬁlm of poly(vinylpyrrolidinone) (PVP). After that, the formed Mg microparticles layer were coated with PLGA or the mixture of PLGA and DOX in ethyl acetate. The resulting Mg-motors were scraped carefully from the glass slide. The DOX loaded Mg-motor was named as Mg-motor-DOX. Fabrication of Mg-PLGA microparticles: The same prewashing method as mentioned in 2.1 was used to fabricate Mg-PLGA mi- croparticles that couldn’t release hydrogen. Firstly, 100 μL of PVP ethyl alcohol solution (2 mg •mL −1 ) was casted on a glass slide to form a thin ﬁlm, followed by adding 60 μL of PLGA ethyl acetate solution (1 w/w%). Subsequently, 1 mg of Mg microparticles were dispersed onto the thin layer of PLGA, then another 60 μL of PLGA solution was added, so as to fabricate well encapsulated Mg-PLGA microparticles. The DOX loaded Mg-PLGA microparticle was named as Mg-PLGA-DOX. 2.4. Characterization of Mg-motor Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained by a Phenom LE instrument (Phenom, Eindhoven, Netherlands) with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) element mapping was acquired by an EDX detector mounted on the Phenom FEI-SEM Pharos with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and analyzed by ProSuite software. Before measurement, all samples were attached onto the conductive adhesives, then coated with platinum using a Quorum Q150V Plus ion sputtering system (Quorum Technologies Co., Ltd, Laughton, United Kingdom). Bight- ﬁeld and ﬂuorescent images of the Mg-motors were captured by Nikon microscope coupled with × 20 microscope objectives and ﬂuorescence ﬁlter for red light excitation. The ﬂuorescence and bright-ﬁled images of Mg motor (stained with Nile red) were cap- tured on Nikon Ti2-A inversion ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Instrument Inc.). 2.5. Motion of Mg-motor The RPMI 1640 culture medium for HT29 and 4T1 cells was used as main solution of the simulated body ﬂuid (SBF). And the movements of Mg-motor were evaluated in SBF supplemented with 0.3 M NaHCO 3 and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C to character the mo- tion trajectory. A Nikon Ti2-A inverted optical microscope equipped with a high-speed camera (Nikon, DS-Qi2) and NIS Elements AR 3.2 software was used to observe and record the motion of Mg- motor with 10 frames per second (time interval between each frames \u0002T = 100 ms). Tracking image sequences were analyzed with Image J plugin manual tracking according to the previous re- port [55] . At least 25 micromotors were tracked to calculate the av- erage speeds. K. Liu, J.

Measurement of the ROS level in cells Measure intracellular ROS level by DCFH-DA probes: HT29 or 4T1 cells were seeded onto 96-well plate with density of 5 × 10 3 cells per well and cultivated in 100 μL RPMI 1640 culture medium. Af- ter 24 h, the culture medium was replaced by the fresh serum- free one containing the pure Mg microparticles with a series con- centration of 0, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 μg •mL −1 and NaHCO 3 (0.3 M). After incubated for 2 h, the medium was removed and each well was washed with the fresh serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium to remove residual samples. Then, the DCFH-DA probes (100 μL, 10 μM) was added into each well and the re- sulting 96-well plate was monitored by a multi-mode microplate reader (excitation/emission = 488/525 nm). The ﬂuorescence im- ages of the two cells were obtained using an invert microscope af- ter removing medium and washing three times with PBS. Measure intracellular ROS level by CellROX probes: HT29 cells (2 × 10 5 mL −1 ) or 4T1 cells (1 × 10 5 mL −1 ) were seeded onto 12-well plate and cultivated in RPMI 1640 culture medium. Af- ter 48 h, the culture medium was replaced by fresh serum-free ones containing the prepared samples with ﬁnal concentrations of 300 μg •mL −1 and NaHCO 3 (0.3 M). After incubated for 6 h, the medium was removed and each well was washed with the fresh serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium to remove residual sam- ples. Then, the CellROX probes (200 μL, 5 μM) was added, and in- cubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then remove medium and wash the cells for 3 times with PBS, and ﬁx the cells with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. After washing 3 times with PBS, the cells were stained by an antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI. The ROS changing of the cells was analyzed by using an Olympus ﬂuorescent micro- scope. 2.7. Measurement of DOX uptake eﬃcacy of cancer cell HT29 or 4T1 cells with density of 1 × 10 4 cells per well were seeded onto 24-well plates and cultivated in RPMI 1640 for 48 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was replaced by fresh serum-free ones containing Mg-motor-DOX and Mg-PLGA- DOX (150 μg •mL −1 ) and NaHCO 3 (0.3 mol •L −1 ) and co-cultured for 6 h. Then the cells were washed with PBS for 3 times before staining with DAPI (ﬁnal concentration 10 μg •mL −1 , 10 min). Fi- nally, the cell were washed with PBS and the ﬂuorescence images were captured on Nikon Ti2-A inversion ﬂuorescence microscope. 2.8. Cytotoxicity analysis HT29 or 4T1 cells with density of 5 × 10 3 cells per well were seeded onto 96-well plates and cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. Then the cells were incubated respectively with Mg- motor-DOX, Mg-motor, Mg-PLGA-DOX, Mg and Mg-PLGA in RPMI 4 K. Liu, J. Ou and S. Wang et al. / Applied Materials Today 20 (2020) 100694 Fig. 1.

After another 24 h incubation, the medium was carefully removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Sub- sequently, 110 μL MTT in fresh culture medium (0.5 mg •mL −1 ) was added. After incubation for 4 h, the culture medium was care- fully removed, and 100 μL DMSO was added per well, followed by 10 min shaking on a horizontal shaker. Biotek 800 TS plate reader was used to measure the absorbance at 490 nm. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Fabrication and characterization of Mg micromotors Mg microparticles were ﬁrst imbedded onto the PVP ﬁlm and further encapsulated with biodegradable PLGA [56] . After being scraped from the plates, a loophole was formed on one side of the resulting Mg microsphere. According to the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the pure Mg microparticles exhibited a spherical structure with an average size of 23 ± 5 μm (Fig. S1a- c, Supporting Information). While after PLGA coating, the formed Mg micromotors (named as Mg-motor) displayed a spherical ge- ometry with a small circular opening ( Fig. 1 A and B). Compared with the pure Mg microparticles, the Mg-motor was demonstrated a larger size (27 ± 5 μm, Fig. S1i, Supporting Information) ow- ing to the coated PLGA shell. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results in Fig. 1 B illustrated the presence and elemental distribution of Mg from the core and C and O from PLGA shell within the micromotor structure. The pure Mg microparticle ex- hibited a smooth surface with less carbon covered when com- pared with that of micromotor (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). The typical Janus structure of the Mg-motor could be attributed to the partial Mg microparticles embedded in the PVP ﬁlms on glass slides during PLGA coating. Due to the polymeric structure, hydrophobic Nile red or antitumor drug DOX was loaded into PLGA shell respectively, which further conﬁrmed the asymmetric distri- bution of polymer layer on the Mg microparticles ( Fig. 1 C and D). The loading eﬃciency of DOX, calculated according to the stan- dard curve of DOX (Fig. S3a, Supporting Information), was 33.61 μg •mg −1 (Fig. S3b, Supporting Information). In our work, the small opening of the Mg-motor could act as Mg-water reaction inter- face for H 2 generation under the gastric and intestine ﬂuid or even serum environment, therefore resulting in the autonomous motion.

Motion of Mg micromotors After conﬁrming the structure, we next evaluated the motion of the Mg-motor under SBF. According to the previous reports, the mobility of the micromotors could be affected by environmental factors such as components, viscosity and temperature [57] . When using nano/micromotors for purpose of biomedicine, the compli- cated component of bioﬂuid could affect the motion behaviours of nano/micromotors [58–61] . Therefore, to precisely evaluate the motion enhanced H 2 and DOX delivery in cultured cancer cells, we chose the cell culture medium as the basic media to mimic the SBF environment. The schematic image in Fig. 2 A illustrated that the continuous H 2 generation could propel Mg-motor to achieve au- tonomous motion in SBF. An invert microscopy was used to record the trajectory of the Mg-motor, which displayed different motion behaviors, such as spiral or linear mode ( Fig. 2 B-C; captured from Videos S1 and S2, Supporting Information). Image J with manual tracking module was further applied to analyze the trajectory path and the motion characteristics including average velocity, direc- tionality, and accumulate distance ( Fig. 2 E). Owing to the grad- ual Mg depletion in SBF, the Mg-motor displayed a lifetime of ≈ 4.5 min with an average speed up to 57 ± 19 μm •s −1 . It was noted that once the Mg core was fully depleted (i.e., completion of the Mg-proton reaction as shown in Video S3, Supporting Infor- mation), the Mg-motor stopped only with PLGA shell left (Fig. S4, Supporting Information), as illustrated in the corresponding Video S4 (Supporting Information). 3.3. Assessment of active hydrogen released by Mg micromotors To evaluate the controlled release and bio-reductivity of H 2 in SBF, MB was used as an oxidative probe for H 2 detection. Gener- ally, MB can react with H 2 in the presence of Pt (Pt nanoparticles 50 nm, Fig. S5, Supporting Information) to produce colorless re- duced leucomethylene blue (leucoMB) according to the followed equation [62] : MB ( blue ) +2 H + +2 e − → leucoMB ( colorless ) (1) Therefore, the color fading of MB was used to quantify the re- lease of reductive H 2 from Mg microparticle, Mg-motor and Mg- PLGA respectively (Fig. S6, Supporting Information). As for the pure Mg microparticle, the absorbance of MB at 644 nm was sharply decreased in 20 min then increased afterwards, indicating the fast H 2 releasing (Fig. S7a, Supporting Information) owing to the rapid degradation of Mg in SBF. While for Mg-motor, it lasted for 40 min which was two times longer than that of Mg micropar- ticle (Fig. S7b, Supporting Information). The prolonged and con- trolled H 2 release from Mg-motor was attributed to the gradual Mg depletion from the Janus structure. Besides, the well encap- sulated Mg-PLGA microparticles exhibited a extremely lower H 2 release (Fig. S7c, Supporting Information). The intracellular reduc- tivity of H 2 released from Mg-motor were also tested by the MB- Pt probe. As shown in Fig. S8 (Supporting Information), both 4T1 and HT29 stained with MB showed deep blue at 0 min. While the color was sharply decreased in 60 min then slightly increased af- terwards (120 min) after incubating with Mg-motor. The decrease in color demonstrated that active H 2 release was possible to across cytomembrane and penetrate into cells, indicating the signiﬁcant intracellular time-dependent bio-reductivity of Mg-motor. Considering the bio-reducibility of H 2 , the overexpressed ROS (especial for hydroxyl radical) in tumor cells could be eliminated by the active H 2 produced by Mg-motor. Fig. 3 A shows schemat- ically the experimental design of motion enhanced intracellular ROS scavenging. Fluorogenic ROS probe (CellROX Green reagent) was used to measure the ROS level in both two model cells. The cell-permeable CellROX is nonﬂuorescent in its reduced state while it binds onto DNA and becomes ﬂuorescence upon oxidation. As shown in Fig. 3 B-IV and 3E-IV, Mg-motor showed the highest ROS 6 K. Liu, J. Ou and S. Wang et al. / Applied Materials Today 20 (2020) 100694 Fig. 3. Enhanced ROS scavenging ability of Mg-motor.

( ∗ p < 0.05). scavenging ability in both HT29 and 4T1 cells due to the motion enhanced H 2 diffusion and dissolution in aqueous as illustrated in Fig. S8 (Supporting Information). To further evaluate the ROS scavenging ability of Mg-motor, another ROS probe (DCFH-DA) was used to detect the intracellular ROS level. It should be noted that DCFH-DA can also permeate into cell, then be degraded by intra- cellular lipase and converted into DCFH. The formed DCFH can be further oxidized into ﬂuorescent DCF, which has a positive correla- tion with intracellular ROS level. The ﬂuorescence intensity of Mg- motor and Mg microparticles showed a signiﬁcant decrease in both two cells ( Fig. 3 C-D, Fig. S9 in Supporting Information). It should be noted that Mg-motor exhibited over 12 times ROS scavenge ef- ﬁcacy than that of the passive microparticles (Fig. S10, Support- ing Information). According to previous reports, H 2 could break re- dox homoeostasis, leading to the apotosis of cancer cells [ 6 , 20 , 22 ]. Hence, it is fascinating that the stronger ROS scanvenge ability of Mg-motor by delivering active H 2 could be a new stragey for can- cer therapy. 3.4. Synergistic therapeutic effect of Mg motors in vitro The motion of Mg-motor can be used not only to deliver active H 2 as we discussed above, but also to improve the drug delivery eﬃcacy [52] . To verify synergistic therapeutic effect of Mg motors by coupling active delivery of H 2 and chemotherapeutic drug, DOX, which could inhibit the growth of tumor by interfering the func- tion of DNA by inhibiting activity of topoisomerase II, has been chosen as the model drug loaded on the Mg-motor. After incubat- ing with Mg-motor-DOX for 6 h, the intracellular uptake of DOX by two tumor cells was evaluated respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 A- B, the intracellular DOX ﬂuorescence was signiﬁcantly increased in both 4T1 and HT29 cells, indicating that the motion of the micro- motor could promote the uptake of DOX eﬃciently. While much less ﬂuorescence was observed in HT29 cells, probably because of the difference between various tumor cells [ 63 , 64 ]. The semiquan- titative analysis of intracellular DOX ( Fig. 4 C-D) was further calcu- lated three times by Image J to obtain the average value of ﬂuores- cence intensity (see Supporting Information). It was interesting to ﬁnd that the ﬂuorescence intensity of DOX in 4T1 and HT29 cells was improved more than 17 and 5 times respectively when com- pared with non-motor groups (Mg-PLGA-DOX). Calcein-AM /PI kit was further used to test the ratio between living and death cells after treatment. The strongest red ﬂuorescence (dead cells) was observed after incubating with Mg-motor-DOX due to combined hydrogenchemical therapy. (Fig. S11, Supporting Information) This suggested that the hydrogen chemotherapy had greater suppres- sion on tumor cells, particularly for 4T1 cells, which could be as- cribed to enhanced DOX therapeutic eﬃcacy induced by synergistic effects of the active drug delivery and sustained hydrogen release. We further evaluated the therapeutic effect of active hydrogen- chemical therapy on both HT29 and 4T1 cells ( Fig. 4 E-F). No sig- niﬁcant cytotoxicity was observed for Mg-PLGA (without H 2 pro- duction), Mg microparticles (passive H 2 delivery), Mg-motor (ac- tive H 2 delivery) and Mg-PLGA-DOX (single chemotherapy) when the Mg concentration was lower than 100 mg •mL −1 . However, lowest viability in both cancer cell lines especially for 4T1 cells was demonstrated when incubating with Mg-motor-DOX. ( Fig. 4 E- F) HT29 cells were less sensitive to DOX than 4T1 cells, which could be attributed to the drug resistance of cancer cells [63] . When the concentration of Mg-motor-DOX increased from 50 to 100 μg •mL −1 (DOX concentration was 1.5 to 3.0 μg •mL −1 accord- ingly), the viability of 4T1 cell decreased sharply from 92.37% to 31.00%, which exhibited remarkably improved cytotoxicity com- pared with DOX and other DOX loaded nanodrugs reported pre- viously [65–74] . While for Mg-PLGA-DOX (non-motor), the viabil- ity decreased slightly from 91.34% (50 μg •mL −1 ) to 75.43% (100 K. Liu, J. Ou and S. Wang et al. / Applied Materials Today 20 (2020) 100694 7 Fig. 4.

The huge difference in cell viability bewteen motor and non-motor groups demonstrated a signiﬁcantly improved thera- peutic effects due to the active H 2 induced enhanced sensitivity of cancer cells to DOX, indicating the superiority of combined active H 2 and enhanced chemotherapy. According to the results displayed above, it was obvious that such synergistic anticancer effects could be valuable to improve cancer therapeutic eﬃcacy in future. 4. Conclusion In summary, we demonstrated a facile approach for engineering a fully biodegradable Mg micromotor based H 2 generating system for active hydrogen chemotherapy for the ﬁrst time. By consum- ing water in local biological environment, the designed Mg mi- cromotors were able to propel in SBF eﬃciently. This leads to a controlled generation and enhanced diffusion of H 2 which allowed for higher intracellular ROS scavenging and redox homoeostasis re-establishment. The locally produced H 2 by Mg micromotors could further improve the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemother- apy. Due to the self-propulsion, Mg micromotors exhibited much higher drug delivery eﬃciency, resulting in enhanced chemother- apeutic eﬃcacy. The concept of Mg micromotor based active hy- drogenchemical therapy represent a concrete step towards clin- ical translation of hydrogen-chemo antitumor therapy.
