Previous studies have mostly focused on near room temperature (300 K) and cryogenic temperature (<10 K) ranges, while important applications such as hydrogen liquefaction call for efficient magnetic refrigerants for the intermediate temperature range of 10–100 K. For efficient use in this range, new magnetocaloric materials with matching Curie temperatures need to be discovered, while conventional experimental approaches are typically time-consuming and expensive. Here, we report a computational material discovery pipeline based on a materials database containing more than 6000 entries auto-generated by extracting reported material properties from the literature using a large language model. We then use this database to train a machine learning model that can efficiently predict the magnetocaloric properties of materials based on their chemical composition. We further verify the magnetocaloric properties of the predicted compounds using ab initio atomistic spin dynamics simulations to complete the computational material discovery. Using this approach, we identify 11 new promising magnetocaloric materials for the target temperature range. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining large language models, machine learning, and ab initio simulations to efficiently discover new functional materials. © 2024 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION Solid-state refrigeration is a groundbreaking avenue driven by the pressing need for more sustainable and efficient cooling technologies. 1–4 Specifically, magnetic refrigeration shows promise in solid-state cooling applications across a wide temperature range. Magnetic refrigeration is based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE), where the entropy of a magnetic material (the “magnetic refrigerant”) is controlled by an external magnetic field.1 When an external magnetic field is applied, the microscopic magnetic moments are aligned with the field. As a result, the entropy asso- ciated with the magnetic moments in the material is reduced. In the process, either heat is released under an isothermal condition or the temperature of the magnetic refrigerant is increased under an adi- abatic condition. When the magnetic field is removed, the effect is reversed. These processes can be combined to form a thermody- namic cooling cycle, whose cooling capacity is determined by the isothermal magnetocaloric entropy change (ΔSM) and the adiabatic temperature change (ΔTad) during the magnetization and demag- netization processes. This cycle resembles a Carnot cycle on the S-T diagram, promising close-to-ideal efficiency.5 Compared with other cooling technologies, magnetic refrigeration has attracted renewed interest, thanks to its solid-state nature, cryogen-free oper- ation, reliability, compactness, and capability to reach close-to- Carnot efficiency at cryogenic temperatures.6 For these reasons, magnetic refrigeration has been widely applied for applications in AIP Advances 14, 085125 (2024); doi: 10.1063/5.0206855 14, 085125-1 © Author(s) 2024 26 May 2025 11:30:13 AIP Advances ARTICLE pubs.aip.org/aip/adv space missions,7 in scientific instrumentation,8 and as an environ- mentally friendly alternative to vapor compression-based cooling.9 However, most previous investigations of magnetic refrigeration have focused on either cryogenic temperatures below a few K or near room temperature, while many technologically important applica- tions require efficient cooling in the temperature range between 10 and 100 K, such as hydrogen and methane liquefaction10 and cryogenic carbon capture.11 To achieve efficient magnetic refrigeration in this temperature range, one key requirement is to identify new high-performance magnetic refrigerants with their Curie temperature (TC) in this range since both ΔSM and ΔTad are typically maximized near TC. Therefore, TC signifies the ideal working temperature for an MCE material and stands as a crucial parameter for identifying new magnetic refrigerants. In addition, large magnetic moments and favorable exchange interactions12 are fundamental prerequi- sites for a material to exhibit favorable MCE characteristics. In this context, rare-earth-based alloys are state-of-the-art candidates for magnetocaloric refrigeration in the intermediate temperature range. For example, heavy rare-earth-based MCE materials, such as HoB2,13,14 ErCo2,15 DyAl2,16,17 and ErAl2,16 exhibit significant ΔSM and ΔTad values in this temperature range due to their large magnetic moments. Consequently, they are actively researched for applications such as hydrogen liquefaction because their TC is within the required range.18–20 Their typical isothermal entropy change ΔSM is around 20–30 J kg−1 K−1 and adiabatic temperature change ΔTad is around 10 K for an applied magnetic field of 5 T. Historically, these MCE materials were discovered mainly through an experimen- tal synthesis and characterization process, which can be expensive and time-consuming, and often relies on trial and error. To make further progress, more efficient methods to discover and verify new high-performance MCE materials are needed for refrigeration applications in various temperature ranges. Along this line, high-throughput computational material searches were previ- ously conducted.21,22 For example, Bocarsly et al. used the strength of spin-lattice coupling in a material, which can be effectively eval- uated at the ground-state density functional theory (DFT) level, as a proxy to search for new magnetocaloric materials.21 In addition, previous studies have used various machine learning-based meth- ods to predict suitable candidates for magnetic refrigeration from the aspects of compositional and structural changes23 and optimiza- tion to enhance key performance metrics while reducing material cost. 24,25 Suitable candidates such as HoB2 and Co-doped Fe2P-type compounds were identified for this purpose by data mining and machine learning. 13,26 However, these pioneering studies have been limited with respect to the size of accessible MCE datasets and have lacked an efficient way to verify the MCE performance of predicted materials. As a result, new MCE materials of practical value that have been identified through these approaches have been limited. In the realm of materials science, there is a vast and expand- ing collection of unstructured data in the form of journal articles, patents, and theses. This accumulation and rapid publication pace overwhelm researchers’ ability to fully utilize the available informa- tion. Converting these data into structured material databases would facilitate data-driven research aimed at discovering new materi- als, yet manual compilation is not only labor-intensive but also susceptible to errors. Fortunately, advancements in natural lan- guage processing (NLP) have enabled the automated extraction of data from extensive document collections, paving the way for cre- ating detailed materials property databases and discovering new materials.27,28 For example, in a previous study, Court and Cole established an auto-generated database of 39 822 records contain- ing magnetic materials and their associated Curie or Néel magnetic phase transition temperatures using NLP to extract relevant infor- mation from the literature.29 In a subsequent study, they used an NLP toolkit to generate a materials database from the published lit- erature containing 2910 entries with their MCE properties and then used the data to train a deep neural network to predict the MCE properties of new materials.30 They identified six new promising MCE materials with this innovative approach. However, the vali- dation of their results still relied on experiments, which can be a bottleneck of the pipeline. Two recent advancements have provided new opportunities to further improve the pipeline proposed by Court et al.30 to effi- ciently and accurately identify new MCE materials. One is the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), particularly those in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series,31 which have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text and have also introduced advanced features such as summarizing articles, generating informative charts, and mapping relationships between words. The emergence of LLMs enables efficient extraction of material properties from a large amount of published literature. 32,33 The other development is com- putational methods based on atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simu- lations with exchange interaction coefficients computed from first principles.12,34,35 These methods allow an accurate evaluation of MCE properties based solely on the crystal structure and chemical composition of materials and can validate the findings in high- throughput and machine learning-based computational material searches. In this work, we exploit GPT’s remarkable abilities to summa- rize texts to complete an auto-generated MCE materials database with 6615 entries based on openly accessible abstracts of the pub- lished literature. After careful curation and validation, we used high-quality data from the database to train a neural network that can predict the isothermal entropy change in ferromagnetic mate- rials with high fidelity only based on their chemical composition. With this neural network model, we efficiently screened binary and ternary magnetic compounds in the large online database, the Materials Project,36 and identified a list of promising MCE materi- als that have not been studied before. Finally, we used DFT-based first-principles simulation and ASD to evaluate the MCE properties of the top-ranked candidates predicted by the neural network and identified 11 new promising MCE materials for the less explored intermediate temperature range (10–100 K). Importantly, the cal- culated results can potentially be added back to the MCE database, which can further improve the performance of the neural network. A schematic of our workflow is shown in Fig. 1, with more detailed information about each key step summarized in Fig. 2. Our work demonstrates the vast potential of using LLMs to extract structured information from the published literature and utilize the extracted data to drive new discoveries of functional materials.

Flowchart of the magnetocaloric material discovery pipeline. Existing literature is analyzed by a large language model to generate a database containing the MCE properties of a large number of materials. The database is then curated and refined to serve as the training dataset for a machine learning model. The machine learning model is then used to screen materials in the Materials Project database to identify new promising MCE materials, whose properties are verified by ab initio DFT and ASD simulations. The simulation results can potentially be added back to the materials database to refine the process. FIG. 2. Detailed information on the key steps of the magnetocaloric material discovery pipeline. II. METHODS A. Database creation using GPT To further the discovery of new MCE materials through machine learning, it is crucial to establish a comprehensive and high- quality database containing the MCE properties of materials that can then be used as the training dataset for a machine learning model. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of LLMs, particularly with the introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022, offers a promising solution to automatically generate a database based on the large body of published literature.37 The process for creating our MCE database using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model by OpenAI is detailed below: 1. Data collection We began by selecting the first 8000 most relevant abstracts from the Web of Science from more than 350 journals, ranking all scientific papers by their relevance to the MCE properties of mate- rials. The time span of the publication date extends from 1993 to 2023. These abstracts were then converted into CSV files containing both the text of the abstract and publication details. To stream- line this process, we focused on papers that provided useful data, such as those containing one or more chemical compounds and their corresponding MCE properties expressed in numerical values. To reduce the number of records to a more tractable quantity for AIP Advances 14, 085125 (2024); doi: 10.1063/5.0206855 14, 085125-3 © Author(s) 2024 26 May 2025 11:30:13 AIP Advances ARTICLE pubs.aip.org/aip/adv further analysis, we developed a filter pipeline that employs prompts to determine the potential usefulness of data within an abstract. This filtering process is both accurate and efficient as commercialized LLMs such as GPT can readily identify the presence of chemical compounds or numerical values in the text. Abstracts that only offer general descriptions or values without specific materials were excluded. 2. Prompt engineering and self-examination Utilizing OpenAI’s LLM API, we transformed abstracts into tables, highlighting material compositions and their properties. This involved using a multi-shot prompt strategy, 38,39 which increases the accuracy of data extraction by providing the LLM with mul- tiple examples. The tables generated were generally accurate. GPT models, like other LLM models, exhibit a phenomenon called hal- lucination, wherein they can generate low-likelihood outputs that deviate from the expected output based on the input context and the true data distribution.40 To address this potential issue, we applied a self-examination pipeline that aims to reduce the likelihood of errors due to hallucinations, such as the inclusion of unmentioned materials, overlooking properties, or confusing property names. The self-examination process involves an additional prompt to ver- ify the consistency between the generated table and the original abstract, specifically to counteract the LLM’s tendency to make edu- cated guesses by removing numerical values not provided in the abstract. These steps were conducted separately, guiding the LLM to focus on task reasoning rather than relying on its vast knowledge base. 3. Filtering after natural language processing After extracting relevant material formulations and MCE prop- erties from the literature using GPT, we established a database with MCE properties for 6615 materials. Starting from this collection, we refined the dataset by filtering out organic materials and alloyed materials to limit our material discovery process to intrinsic inor- ganic materials as the starting step, which leads to a reduced database with 1426 entries. In principle, however, the material search can be expanded later to include more complex materials in our future work. 4. Database creation and mapping to the materials project Our objective was to create a one-to-one match between the materials listed in our filtered database and those cataloged in the esteemed Materials Project (MP) database.36 This approach was cho- sen because the MP database provides a wealth of physical properties data (notably, without the MCE properties), which, when combined with our MCE data, facilitates their use in machine learning for materials discovery. Ultimately, we successfully matched 752 mate- rials in our database with their corresponding Material Project IDs. To enhance accessibility and utility, we developed an HTML version of the database.41 This allows users to efficiently search for reported MCE materials using various criteria, such as chemical elements, or to organize materials by their name, MCE properties, or Curie temperatures. 4. Evaluation We manually reviewed 200 randomly chosen samples from each test set to assess the database’s accuracy. The database was esti- mated to have an accuracy of around 90%. A record is considered valid only if the name of one material matches the correct magne- tocaloric entropy change (ΔSM) and TC values cited in the input scientific text. Information about our database is summarized in Table I. B. Machine learning model construction and training Our next step is to train a machining learning model using the database constructed by the LLM to predict MCE properties of materials based on their chemical composition. One challenge arises: the reported ΔSM values were measured across varying magnetic field strengths in different papers, rendering them incomparable. To address this, we implemented a linear scaling based on a com- monly used field strength of 5 T to approximate the field dependence of ΔSM, as established in measurements.42 This linear extrapola- tion represents another necessary trade-off between accuracy and efficiency and may lead to inaccurate estimations of ΔSM in cer- tain magnetocaloric compounds. Luckily, we estimate that the linear extrapolation is only needed in a small fraction of compounds (roughly 10%), while it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the impact of this operation on the performance of our material-search framework. Another issue is that the dataset contains a notable num- ber of duplicates due to measurements by different groups or at TABLE I. Information about the created and filtered MCE databases.

We kept the maximum value among the duplicates after scaling to make ΔSM values consistent for training. To leverage data efficiency and model complexity, we limited the training data to include only materials with less than or equal to eight atoms in the unit cell, resulting in 229 unique materials in the training set. Given the relatively small size of the training set, train- ing a machine model to accurately predict the numerical values of ΔSM is unrealistic. Instead, we aim to train a machine learning model to compare and rank materials based on their magnetocaloric per- formance (ΔSM). We adopted a feedforward neural network with three hidden layers, each with 16 neurons. The optimal network structure was determined via a grid search of different numbers of layers and neurons per layer. Details of the process can be found in supplementary material Sec. I B. The input vector contains four features, with a total vector size of 11: 8 integers representing the atoms in the unit cell and three floats for volume, density, and total magnetization, respectively, which can be extracted from the Mate- rials Project database. In general, neural networks require larger amounts of high-quality training data, enabling them to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. In our case, a major chal- lenge is that we achieved high training data quality at the expense of the total number of records. In this study, we tackled this by employing data augmentation. Since the order of atomic numbers in the vector representation can be arbitrary, permutations of atomic numbers essentially represent the same material. Hence, we shuf- fled the elements of the atomic number vector to create multiple representations and augment the size of the training set. In the model, we generated 100 “representations” of each unique material as training data. Test runs that validated the proof of concept are included in supplementary material Figs. S2 and S3. The training process aims to minimize the mean squared error (MSE), which is more susceptible to outliers because it penalizes larger errors more significantly. In this context, MSE is suitable for the purpose of identifying candidates with large ΔSM values. Standard- ization is applied to the dataset, which is a common preprocessing step in machine learning to help with algorithm convergence. It ensures that each column of input features and output has zero mean and unit variance. The target of the model, standardized ΔSM val- ues, is directly used to rank the candidate materials. The predictions can be converted back to the original scale by inverse transforma- tion. Figure 3 presents the training curves and an evaluation of the adopted model. The first two panels show the loss function (MSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) of the training process, indicat- ing the model’s accuracy and convergence. Notably, the consistently low values of both MSE and MAE across the panels affirm the robustness and accuracy of the adopted model. The third panel illus- trates the correlation between predicted ΔSM and true ΔSM values of the dataset, showing the model’s predictive capabilities. For each data point, the atomic number vector of the input representation was shuffled ten times, and the average of the ten predictions was plotted. A high correlation coefficient of 0.99 underscores a strong alignment between the predicted values by the neural network and the ground truth. This impressive correlation emphasizes the model’s reliability in capturing patterns within the data and reinforces its suitability for accurate predictions. We executed the model ten times to assess the consistency of rankings and produce the final ranking. The ranking from each run is recorded in a sorted list for each material, and this sorted list is used for the final ranking based on its length and each ranking. We evaluated the model performance by the “recall” of the ranked list.43 Recall is a performance metric in machine learning that mea- sures the true positive rate of a model’s prediction. In other words, it measures the proportion of actual positive cases that the model correctly identifies as positive. For example, “recall@10” measures, among the top ten candidates predicted by the model, the percent- age that accurately aligns with the top ten candidates according to the ground truth. Table II shows the recall when considering the top K candidates. “Max ranking” indicates the number of top candidates considered in producing the sorted list, which can only be smaller or equal to K. By examining the recalls at various K values, it becomes evident that our model demonstrates consistent performance across different ranking strategies. C. DFT and ASD simulations Once new promising MCE materials are predicted by the machine learning model, we use DFT and ASD simulations to directly compute their MCE properties (ΔSM and ΔTad) and verify FIG. 3.

For each mag- netic material, the magnetic exchange energies (Jij) were estimated with DFT calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on the projected augmented wave pseudopotentials.44 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof form of generalized gradient approx- imation (PBE-GGA)45 was used for structural optimization. All of our calculations utilized a plane-wave cut-off energy of 600 eV. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to be 1 × 10−5 and 0.01 eV/Å, respectively. A Monkhorst–Pack46 k-point grid of (20 × 20 × 20) was employed for cubic GdMg, and a similar density of k-point grids was utilized to sample the Brillouin zone for all other compounds. The robust correlation among the localized ‘ f’ electrons was systematically addressed via GGA + U calculations. Specifically, the parameters U and J were set to 7 and 1 eV, respectively, for all rare-earth elements in our calculations as these values are commonly used in the literature.47,48 Three nearest-neighbor Jij values were esti- mated in each case and subsequently utilized for ASD simulations in further steps. The parameterized atomistic spin model was employed for ASD simulations using VAMPIRE simulation software.49 To deter- mine TC, the Monte Carlo method was utilized. This involved executing 10 000 steps at each temperature, allowing the system of 30 × 30 × 30 unit cells with in-plane periodic boundary conditions to reach equilibrium. Subsequently, a statistical average was obtained over 10 000 steps to extract the mean magnetization. Temperature- dependent magnetization curves were calculated by employing the spin dynamics approach and the Heun integration scheme.50 In addition, the demagnetization field induced by the atomistic spins themselves was accounted for. The external magnetic field was sys- tematically increased to 5 T with an incremental step of 1 T. The ASD simulation was conducted to generate the magnetization vs temperature (M vs T) curves. Figure 4 represents the M vs T curves for three representative materials, i.e., EuB6, EuLiH3, and GdMg. From these temperature-dependent magnetization curves, TC values were estimated by fitting the curves with M(T) = (1 − T TC )β, where β is the critical exponent. The M vs T curves for fields ranging from 0 to 5 T were calculated with steps of 1 T to evaluate ΔSM using the Maxwell relation,1 ΔSM = μ0∫ H f Hi ( ∂M ∂T )HdH, (1) where Hi and H f represent the initial and final magnetic fields, respectively, and μ0 denotes the Bohr magneton. To evaluate the accuracy of the ASD simulation in predicting ΔSM of magne- tocaloric compounds containing rare earth elements, we compared the ΔSM values calculated with ASD to experimentally reported values in several representative compounds (listed in Table S1 in the supplementary material). As can be seen, the simulated values, although not exactly matching the experimental values, provide a reasonable indication of the magnetocaloric response. Given its rel- atively low computational cost, our DFT + ASD approach provides a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for a high- throughput material search. Ultimately, promising materials found using our simulations should be checked experimentally. For further evaluation of the MCE performance of the pre- dicted compounds, the total specific heat (CT) was estimated as a combination of phononic (Cp), magnonic (Cm), and electronic (Ce) contributions, i.e., CT = Cm + Cp + Ce. (2) First, we begin with the magnetic energy (U) of the magnetic compound to calculate Cm i.e., U = −∑ ij λij ⃗Ji ⋅ ⃗Jj − ∑ i gμB ⃗Ji ⋅ h ext, (3) where the first term represents the spin–spin exchange interaction, λij is the exchange interaction parameter, and Ji is the total angular momentum of the magnetic ions. The second term represents the Zeeman interaction of the total angular momentum with an external FIG. 4. Simulated temperature and field-dependent magnetization in three representative compounds predicted by the machine learning model. AIP Advances 14, 085125 (2024); doi: 10.1063/5.0206855 14, 085125-6 © Author(s) 2024 26 May 2025 11:30:13 AIP Advances ARTICLE pubs.aip.org/aip/adv magnetic field (h ext). For a given temperature, the mean value of the energy ⟨U⟩ is calculated by ⟨U⟩ = 1 (NC − N0) NC ∑ i>N0 Ui, (4) where NC represents the total number of Monte Carlo cycles and N0 is the number of Monte Carlo cycles used for thermalization. The mean square energy ⟨U2⟩ is obtained by a relation similar to Eq. (4). Now, the magnetic part of the heat capacity can be calculated as Cm(T, h ext) = ⟨U2⟩ − ⟨U⟩ 2 kBT2 , (5) where kB is the Boltzmann constant. In this study, the Monte-Carlo simulations were performed using the VAMPIRE simulation soft- ware,49 which produces the magnetic heat capacity as one of the outputs. Following the determination of phonon frequencies through the frozen phonon method, the constant volume phonon heat capacity (CV ) can be calculated using the following equation as implemented in the Phonopy code: 51,52 CV = ∑ qj Cqj = ∑ qj kB( ̵hωqj kBT ) 2 exp (̵hωqj/kBT) [exp (̵hωqj/kBT) − 1]2 , (6) where q is the wave vector, j is the band index, ωqj is the phonon frequency, and h is the reduced Planck’s constant. We used the calcu- lated CV as an approximation for the constant-pressure heat capacity Cp since in the low-temperature regime of solids, CV ≈ Cp.53 Finally, Ce is given by Ce = π2k2 BD(EF) 3 T = γeT, (7) where π2k 2 BD(EF ) 3 represents the electronic heat-capacity coefficient and D(EF) represents the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy EF. Next, ΔTad was estimated using the calculated CT by employing the following equation: ΔTad = μ0∫ H f Hi T CT ( ∂M ∂T ) HdH. (8) We note here that the coupling between spins and lattice vibra- tions can play a significant role in many exceptional magnetocaloric materials, as shown in our previous work where we conducted explicit spin-lattice dynamics (SLD) simulation to accurately com- pute ΔSM in gadolinium.12 However, the high computational cost of SLD prohibits its use in a high-throughput search. In addition, since we focus on a lower temperature range in this work (< 100 K), sup- pressed lattice vibrations should, in principle, reduce the significance of spin-lattice coupling in most magnetocaloric materials. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS A. Database generation and machine learning model We successfully created a database with high accuracy using the LLM API, demonstrating the efficacy of our pipeline. The poten- tial for hallucination (i.e., incorrect ΔSM or TC values) was avoided through the self-examination process. The final database, contain- ing 752 entries, is machine learning-friendly due to the clarity of material names and the ease of finding additional physical properties by cross-referencing the Materials Project database. However, there are still key issues that limit the precision of the database. First, the text format cannot always accurately identify mathematical or phys- ical symbols, leading to the loss of key information (e.g., numerical value or unit). Second, the LLM API sometimes fails to make cor- rect judgments when the text mentions both Curie temperature and Néel temperature. As a result, some of the Néel temperature records within the database have been incorrectly identified as Curie tem- peratures, which is an intrinsic issue with the LLM. Compared to this, the LLM has high accuracy for ΔSM values for each record. We used a human-corrected version of the database for higher accuracy training of the machine learning model. One strength of our model is that we added additional phys- ical information to our input vectors obtained from the Materials Project database during the training process. Physical information is added by containing total magnetization, volume, and density infor- mation from the Materials Project and the spatial partition of the element distribution. The results showed robust performance-based MSE and MAE. We also did a recall evaluation of the model. In industrial applications, recall evaluation is frequently used where the emphasis is on identifying and capturing as many true positive cases as possible, even at the expense of some false positives. By examin- ing the recalls at various K values, it becomes evident that our model can consistently rank materials based on their ΔSM values. In addi- tion, our model stands out for its remarkable efficiency. Unlike many other studies that rely on complex model architectures or require extensive datasets with hundreds of features, this model achieves impressive results with a surprisingly simple structure. It utilizes a neural network with only three layers and 16 neurons and leverages a basic input vector of just four essential features with a total length of 11. This combination of simplicity and effectiveness makes this model a compelling choice for faster iteration and prediction. The strong self-validation of the model indicates that it successfully cap- tures most of the physical features. However, it is important to note that the model’s generalization ability is compromised due to the limited size of the training and testing datasets before augmentation. This limitation may introduce certain biases when searching for new MCE materials. The frequency distribution of ΔSM and TC values of the training dataset is shown in supplementary material Fig. S1. It is noteworthy that 70.0% of materials in the training dataset exhibit a TC below 100 K. This prevalent feature is crucial for the model’s capacity to identify additional candidates with a TC within the desired range (10–100 K). The frequency distribution of rare-earth elements in our training dataset in supplementary material Fig. 1(c) shows that 81.6% of the reported MCE candidates in the dataset contain heavy rare-earth elements. This prior knowledge and observation moti- vated us to generate a screening list from the Materials Project by requiring the presence of heavy rare-earth elements: Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Eu. Using this criterion, we found 1124 stable materials containing 2–8 atoms in the unit cell. We separated them into three lists based on the number of elements: 370 candidates contain two elements, 711 candidates contain three elements, and 43 candidates contain at least four elements. The machine learning model pro- vides one ranked list for each group. We picked the top 50 materials AIP Advances 14, 085125 (2024); doi: 10.1063/5.0206855 14, 085125-7 © Author(s) 2024 26 May 2025 11:30:13 AIP Advances ARTICLE pubs.aip.org/aip/adv predicted by the machine learning model for further studies using DFT and ASD. B. DFT and ASD calculations The primary objective of machine learning is material predic- tion; therefore, it is necessary to assess the quality of the predictive model. Hence, we validated the MCE response of the predicted com- pounds through DFT and ASD simulations. Initially, the predicted structures were optimized within the spin-polarized PBE-DFT level of theory. The total energies of magnetic structures with vari- ous combinations of in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic orderings were compared to determine the magnetic ground state. Materials exhibiting ferromagnetic ground states were further analyzed for their MCE properties as they typically demonstrate direct MCE with ΔSM < 0 and ΔTad > 0,54,55 indicating that the sample heats up when an external magnetic field is applied adiabatically. Materials with a direct MCE effect typically exhibit higher magnitudes of magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes than the inverse MCE compounds.56 After running a magnetic ground state simulation based on DFT of the top 50 candidates predicted by our machine learn- ing model, we identified 11 ferromagnetic compounds with their TC in the range 10–100 K that have not been studied before for their MCE properties. We then conducted detailed DFT and ASD simulation of their MCE properties. The simulated temperature and field-dependent magnetization and the ΔSM values of a few representative compounds are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The crys- tal structure symmetry, TC, ΔSM, and ΔTad values evaluated using DFT and ASD for the machine learning-predicted compounds are provided in Table III. The estimated TC values closely match the reported measured values, considering that our simulations do not account for other effects, such as anisotropy energy and crystal effective field effects. Our computational predictions reveal a diverse array of mag- netocaloric materials characterized by their TC, ranging from the cryogenic temperatures of liquid helium (4.2 K) to near the boil- ing point of liquid nitrogen (77 K) (Table III). These materials can be systematically classified into three distinct subgroups: lower (10–30 K), medium (30–50 K), and higher (50–90 K) TC materi- als. Notably, the materials in the lower TC subgroup demonstrate exceptional potential for applications such as hydrogen liquefaction (typically around 20 K) and low-temperature magnetic cooling. A notable candidate among these lower TC materials is EuB6, which exhibits a theoretically predicted ΔSM of approximately −48 J kg −1 K−1, surpassing, to the best of our current knowledge, all other known materials in terms of mass-based performance within this temperature range.13 However, when considering the isothermal entropy change per volume, the ΔSM of EuB6 reduces to approxi- mately −0.24 J cm−3 K−1, a value comparatively lower than that of HoB2, which exhibits a ΔSM of approximately −0.36 J cm −3 K−1.13 This disparity arises primarily due to the lower density of EuB6 (5.01 g cm−3) than HoB2 (8.68 g cm−3). In addition, the estimated ΔTad for EuB6 is ∼8.1 K, a figure comparable to other materials with similar transition temperatures.13 In the lower TC subgroup, HoPt FIG. 5.

In the medium-TC range, EuLiH3 exhibits a notable ΔSM value of −28 J kg −1 K−1 (−0.15 J cm −3 K−1) and a ΔTad of 6.7 K at ∼40 K. These values are comparable to the values observed for TbN at 44 K (ΔSM ≈ −21 J kg−1 K−1 ≈ −0.20 J cm−3 K−1 and ΔTad ≈ 8 K).64,65 Moving to the higher-TC range, DyZrSb displays the largest ΔSM at 52 K, while GdMg exhibits the smallest at 90 K (refer to Table III). In addition, it is noteworthy that the predicted materials include a series with the general formula RZrSb (where R = Gd, Tb, Dy, FIG. 6. Comparison of newly discovered MCE materials to the known MCE materials.

Among these, HoZrSb stands out with the highest estimated ΔSM, attributed to the relatively larger effective moment associated with Ho than the other elements in the series. The predicted compounds are compared with other materials exhibiting significant magne- tocaloric responses in the temperature range of 10–90 K for a field change of 5 T, as illustrated in Fig. 6. IV. CONCLUSION In this work, we exploited LLM’s remarkable abilities to sum- marize texts and create an auto-generated MCE materials database from public literature abstracts. Following curation and validation, we trained a neural network with high-quality data to search for good MCE materials. This model efficiently identified unexplored binary and ternary magnetic compounds in the Materials Project database, uncovering promising multiple materials across a wide range of temperatures. We then validated the top candidates using DFT simulations and ASD, discovering new MCE materials for the 10–100 K temperature range. The accuracy of the machine learning model can potentially be further enhanced by integrating the ASD results back into the database and retraining with the enlarged train- ing set. This approach showcases the power of LLMs in mining the literature for data-driven material discovery.
