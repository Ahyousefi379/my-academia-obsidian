Introduction In 2020, global cancer statistics reported that cancer diseases led to ≈10 million deaths worldwide.[1] For quite some time, chemotherapy, which is a method of killing tumor cells and/or inhibiting the growth and proliferation of tumor cells by ad- ministrating cytotoxic chemical drugs, was the only therapeutic approach avail- able to clinicians.[2] The major caveat of chemotherapy is the inability to distin- guish between cancer cells and normal cells, thereby resulting in unwanted side eﬀects in patients.[3] For example, doxoru- bicin (DOX), one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs, usually causes a high incidence of dangerous side eﬀects in patients, including cardiotoxicity, hepato- toxicity, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity.[4] These unwanted side eﬀects often result in poor patient compliance and poor clinical outcomes. [4] Therefore, the development of eﬀective strategies to reduce the toxic adverse eﬀects of important ﬁrst-line can- cer therapeutics such as DOX is urgently needed. In recent years, some new treatment strategies have been im- plemented into clinical practice, such as immunotherapy, pho- todynamic and targeted therapy. [2] Nano-delivery systems have received much attention due to their abilities in terms of im- proving drug stability and solubility, prolonging cycle time, and preventing enzymatic hydrolysis, etc.[5,6] Currently, a variety of nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide, liposome, SiO2, carbon quantum dots, and gold nanoparticles have been developed as chemotherapeutic drug carriers to enhance drug eﬃcacy and reduce side eﬀects.[7–11] Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous materials with unprecedented chemical and structural tunability and they have been considered a type of ideal candidates for drug nanocarriers.[12,13] Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is a subclass of MOF consisting of zinc (Zn) ions and 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) linkers.[14] Previous studies found that ZIF-8 has a faster degradation rate at low pH, which allowed it very amenable as a pH-responsive drug carrier.[15–18] For example, Zheng et al., achieved controlled release of DOX by encapsulating DOX in ZIF-8; Such that the tumor cell inhibition Adv. Healthcare Mater. 2024, 2303839 © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH2303839 (1 of 17) www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de of DOX-loaded ZIF-8 was signiﬁcantly greater than that of free DOX. [19] It is well known that increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)pro- duction occurs as a result of abnormal energy metabolism within the tumor microenvironment (TME). [20] Albeit, the high concen- trations of H2O2 in tumor cells are a double-edged sword, pos- ing both challenges and opportunities for cancer therapy.[21–23] In the past few decades, researchers have been working to de- velop responsive therapy strategies for TME to synergistically en- hance anti-tumor treatments.[24] Chemodynamic therapy (CDT), an emerging cancer treatment strategy, was ﬁrst proposed in 2016, and its core mainly lies in the conversion of H2O2 into hy- droxyl radical (•OH) via the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. [25,26] •OH as a highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) can in- duce apoptosis and necrosis, thereby selectively killing the can- cer cells. [27] Ferroptosis, a new form of iron-dependent pro- gramed cell death, could be triggered by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and ROS. Ferroptosis has been consid- ered as a potential target for cancer therapy.[28,29] Recent studies showed that the non-enzymatic, iron-dependent Fenton chain re- action is likely essential for ferroptosis.[30] Indeed, it has been reported that Fe3O4-incorporated nanoparticles (i.e., cisplatin- loaded Fe3O4/Gd2O3 hybrid nanoparticles with conjugation of lactoferrin and RGD dimer) treatment exhibited potent anti- tumor eﬀects in vitro and in vivo by promoting Fenton reaction- mediated ferroptosis.[31] Additionally, several studies found that small particle size Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibited higher catalytic rates of the Fenton reaction. [31] Unfortunately, the application of small particle size Fe3O4 is hampered by inadequate tumor re- tention, severe aggregation, and poor biosafety. [32,33] Moreover, the low acidity of tumor sites also hampers the eﬃciency of the Fenton reaction. [34,35] Therefore, there exists a major gap in our ability to improve the biosafety and Fenton reactivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles for use in targeted cancer therapy. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is an anionic cellulose ether with good water solubility, stability, biodegradability, and safety. [36] CMC has been approved by the Food and Drug Admin- istration (FDA) for various nutritional, biomedical, and pharma- ceutical applications. [37] Studies have reported that CMC acts as a stabilizer that can prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles.[38] ZIF-8 nanoparticles could be captured by lysosomes via endo- cytosis, then promoting drug release.[39,40] Here, we demon- strated the synergistic anti-tumor eﬃcacy of a novel hybrid chemo/ferroptosis nanoparticle that integrates ultra-small Fe3O4 and ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Our in vitro and in vivo eﬃcacy stud- ies showed that DOX-ZIF-8@Fe3O4/CMC (DZFC) nanoparticles treatment could signiﬁcantly enhance the chemotherapy eﬀect of DOX via triggering ferroptosis through the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signaling pathway. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Characterization of Nanoparticles To obtain the magnetic nanoparticles with good stability, we use CMC to modify Fe3O4, which is followed by the general procedure provided by Chalermchai et al.[36] Then, ultra-small Fe3O4/CMC (FC) was loaded onto ZIF-8 via the simple one- pot method at room temperature, according to the previous study.[41] The synthesis process of DZFC is illustrated in Figure 1a. First, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging re- vealed that synthesized Fe3O4 via the co-precipitation method dis- played marked agglomeration (Figure S1a, Supporting Informa- tion), whereas modiﬁed Fe3O4 using CMC exhibited good dis- persion (Figure 1b). The high stability of Fe3O4/CMC nanopar- ticles may be associated with the surface functional groups of CMC that could inﬂuence the nucleation and growth processes of the nanoparticles.[37] The structure of FC was characterized using X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) (Figure 1d), which is consistent with Fe3O4 (JCPDS No. 88–0315). In addition, high resolution- TEM image showed that the lattice fringe spacing of FC nanopar- ticles is 0.203 nm, which is in line with the lattice spacing of Fe3O4 (3 1 1) crystal faces (Figure S1b, Supporting Informa- tion). These results implied that FC nanoparticles with an inverse spinel structure were successfully synthesized. The TEM images of ZIF-8, ZIF-8@Fe3O4/CMC (ZFC), and DZFC clearly showed the regular crystal morphology and mono-dispersed nanoparti- cles (Figure 1b). The results of energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental imaging showed that iron element was dis- tributed on the surface of ZIF-8 in ZFC (Figure S2a, Support- ing Information) and DZFC (Figure 1c). Scanning electron mi- croscope (SEM) results showed that ZIF-8 possesses a typical rhombic dodecahedral structure (Figure S2b, Supporting Infor- mation). The SEM image of DZFC showed that FC is wrapped around the surface on ZIF-8 (Figure S2c, Supporting Informa- tion), which is consistent with the TEM images (Figure S2d,Sup- porting Information). The results of XRD showed that XRD pat- terns of ZIF-8, ZFC and DZFC are consistent with the simulated patterns of ZIF-8 (Figure 1e), indicating that ZFC and DZFC nanoparticles both have the same sodalite topography with ZIF- 8. Furthermore, the dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to measure the size of nanoparticles (Figure 1f). The hydrodynamic diameters of FC, ZIF-8, ZFC, and DZFC were 38.1, 159.7, 180.1, and 244.2 nm, respectively. The increase in particle sizes of ZFC and DZFC is mainly attributed to the addition of FC and DOX, respectively. The Zeta potential of pure Fe3O4 was 4.1 mV and it was decreased to −35.4 mV in CMC-modiﬁed Fe3O4 (Figure 1g). The latter may account for the signiﬁcant improvement of FC dis- persion, which is consistent with the TEM results. Following the modiﬁcation of FC, the Zeta potential of ZIF-8 decreased from 25.0 to 15.9 mV and the zeta potential of DZFC was reduced to −13.0 mV (Figure 1g), which is attributed to the DOX and FC loaded together on ZIF-8. Finally, the DOX loading content of DZFC measured by UV–Vis was 28.3% and the encapsulation eﬃciency was 81.8%. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, Raman spectra, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were further employed to verify the com- position of the nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 1h, the 500–1350 cm−1 and 1350–1500 cm −1 regions of the spectrum were assigned to the plane bending and stretching of imidazole, respectively; The stretching vibration absorption at 421 cm−1 and 2929 cm−1 are from the Zn-N coordination bond and the C-H bond in the imidazole, respectively; these characterizations are consistent with Zhang et al. study. [42] The peak at 1624 cm−1 is caused by the stretching vibration of the C = C bond in the Adv.

The ZIF-8/DOX synthesized by Wu et al., also obtained similar FTIR results. [43] From the FTIR spectra of FC, the characteristic peak at 585 cm −1 ascribed to the Fe-O bond, [44] while similar absorption peaks also appeared in both ZFC and DZFC, indicating the successful modiﬁcationofFC. Figure 1i showed the Raman spectra of ZIF- 8, ZFC, and DZFC, and strong bands were observed at 273 cm−1, 686 cm−1, 1147 cm−1, and 1459 cm−1 corresponding to Zn-N vibration stretching, imidazole ring puckering, C-N stretching and methyl bending, respectively.[45] In the low wavenumber region, there are two peaks at 286 cm−1 and 420 cm−1,which are in accordance with that of Fe3O4. [46] TGA-curve showed that ZIF-8 remained stable under 500 °C with a weight loss of only 2.6%. ZIF-8, ZFC, and DZFC underwent a rapid weight loss from 535 °C to 620 °C(Figure 1j), which was attributed to the exothermic decomposition of the ligand 2-MIM in this temperature range.[47] In addition, a total weight loss of ≈48.0%, 46.6%, and 31.4% occurred in ZIF-8, ZFC, and DZFC from 535 °C to 900 °C, owing to the conversion of ZIF-8 to Zn oxide. [48] The weight loss of DZFC nanoparticles had a high rate from 110 °C to 210 °C, and turned to be slow from 210 °C to 535 °C. The total weight loss of DZFC from 110 °C to 535 °C is 29.3%, which is attributed to the degradation of DOX and CMC main chains. [49,50] The full XPS showed that the proportion of iron in DZFC nanoparticles was 1.26% (Figure 1k). The high resolution of XPS results showed various peaks at 1021.6 and 1044.4 eV, 398.8 and 399.6 eV, 285.8 and 284.8 eV (Figure S3, Supporting Information), which were the indication of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 (from ZIF-8), C-N and C = N bond (from 2-MIM), C = C and C-O bond (from DOX), respectively. [51–53] Of note, these two peaks at binding energies of 711.69 and 724.49 eV are attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, of which are both the properties of ferric iron (Figure S3, Supporting Information). While these two peaks with binding energies of 709.79 and 722.59 eV are derived from the divalent iron in the nanoparticles (Figure S3d, Supporting Information), they play an important role in triggering the Fenton reaction and ferroptosis.[54] 2.2. pH-Responsive Release of Doxorubicin (DOX) To assess the pH-sensitive drug release of nanoparticles, simul- taneous release experiments under diﬀerent pH conditions were performed. Figure 2a showed the drug release kinetics of DOX from DZFC nanoparticles. When DZFC was dispersed in PBS with pH 7.4, the release rate of DOX is ≈8.5% within 7 days. The release rate of DOX increased to 53.4% and 85.4%, respec- tively, when the values of pH decreased to 6.5 and 5.0, respec- tively. These data indicated that the release of DOX from DZFC is in a pH-responsive manner, which was mainly attributed to the ability of ZIF-8′s pH-responsive degradation.[55] TEM images re- vealed the impact of diﬀerent pH values (i.e., pH = 7.4, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively) on the morphology of DZFC (Figure 2b). DZFC maintained stable morphology in PBS of pH 7.4, which is consis- tent with the low release of DOX. In contrast, marked morpho- logical perturbations in DZFC were detected when it was exposed to pH 6.5, which was further accentuated at the lower pH 5.0. In general, ZIF-8 nanoparticles possess good water stability at the range of pH > 7 and are quickly degraded under meta-acidic conditions, which underlies their utility as targeted anti-tumor drug carriers.[14,16] To investigate whether the chemical state of DOX was altered following nanoparticle release, mass spectrom- etry was employed to detect DOX in the release medium. Figure S4 (Supporting Information) showed the primary and secondary mass spectra of the acidic release media containing DZFC in pos- itive ion mode, which correlates well with the mass spectra of the DOX standard. It is worth noting that a high response was ob- served in the primary mass spectrometry with the Mass/Charge of 83.05, which is the signal peak of 2-MIM. This also strongly evidenced that ZIF-8 disintegrated under acidic conditions. No- tably, anaerobic glycolysis leads to an acidic microenvironment in tumor tissues (pH = 6.5-6.9).[56] Lysosomes are acidic organelles (pH = 4.5-5.5) within cells.[57] In this study, PBS at pH 6.5 and 5.0 was used to simulate the pH environment of TME and lyso- somes, respectively. Consistent with the ﬁndings of Zheng et al., ZIF-8 exhibited faster drug release kinetics in PBS at pH 5 than both at pH 6.5 and 7.4.[19] The pH-responsive degradation of ZIF- 8 may be related to the protonation of the 2-MIM linkers.[58] This unique pH-sensitive property seems to be well exploited in TME. The degradation process of ZIF-8 is strictly controlled by the acid- ity of the release medium. Drug-loaded ZIF-8 generally needs to be at pH 5.5 or below to ensure a high release rate. [15–17] There- fore, accelerated pH-responsive drug release via lysosomes is an eﬀective strategy. 2.3. The Generation of Hydroxyl Radical (•OH) Typically, highly reactive •OH is recognized to induce dam- age to DNA, organelles, and biomolecules. [59] Herein, we em- ployed 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as an •OH indica- tor, wherein the reaction with •OH to form oxidized TMB that ex- hibits a UV absorption peak at 652 nm. In the absence of nanopar- ticles, almost no absorbance was observed at 652 nm (Figure 2c); However, in the presence of nanoparticles, prominent absorption peaks appeared at 652 nm. The FC, ZFC, and DZFC nanoparti- cles all exhibited vigorous colorimetric reactions, indicating that the nanoparticles reacted with H2O2 to generate •OH. In con- trast, ZIF-8 cannot react with H2O2 to generate •OH (Figure 2d). Presumably, the active sites of Fe3O4 occupied by ZIF-8 and DOX may limit the reaction eﬃciency, which may explain why the ab- sorbance of ZFC and DZFC was slightly lower than that of FC. Furthermore, the •OH production ability of the DZFC nanopar- ticles under diﬀerent concentrations of H2O2 was examined. As shown in Figure 2e, the production of •OH is H2O2-dependent, and exposure to high concentrations of H2O2 induced increased levels of •OH with faster reaction kinetics. Studies have shown that the concentration of H2O2 in cancer cells is higher than that in healthy cells, this greatly enhances the eﬃciency of the Fenton reaction in cancer cells and improves the targeting of CDT.[60,61] We then proceeded to introduce 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) as a •OH scavenger. To verify whether the nanoparti- cles possess the desired CDT eﬀect, the radical species and in- tensity in DMPO-radical adducts were identiﬁed by electron spin resonance (ESR). The results showed that the appearance of the characteristic signal spectrum of 1:2:2:1 proved the generation of Adv.

In contrast, there was no characteristic signal spectrum of •OH appeared with ZIF-8 per se. Previous studies conﬁrmed that Fe3O4 could catalyze the Fenton reaction and promote cisplatin-induced fer- roptotic cell death in cancer cells.[62] Taken together, these data suggested that the production of •OH driven by DZFC nanoparti- cles was mainly attributed to the catalytic activity of Fe3O4.Previ- ous studies have demonstrated that the Fe 2+-mediated Fenton re- action is strongly driven under acidic conditions (pH values in the range of 2–4) and is ineﬃcient under physiological neural con- ditions and weakly acidic TME (i.e., pH = 6.5-6.9).[56] Our ﬁnd- ings suggest that that DZFC nanoparticles could produce more •OH at pH 5 and it was also time- and pH-dependent manner (Figure 2h,i). Thus, DZFC nanoparticles are also expected to en- hance CDT eﬃciency by virtue of the acidic environment of lyso- somes (pH = 4.5-5.5). 2.4. Cytotoxicity and Cellular Uptake of DOX-ZIF-8@Fe3O4/CMC (DZFC) Nanoparticles The CCK-8 method was used to assess the cell viability of MCF-7 cells after nanoparticle treatment. As shown in Figure 3a,MCF-7 cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner in response to treatment with DOX, ZIF-8, ZFC, and DZFC at increasing doses (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μgmL−1) for 12 h. The DZFC was the most cytotoxic, with 32.8% of the cells alive in the free DOX group, while only 13.2% in the DZFC-treated group at a concentration of 50 μgmL−1, reﬂecting the synergistic anti-tumor activity of the nanoparticles complex. According to the XRD re- sults, the atomic percentage of Zn in DZFC is 4.35% and the weight percentage of Zn is 18.01%. Therefore, in this study, DZFC treatment at the dose of 50 μgmL−1 is equal to 0.138 mM Zn2+.Asshown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), ZnCl2 Adv.

Therefore, in the present study, the Zn 2+ released from DZFC did not contribute to its cytotoxic eﬀects in MCF-7 cells. To investigate whether DOX and ZFC in DZFC has a synergistic eﬀect, a CompuSyn program based on the Chou-Talaly algorithm was used. [63] This program oﬀers var- ious parameters such as the dose-eﬀect curve, the median-eﬀect plot, the combination index (CI) plot and the normalized isobolo- gram. The ratio of DOX to ZFC in this study was ﬁxed at 28:72 based on the loading content. The results showed that the CI of DOX and ZFC in DZFC was lower than 1.0, and the CI was 0.69 at a DZFC concentration of 50 μgmL−1, which suggests a syn- ergistic eﬀect (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The cellular uptake of DZFC was monitored by measuring total intracellu- lar levels of Zn and Fe using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The levels of intracellular Zn and Fe in- creased in a time-dependent manner and reached 7.8 ng μg−1 protein and 45.2 ng μg −1 proteinat6h(both P < 0.001), re- spectively (Figure 3b,c). In addition, confocal laser scanning mi- croscopy (CLSM) was also used to assess the uptake of DZFC by MCF-7 cells. Free DOX accumulated in the nucleus, and the ﬂuorescence signal increased with longer incubation times, al- beit, the nucleus morphology always remained intact (Figure 3d). The latter indicates that free DOX could not induce apoptosis rapidly, which is consistent with previous studies.[19] Red ﬂuores- cence appeared in cells after treatment with DZFC and increased with prolonged exposure time, indicating that the nanoparticles were successfully internalized (Figure 3d). Notably, the red ﬂuo- rescence was distributed in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus compared to free DOX, suggesting that the nanoparticles per- turbed the intracellular delivery route of DOX. In addition, we observed that DZFC treatment at 50 μgmL−1 for 12 h could cause nucleus deformation, condensation, and fragmentation and the level of DNA fragmentation signiﬁcantly increased to 1.44-, 1.97- , and 3.04- fold at 4, 6, and 12 h after DZFC treatment at the dose of 50 μgmL−1 (the corresponding dose of DOX is 14 μg mL −1); Correspondingly, there was no marked DNA damage in the free DOX (at 14 μgmL −1) treated- MCF-7 cells (Figure 3d,e). Figure 3f showed the co-localization of DZFC within the lysoso- mal compartment, which was evident from the signiﬁcant yellow ﬂuorescence in DZFC-treated MCF-7 cells. Fluorescence quan- tiﬁcation also showed a gradual increase in cellular uptake of DZFC with increasing exposure time of DZFC (Figure 3g). These results demonstrated that DZFC nanoparticles are successfully captured by lysosomes, and the acidic environment of the lyso- some favorably promotes DOX release. Consistently, Cui et al. constructed a microRNA delivery system based on ZIF-8 and the eﬀective release of microRNA via lysosomal encapsulation was detected.[64] Taken together, our data indicated that DZFC nanoparticles provided an eﬀective anti-tumor drug delivery in a lysosome-triggered pH-responsive manner. It is well documented that the endocytic pathway can inﬂuence the fate of nanoparticles within the cells. [65] To explore the inter- nalization mode of DZFC further, three classic endocytosis in- hibitors, i.e., amiloride (the macropinocytosis inhibitor), methyl- beta cyclodextrin (M-𝛽-CD, the caveolae-mediated endocytosis in- hibitor), and chlorpromazine (the clathrin-mediated endocyto- sis inhibitor), were employed. Amiloride inhibits macropinocyto- sis by blocking Na +/H+ exchange,[66] M-𝛽-CD inhibits caveolae- mediated endocytosis by removing cholesterol from the plasma membrane,[67] and chlorpromazine inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis by inhibiting the AP-2 subunit of clathrin. [68] No- tably, These three inhibitors at the corresponding tested doses were non-cytotoxic against MCF-7 cells (shown in Figure S7, Supporting Information), but only chlorpromazine pretreat- ment signiﬁcantly reduced the intracellular ﬂuorescence inten- sity of DOX, suggesting that the clathrin-mediated endocyto- sis pathway plays a critical role for the intracellular uptake of DZFC nanoparticles (Figure 3g). Consistent results were also obtained using the CLSM method (Figure S8, Supporting Information). 2.5. Molecular Mechanisms of DZFC Nanoparticles-Induced Cell Death in MCF-7 Cells – Transcriptomics and Chemical Biology Studies Transcriptomic analysis was performed to investigate the un- derlying mechanisms of MCF-7 tumor cell death induced by DZFC nanoparticle exposure. The original transcriptomic data has been uploaded to the NCBI (login number: PRJNA1067837). Diﬀerentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by com- paring the DZFC-treated group with the control group based on RNA sequencing results. As shown in Figure 4a, a total of 2122 DEGs were identiﬁed, including 641 up-regulated genes and 1481 down-regulated genes (fold change [FC] | ≥ 2.0, P < 0.05). To determine the biological function of these DEGs and the signaling pathways involved, pathway analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was per- formed. As shown in Figure 4b, KEGG analysis revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), apoptosis, tumor necrosis factor, ferroptosis, and p53 signaling pathways were signiﬁcantly perturbed. Gene Ontology (GO)-term analysis re- vealed that the “response to metal ion” and ‘response to oxy- gen levels responses were perturbed (Figure 4c). The MAPK, p53, and autophagy pathways are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis. [69,70] Consistently, these pathways were also enriched in the results of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis (Figure 4d–f). Hydrophenyl ﬂuorescein (HPF) was employed to monitor the production of intracellular •OH. As shown in Figure 5a,b,com- pared to treatment with the DOX or ZIF-8 nanoparticles per se, ZFC and DZFC nanoparticles treatment signiﬁcantly increased the levels of •OH in MCF-7 cells. This indicated that ZFC and DZFC treatment signiﬁcantly elevated the levels of intracellular •OH in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, both ZFC and DZFC nanopar- ticles treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly decreased levels of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) (Figure 5c). Interest- ingly, ZIF-8 treatment also decreased intracellular GSH levels. This may be due to glutathione reductase inactivation by ZIF-8 through the accumulation of intracellular Zn 2+. [71] Notably, we found that Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a classic ferroptosis inhibitor,[72] signiﬁcantly reversed DZFC nanoparticles-induced cell death (the cell viability from 14.1% increased to 43.3%) (Figure 5d). LPO is an important indicator of ferroptosis. C11-BODIPY was employed to detect intracellular LPO after various treatments.[73] Adv.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advhealthmat.de As shown in Figure 5e,f, the intracellular ﬂuorescence intensi- ties of MCF-7 cells treated with ZFC and DZFC nanoparticles were both signiﬁcantly elevated, whereas the addition of ferropto- sis inhibitor Fer-1 signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of intracellular LPO. Collectively, these data indicated that DZFC nanoparticles- induced cell death in MCF-7 cells is dependent on ferroptosis. Ab- normalities in mitochondrial morphology and function are im- portant characteristics of ferroptosis. [74] Rhodamine 123 stain- ing showed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in MCF- 7 cells treated with DZFC (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is an important antioxidant en- zyme in cells and it could inhibit ferroptosis by scavenging LPO of membranes.[75] Compared to the DOX and ZIF-8 alone treat- ment groups, ZFC and DZFC treatments both signiﬁcantly de- creased the levels of GPX4 protein (Figure 5 g,h). It may be de- pendent on the presence of Fe3O4, which is a key mediator of the Fenton reaction. [76] Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) is a light chain subunit of the Xc-system, which could promote GSH synthe- sis and protect cells from oxidative stress by mediating cys- tine uptake. [77] Ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) is an important constituent subunit of ferritin, which is involved in the stor- age of cytosolic iron.[78] Previous studies found that ferritin is a key ferroptosis regulator, and its level directly aﬀects the sen- sitivity of cells to ferroptosis.[79] Previous studies have demon- strated that autophagy can promote ferroptosis by degradation of ferritin, and SLC7A11 proteins.[80,81] In the present study, we showed that DZFC nanoparticles treatment signiﬁcantly down- regulated the expression of p62 protein, and upregulated the expression of LC3-II. Similarly, an upregulation of autophagy ﬂux was detected in DZFC nanoparticles-treated MCF-7 cells (Figure 5i–k). DZFC nanoparticles treatment also signiﬁcantly downregulated the expression of GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1 proteins in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 5I,j). Taken together, these data indicated that DZFC nanoparticles treatment-induced ferroptosis is dependent on the regulation of SLC7A11 and GPX4. In addition, we showed that the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and chloroquine (CQ), could signiﬁcantly inhibit DZFC nanoparticles-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5l), indicating autophagy activation partly contributed to DZFC nanoparticles-induced ferroptosis. DZFC nanoparticles treatment signiﬁcantly upregulated the expression of p-JNK in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5m). Pretreatment of JNK in- hibitor (i.e., SP600125), but not p38 inhibitor (i.e., SB203580), signiﬁcantly protected the cells against DZFC nanoparticles- induced cell death (Figure 5n). Notably, a previous study showed that JNK-mediated ferroptosis is GPX4-dependent, [82] and the in- hibition of the JNK pathway could attenuate intracellular ROS levels, attenuating cellular ferroptosis.[83] These data indicated that DZFC nanoparticles-induced ferroptosis is partly attributed to the activation of the JNK pathway. 2.6. In Vivo Anti-Tumor We assessed the anti-tumor eﬃciency of DZFC further using a xenograft mouse model. At 14th day after xenograft, the tu- mor volumes were increased in the range of 200–250 mm 3,and the tumor-bearing mice were administrated intravenously with saline, ZIF-8, DOX, ZFC, and DZFC (once per three days, the doses of DOX in the DOX and DZFC treatment groups are 2.4 mg kg −1) for additional 21 days (Figure 6a). The tumor growth status of tumor-bearing mice before sacriﬁce was recorded (Figure 6b). The tumor volumes in saline-treated and ZIF-8-treated groups increased rapidly and signiﬁcantly bigger than that in the DOX, ZFC, and DZFC group (Figure 6c,d). The tumor growth inhibi- tion (TGI) was further calculated. In the DOX and ZFC-treated groups, the TGI is 43.5% and 34.2%, respectively, while it in- creased to 70.5% in the DZFC-treated group (Figure 6e). These results indicated that DZFC had the enhanced anti-tumor treat- ment. Consistently, our terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining results showed a marked in- crease in the DZFC group, compared to that of other treatment groups (i.e., DOX, ZIF-8, and ZFC groups) (Figure S10a,Sup- porting Information). Consistently, H&E staining results showed DZFC therapy induced obvious tissue atrophy, damage, and cell death (Figure S10b, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, the ex- pression of Ki67 protein, a biomarker of cell proliferation, was signiﬁcantly downregulated in the DZFC treatment group, com- pared to that of other treatment groups (i.e., DOX, ZIF-8, and ZFC groups) (Figure 6f). These data further conﬁrmed the bet- ter anti-tumor eﬀect of DZFC nanoparticles. To conﬁrm the role of ferroptosis in DZFC-treated tumor tissues, the expressions of GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH1 proteins were measured. As shown in Figure 6g–i, the expression of GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11 pro- teins in tumor tissues was signiﬁcantly decreased in both ZFC- and DZFC-treated groups, compared to the DOX or ZIF-8 alone treatment groups. In addition, autophagy levels in tumor tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry method. Compared with the saline control group, the expression of LC3 protein was increased and p62 expression levels were decreased in the ZIF- 8, ZFC and DZFC treatment groups and no marked changes in the DOX alone treatment group (Figure S11, Supporting Infor- mation). These data are consistent with the above in vitro data (Figure 5). Therefore, our in vivo anti-tumor investigations fur- ther revealed that DZFC nanoparticles signiﬁcantly enhance the chemotherapy eﬀect of DOX by triggering ferroptosis and achiev- ing synergistic anti-tumor eﬃcacy. To investigate whether DZFC could improve the biodistribu- tion of DOX in tumor-bearing mice, liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry was used to measure the concentrations of DOX in tissues at predetermined times (1, 2, and 6 h) after DOX or DZFC treatments (Figure S12a,b, Supporting Information). The results showed that free DOX was widely distributed in the DZFC at various concentrations (12.5, 25 and 50 μgmL−1, respectively) for 12 h and the corresponding quantitative analysis (n = 3). j) Representative Western blot images of LC3II, p62, GPX4, FTH1, and SLC7A11 proteins in MCF-7 cells treated with 50 μgmL−1 DZFC for diﬀerent time (3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively) and the corresponding quantitative analysis (n = 3). k) Representative images of punctate GFP-LC3 (white arrows) distribution after diﬀerent nanoparticles treatments.

In contrast, the accumula- tion of DOX at the tumor site in the DZFC treatment group was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the free DOX treatment group. It was attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) eﬀect of DZFC nanoparticles. Notably, the concentration of DOX in the lungs was elevated after DZFC treatment, compared to the DOX treatment, which was attributed to the non-speciﬁc uptake of nanoparticles by the lungs. [84] In addition, the contents of Zn and Fe in major organs were assessed. At 21st day after adminis- tration to tumor-bearing mice, the levels of Zn and Fe showed a signiﬁcant increase in the DZFC treatment group, compared to the DOX group; While the changes in other organs were negligi- ble (Figures S12c,d, Supporting Information). This indicates that DZFC nanoparticles are highly enriched at the tumor site. 2.7. Assessment of Safety In Vivo The safety of nanomaterials is a major impediment in the process of their applications in clinical practices.[85] For clinical transla- tion, Zn, an essential trace element in the human body, is con- sidered a highly biocompatible metal ion. Short-term in vivo toxi- city experiments also conﬁrmed a promising safety proﬁle.[86] In addition, ZIF-8 can eﬀectively enhance tumor retention and ex- hibit good targeting and safety based on its EPR eﬀect. [35] The biosafety of DZFC nanoparticles was further evaluated in mice. First, the negligible changes in body weight of mice in various treatments were observed during the period of treatment (Figure 7a). The functions of the heart, liver, and kidney were evalu- ated. The corresponding biochemical indicators, including cre- atinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phos- phatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transami- nase (AST), creatinine (CREA) and urea (UR), were analyzed. As showninFigure 7b–h, the levels of ALP, ALT, and AST (three biomarkers of liver function) were signiﬁcantly elevated in DOX alone-treated mice, indicating the induction of hepatotoxicity. In contrast, no signiﬁcant changes in the levels of CK, LDH, ALP, ALT, AST, CREA, and UR were detected in both the ZFC and DZFC treatment groups. These data indicated no marked toxic eﬀects at the current dose of DZFC nanoparticles. Corre- spondingly, the results of H&E staining showed that the marked liver injury only presented in the DOX treatment group and no marked injuries in livers, kidneys, and hearts of mice treated with ZFC or DZFC nanoparticles (Figure 7i). These results indicated that DZFC nanoparticles had an excellent biocompatibility. 3. Conclusion In summary, we successfully designed an in situ catalytic hy- droxyl radical generation strategy in tumors with core-shell ZIF- 8@Fe3O4 as a therapeutic platform to enhance DOX and Fen- ton reaction-mediated chemo/ferroptosis synergistic anti-breast tumor treatment. The modiﬁcation of CMC could eﬀectively im- prove the dispersibility of Fe3O4 and the stability of ZIF-8@Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The obtained DZFC nanoparticles exhibited po- tent anti-tumor eﬀect. Upon the molecular mechanisms’ inves- tigations, our data reveal that the obtained DZFC nanoparti- cles could enter the lysosomes through clathrin-mediated en- docytosis, then promote the production of excessive •OH in MCF-7 cells, ﬁnally in cascade to triggering GPX4-dependent ferroptosis through the activation of the JNK signaling path- way. Furthermore, DZFC nanoparticles exhibited greater safety than DOX per se. Overall, this composite nanoparticle enhances chemo/ferroptosis synergistic therapy through lysosomal target- ing, and remarkably suppresses the tumor growth with mini- mized systemic toxicity, opening new horizons for the next gen- eration of theragnostic nanomedicines. 4. Experimental Section Chemicals and Materials: Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2•6H2O, 99%), ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3•6H2O, 99%), and ferrous chlo- ride tetrahydrate (FeCl2•4H2O, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). DOX hydrochloride (DOX•HCl, 98%), 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM, 99%), amiloride hydrochloride, methyl-beta- cyclodextrin (M-𝛽-CD), chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ, 98%), chloro- quine (CQ, 98%), and ferrostain-1 (Fer-1, 95%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 99%), acridine orange hydrochloride was purchased from MedChemExpress (NJ, USA). CCK- 8 kit, JC-1 probe, and TUNEL apoptosis assay kit were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). LysoTracker Green and BODIPY 581/591 C11, and hydrophenyl ﬂuorescein (HPF) were pur- chased from ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc (MA, USA). Hoechst 33 342, peni- cillin/streptomycin (100 U mL−1), and tyrisin-EDTA (0.25%) were supplied by Solarbio Science Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Dulbecco mod- iﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was purchased from Gibco (CA, USA). All materials and reagents were used without further puriﬁcation. Synthesis of Fe3O4/CMC: Fe3O4/CMC was synthesized based on pre- vious reports with minor modiﬁcations.[38] In brief, 80 mg CMC was added to 80 mL of deionized water, the mixture was heated at 90 °C to facili- tate dissolution. Then 2.703 g FeCl3•6H2O and 0.994 g FeCl2•4H2Owere added to the solution, and heated at 90 °C under nitrogen, then 6 mL of 25 wt.% NH3•H2O was added dropwise and kept under vigorous stirring for 1 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and suspension was obtained; The suspension was then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min. Fe3O4/CMC material was repeatedly washed to neutrality with deionized water. Finally, the Fe3O4/CMC material was dispersed in an aqueous so- lution for the preservation and labeled as FC. Synthesis of DZFC: To prepare DOX-ZIF-8@Fe3O4/CMC nanoparti- cles, synthesis was performed via an “aqueous one pot” method. Brieﬂy, 20 mg FC was added into 5 mL deionized water containing 12.3 mmol 2-MIM, the mixture was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min, then a mix- ture of Zn (NO3)2•6H2O (146 mg mL−1, 0.5 mL) and DOX (10 mg mL−1, 5 mL) were added. After stirring in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, the product was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and washed three times with deionized water and labelled as DZFC, a part of the obtained product was freeze-dried overnight for characterization. The same proce- dure used for the synthesis of DOX-ZIF-8@Fe3O4/CMC was followed for both ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@Fe3O4/CMC (ZFC), except that the Fe3O4/CMC or DOX was replaced by water. To determine the encapsulation eﬃciency (EE) and loading content (LC), the DOX was quantiﬁed through determining the absorbance at 480 nm of the supernatant by UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Particularly, in order to calculate the eﬀective LC, 1 M HCl was used to decompose the DZFC, and the amount of DOX in the supernatant was used to calculate LC according to the following formula: EE (%) = (Mt − Ms) ∕Mt × 100% (1) LC (%) = Mh∕Md × 100% (2) Where Mt is the total mass of DOX input in the synthesis, Ms is the mass of DOX in the supernatant after centrifugation, Mh represents the mass of DOX in the release medium after DZFC was decomposed using HCl. Md means the mass of DZFC. Adv.

Zeta potential and dynamic light scattering re- sults were measured by the Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments, Filderstadt, UK). The thermal stability analysis was performed using a thermogravimetric machine (STA 449 F5, Bavaria, GER). Raman spectra were recorded using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia, Gloucester- shire, UK). XRD patterns were performed on a D8 Advance X-ray diﬀrac- tometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, GER) to investigate the crystal structure of the nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; Nico- let iS10FT-IR spectrometer, WI, USA) was used to assess the surface func- tional groups of the nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Thermo Scientiﬁc Escalab 250Xi, MA, USA) was used for analyzing the chemical state of elements in nanoparticles. The UV–Vis absorption spec- trum was recorded by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Envi- sion, MA, UK). Fluorescence micrographs were collected using confo- cal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X, Hessian, GER). Flow cytometry (BD FACSCelesta, NJ, USA) was performed to record intracellular ﬂuorescence signal intensity. pH-Responsive DOX Release: To evaluate the pH-responsive drug re- lease of the DOX-ZIF-8@Fe3O4/CMC, a typical release system was pre- pared by dispersing 10 mg of DZFC in 20 mL PBS (pH = 7.4, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively, adjusted by hydrochloric acid), then continuously stirred for 7 days in the dark. At each predetermined time, 2 mL of the release medium was taken out and replenished with an equal amount of fresh medium. The content of DOX in the release medium was determined by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer.[87] Mass spectrometry was used to detect the chemical state of DOX in the release medium to monitor the stability of DOX released from the DZFC. TEM was used to observe the stability of DZFC after one week of maintenance in PBS (pH = 7.4) solution and the degradation in PBS (pH = 5.0). Extracellular •OH Detection: 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was used as a chromogenic agent, which could interact with ∙OH and the oxidized TMB showed an increased absorbance of the OD value at 652 nm. This reaction was usually used to measure the levels of ∙OH generation.[88] In brief, an acetate solution containing TMB (1.5 mM) was mixed with dif- ferent nanomaterials (60 μgmL−1)and H2O2 (1.5 mM), respectively. After incubation in the dark for 15 min, the UV–Vis spectrum at 400–800 nm was measured. Afterward, the eﬀect of H2O2 concentration on the production of ∙OH was investigated, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mM H2O2 was added to the so- lution containing TMB (0.5 mM) and DZFC (30 μgmL−1), the absorbance at 652 nm was recorded every 6 min within 180 min. Electron Spin Reso- nance was used to investigate the type of reactive oxygen species and the eﬀect of pH on the rate of •OH generation. Cytotoxicity and Uptake of DZFC Nanoparticles: The MCF-7 cell line, the human breast adenocarcinoma, was used in this work. Cells were cul- tured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic (streptomycin and penicillin), and placed in an incubator at 37 °Cwith 5% CO2. The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (8 × 103 cells per well in 100 μL of medium) and cultured for 24 h, then the original medium was replaced with fresh medium containing diﬀerent concentrations of ZIF-8, ZFC, and DZFC (the concentration of each is 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg mL−1) or free DOX (the amount of free DOX is equivalent to that of DOX in DZFC) and continued to incubate for 12 h, a standard CCK-8 method was used to determine the cell viability. For cellular uptake, after cultured for 48 h, MCF-7 cells were treated with 50 μgmL−1 DZFC or 14 μgmL−1 DOX (equivalent to the amount of DOX in 50 μgmL−1 DZFC) for 1, 2, 4, and 6 h or treated with 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μgmL−1 DZFC for 6 h, the quanti- tative analysis of DZFC was performed using ICP-MS and ﬂow cytometry. Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Basel, Switzer- land) was used to detect DNA fragmentation based on the manufacturer’s protocol. For cell imaging, cells were co-incubated with Hoechst 33 342 for 5 min and then washed three times with PBS, a CLSM was used to observe cellular uptake. Uptake Pathway and Subcellular Localization of DZFC Nanoparticles: The cellular uptake pathway of nanoparticles was assessed by co- incubating DZFC with MCF-7 cells under diﬀerent biochemical inhibitors, including macropinocytosis inhibitor (amiloride), caveolae-mediated en- docytosis inhibitor (methyl-beta cyclodextrin, M-𝛽-CD), clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor (chlorpromazine). In detail, the cells were cultured for 48 h. After being pretreated for 1 h with amiloride (20 μgmL−1), chlor- promazine (10 μgmL−1), and M-𝛽-CD (6 mg mL−1), cells were incubated with 50 μgmL−1 of DZFC for 2 h. MCF-7 cells were collected and cellular uptake was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. For cell imaging, a similar treat- ment was performed, a CLSM was used to observe cellular uptake after the cells were stained with Hoechst 33 342 for 5 min. To explore the sub- cellular localization of DZFC, cells were cultured for 48 h, then removed the original medium and replaced with a fresh medium containing 50 μg mL−1 DZFC. After incubation for 30, 60, and 120 min with DZFC, the cells were co-incubated with Hoechst 33 342 for 5 min and Lyso-Tracker Green for 45 min, and then washed three times with PBS. The subcellular local- ization of DZFC was observed by CLSM. mRNA Sequencing and Analysis: MCF-7 cells were seeded in six-well plates, and after 48 h incubation, MCF-7 cells were treated with DZFC (50 μgmL−1). 4 h of incubation was followed by RNA extraction from the samples with Trizol and genomic DNA removal using DNaseI (Takara). RNA-seq transcriptome library was established and high-throughput se- quencing was further performed. Intracellular •OH Detection: HPF served as an indicator of •OH. MCF- 7 cells were seeded on 6-well plate coverslips and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were treated with ZIF-8 (50 μgmL−1), ZFC (50 μgmL−1), DZFC (50 μgmL−1), or DOX (14 μgmL−1, the amount of free DOX is equivalent to that of DOX in DZFC) for 12 h. After co-incubating cells with HPF (10 μM) for 40 min, a CLSM was used to observe intracellular •OH. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Detection: Rhodamine 123 ﬂuores- cent probe was used to detect mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells were seeded onto 6-well plate coverslips and cultured for 48 h. After co- incubation with ZIF-8 (50 μgmL−1), ZFC (50 μgmL−1), DZFC (50 μg mL−1), or DOX (14 μgmL−1) for 4 h, the cells were stained with rhodamine 123 working solution (5 μgmL−1)at37 °C for 40 min in dark. A CLSM was used to record intracellular ﬂuorescence images. Intracellular Glutathione (GSH) Depletion: The GSH Assay Kit was used to determine the intracellular GSH level. MCF-7 cells were incubated with ZIF-8 (50 μgmL−1), ZFC (50 μgmL−1), DZFC (50 μgmL−1), or DOX (14 μgmL−1) for 12 h, respectively. After that, cells were collected for the determine the intracellular GSH level based on the manufacturer’s proto- col. Lipid Peroxides (LPOs) Detection: MCF-7 cells were seeded onto 6-well plate coverslips. After 48 h incubation, cells were treated with ZIF-8 (50 μg mL−1), ZFC (50 μgmL−1), DZFC (50 μgmL−1), or DOX (14 μgmL−1) for 4 h. Subsequently, cells were washed twice by PBS and stained with BODIPY 581/591 C11 (10 μM) at 37 °C for 30 min in dark. After incubation with Hoechst 33 342 for 5 min, cells were washed with PBS for three times, and then were observed using a CLSM. Autophagy Detection by GFP-LC3: MCF-7 cells were seeded onto 6-well plate coverslips and continued to be cultured for 24 h. Lipofectamine 3000 was utilized to transfect GFP-LC3 plasmid into cells in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. After transfection for 24 h, cells were treated with ZIF-8 (50 μgmL−1), ZFC (50 μgmL−1), DZFC (50 μgmL−1), or DOX (14 μgmL−1) for 4 h. Cells were washed three times by PBS and stained by Hoechst 33 342 for 5 min, a CLSM was used to observe the formation of autophagosome. Western Blot Analysis: After MCF-7 cells were treated with various nanoparticles separately, total cell proteins were extracted by RIPA lysate containing protease inhibitors, and protein concentrations were quanti- ﬁed by the BCA method. 25 μg of protein were loaded and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The primary antibodies, including rabbit anti- p-JNK (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA), LC3, p62, SLC7A11 (1:2000 dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and GPX4 (1:2000 dilution; Protein- tech, Chicago, USA), mouse anti- 𝛽-actin (1:2000 dilution; Proteintech, Chicago, USA), FTH1 (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were used. Protein concentrations of each sample were measured using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, MA, USA). The blots were visualized using the Tanon Chemiluminescent Imaging System Adv.

The protein load was normalized to 𝛽-actin and quantiﬁed using the Image J software (NIH, MD, USA). In Vivo Anti-Tumor Therapy: All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Ethics Committee of China Agricultural University. Female Balb/c nude mice (3 weeks) were supplied by SPF Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The MCF-7 tumor model was established by subcutaneously in- jecting 1 × 107 cells (suspended in 100 μL of PBS) into the right armpit of mice. Once the tumor volume reached 200–250 mm3, tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into ﬁve groups (n = 5), which were intravenously injected with (1) saline; (2) DOX (2.4 mg kg−1); (3) ZIF-8 (8.6 mg kg−1); (4) ZFC (8.6 mg kg−1); (5) DZFC (8.6 mg kg−1) every three days. In the DOX and DZFC groups, the ﬁnal dose of DOX in each group was equal to 2.4 mg kg−1 body weight. Body weight and tumor volumes of tumor- bearing mice were recorded every two days following drug administration. The tumor volumes were calculated according to the following formula: volume = (length × width2) / 2. The mice were sacriﬁced on the 21st day after the ﬁrst dose. Tumors were harvested and cell death was assessed using a TUNEL staining kit. In addition, the tumor states were recorded during the experiments and the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rates (%) were calculated according to the following formula: TGI (%) = 100%− [Vt∕V0](treatment)∕[Vt∕V0](control) × 100% (3) Where Vt is the tumor volume at the end of the experiment, V0 is the tumor volume at the beginning of the experiment. Biodistribution of DZFC In Vivo: The mice were sacriﬁced on the 21st day after the ﬁrst treatment dose. The heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and tumor were collected, and ICP-MS was used to determine the concentra- tion of Zn and Fe in tissues. MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 5), which were intravenously injected with DOX (2.4 mg kg−1)orDZFC(8.6mgkg−1), separately. At predetermined time points (1, 2, and 6 h), the mice were sacriﬁced to collect the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and tumor. Liquid chromatography-mass spec- trometry was used to detect the concentration of DOX in tissues. Immunohistochemical Staining: Paraformaldehyde (4%) was utilized to ﬁx tumor tissues, followed by paraﬃn-embedded sections. Rabbit anti- ki67, GPX4, LC3, p62, and SLC7A11, mouse anti-FTH1 antibodies were employed for immunohistochemical staining. The staining protocol and the semi-quantitative scoring were followed in the previous study.[89] Assessment of Safety In Vivo: Speciﬁc pathogen free (SPF) Balb/c mice (female, 20–22 g,) were randomly divided into ﬁve groups (n = 5ineach group), i.e., vehicle control, DOX, ZIF-8, ZFC, and DZFC treatment groups, respectively. Each mouse in the vehicle control, DOX, ZIF-8, ZFC, and DZFC treatment groups were injected intravenously with saline, DOX (2.4 mg kg−1), ZIF-8 (8.6 mg kg−1), ZFC (8.6 mg kg−1), andDZFC(8.6mg kg−1), respectively. In the DOX and DZFC groups, the ﬁnal dose of DOX in each group is equal to 2.4 mg kg−1 body weight. One week after ad- ministration, the mice were humanely sacriﬁced. To evaluate the poten- tial toxicity of nanoparticles in vivo, blood and major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) were harvested for analysis of blood biochemical parameters and histopathology.
