Abdel-Kader Foreword Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a photochemistry-based approach that uses light to activate speciﬁc chemicals that, in the activated state, impart cytotoxicity. His- torically, the concept of combining light with a chemical agent dates back over 5000 years when ancient civilizations in Egypt and India applied this combination to treat several disorders. It is therefore most appropriate that this book, entitled Photodynamic Therapy: From Theory to Application, is the result of a workshop and conference organized by Prof. Mahmoud H. Abdel-kader in Cairo, Egypt, a birthplace of early PDT, under the sponsorship of the German University in Cairo. Although PDT has received regulatory approval worldwide for several indi- cations, it has by no means achieved the recognition and the breadth of applica- tions that it deserves. There have been major milestones in both the basic understanding of the process of PDT and expanded vision of its applications. Perhaps a clearer integrated document that brings these together will help show the full potential of PDT where the best is yet to come. With this purpose in mind, Prof. Abdel-kader has strived to present key aspects of the application of PDT in medicine and society, while providing a strong basic science component to the book. The authors are experts in the ﬁeld and have made major contributions to its evolution to bring it to its current state. Each chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of the speciﬁc aspect of PDT that it is dedicated to. The book starts with a chapter on the History of Photodynamic Therapy, followed by chapters on fundamentals of photochemistry/photophysics, basic molecular biological mechanisms, and emerging variants such as photo- chemical internalization. There are sections on the applications of PDT to path- ogen destruction, new antibiotic susceptibility diagnostics, and speciﬁc clinical applications written by experts practicing PDT. I anticipate that, with the breadth of basic and applied aspects of PDT, this book could serve as a standard reference for researchers and students at all levels, as well as clinical specialists interested in the topic, and those in industry exploring new areas for development. Boston, MA, USA Tayyaba Hasan, Ph.D. vii Preface I think you might dispense with half your doctors if you would only consult Dr. Sun more —Henry Ward Beecher Light was used thousands of years ago by the Egyptians, Chinese, and Indians for the treatment of certain skin diseases; however, the actual birth of photody- namic therapy (PDT) was established roughly 100 years ago by the work of Scientists, namely Raab, von Tappeiner, and Finsen. Current interest in PDT only resurfaced in the early 1970s with the emergence of the water-soluble photosen- sitizer Hematoporphyrin Derivatives (HPD). Photodynamic therapy is a promising new modality for cancer treatment, which involves the combination of a photosensitizing agent, which is selectively taken up and retained by Tumor cells, and light of an appropriate wavelength. Separately, each of these factors is harmless; however, when they are combined in the pres- ence of oxygen, cytotoxic reactive oxygen species are produced, which leads to irreversible cellular damage and causes cell death and tumor destruction. It is a treatment modality for the management of cancer that can be added to surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted molecular therapies. The idea of writing a book on PDT came to me over 20 years ago. I was encouraged to pursue this vision after I obtained impressive results in the control of noxious insects and parasites that represent one of the biggest health problems in Egypt, especially the Schistosoma, which Egyptians have been suffering from since ancient Egyptian times. The successful ﬁeld application using PDT for the control of Malaria in African swamps was the real challenge and has shown to be a promising implementation of PDT. However, as one can realize from the extensive work published every day, that there is rapid progress in the clinical application. It is worth mentioning, that the greatest progress in PDT has been in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors. The driving force to initiate the book process was when an international con- ference on Photodynamic Therapy was held in the German University in Cairo (GUC) on February 2, 2012. I was honored to be the chairperson of this conference and most of the Authors that contributed to the book participated as keynote speakers. I shared my vision with my colleagues, and they all willingly welcomed the idea and agreed to contribute to the book. ix This book will acquaint readers with the history and basic principles of PDT, as well as the fundamentals of the theory, methods, and instrumentation of clinical diagnosis and treatment of cancer. It will also discuss nononcological applications such as functional targeting of bacteria, treatment of microbial infection and vector control of Malaria, Filaria, and Dengue Fever, and the control of other parasites and noxious insects. The Authors, all experts and pioneers in their ﬁeld, discuss the reasons behind the treatment with PDT along with its advantages and pitfalls. This comprehensive book is unique in its structure as it combines both the theory and application of PDT. It is also worth mentioning that this book will tackle state-of-the art research and ﬁll in the holes left by other literatures. Since both Scientists and Physicians have contributed to this book, this cooperation will hopefully assist in bridging the gap between the bench and the clinic. Photodynamic Therapy: From Theory to Application will be considered a standard reference for researchers of different levels whether they are postgraduate students or active researchers in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and biophysics. It will also be in high demand for physi- cians and specialists working on medical diagnosis and treatment in the ﬁeld of cancer, antimicrobial PDT, as well as the photodynamic control of parasites and noxious insects.

Unlike other living organisms, trees are constantly growing. This is especially true in the case of our PDT tree, which is continually growing and never ceases to develop. The roots of the PDT tree represent the origins of PDT, which started out as heliotherapy (light therapy) and dates back to Ancient Egypt, India, and China. The development of PDT, symbolized by the trunk, started out when PDT was reintroduced by Arnold Rikli and ends with the approval of the ﬁrst PDT drug in 1999. PDT involves three key components: a photosensitizer (PS), a light source, and tissue oxygen. The branches of the PDT tree portray this deﬁnition of PDT, the different photo- sensitizers, light sources, and oxygen, along with the products of this combination, which are the various oncological and non-oncological applications. 2 Chapter 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy Mahmoud H. Abdel-Kader From Ancient Egyptians to Present Day 1.1 Introduction Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a form of phototherapy that involves three key components: a photosensitizer, a light source, and tissue oxygen. When these components are combined together, they become toxic to the targeted cells [1]. The wavelength of the light source needs to be appropriate for exciting the pho- tosensitizer (ps) to produce reactive oxygen species ‘‘ROS’’. These ROS are generated during PDT through two types of reactions. Type I reaction involves electron/hydrogen transfer directly from the ps, producing ions, or electron/ hydrogen abstraction from a substrate molecule to form free radicals. Type II reaction produces the electronically excited and highly reactive state of oxygen known as singlet oxygen [2]. PDT is used clinically to treat a wide range of oncological and nononcological medical conditions [3] and is recognized as a treatment strategy that is both minimally invasive and minimally toxic [4]. PDT has been used for many years, but is only now becoming widely accepted and utilized, even though it has many advantages over other types of treatments. First, PDT avoids systemic treatment since treatment occurs only where light is delivered. Therefore, it is not necessary for the patient to undergo systemic treatment when treating localized disease and side effects are also avoided. Another advantage is that PDT is selective. The photosensitizing agent will selectively accumulate in cancer cells and the surrounding normal tissues are spared. PDT can also be used when surgery is not possible. If a patient has cancer in an organ or part of an organ that cannot be removed surgically (e.g., the upper bronchi of the lung), PDT can still treat the site. Moreover, it is a procedure that is M.

Unlike radiation therapy, PDT can be used again and again. Hence, it offers a means of long-term management of cancer even if complete cure is not possible [4]. 1.2 Phototherapy (Origin of PDT) The origin of light as a therapy in medicine and surgery can be traced from ancient times to modern days. Phototherapy began in Ancient Egypt, Greece, and India but disappeared for many centuries and was rediscovered by western civilization at the beginning of the twentieth century [5] (Fig. 1.1). Long ago, it was thought that sunlight was the only aspect in the cure of disorders such as vitiligo, psoriasis, rickets, skin cancer and even psychosis, i.e., sunlight was given all the credit. This treatment process (using sunlight) is known as phototherapy or, as it was previously called, heliotherapy. As science advanced, however, it was found that there were usually endogenous substances involved when curing these disorders and that the photodynamic process was a more accurate mechanism for explaining the healing powers of light [6, 7]. The practice of phototherapy, or heliotherapy as it was once called, dates back to ancient times. Early reports on the use of heliotherapy were found to date back to about 3000 BC in Ancient Egypt and India [6, 7]. In Ebers Papyrus, 1550 BC, ancient Egyptians utilized phototherapy using plants like the Ammi majus, parsnip, parsley, and Saint-John’s-wort to make a powder that was applied on depigmented lesions [6]. When the patient was exposed to sunlight, it led to skin pigmentation, an effect that is similar to sunburn [6, 7]. Also, in one of India’s sacred books, Atharava-Veda 1400 BC, patients suffering from vitiligo were given certain plant extracts of the Bavachee plant, the Psoralea corylifolai, and asked to stand in the sunlight for some time [6]. Phototherapy was introduced in China by Lingyan Tzu-Ming in the ﬁrst century BC during the Han dynasty [7]. Four centuries later, during the Tang dynasty, it became a ritual practice where people used to expose a piece of green paper with Fig. 1.1 Ancient Egyptians worshipped the sun, which eventually led them discover the connection between sunlight and health [7].

Abdel-Kader red dye to sunlight, soak it in water, and consume it to beneﬁt from some of the healing powers of the sun [7, 8]. It was during the second century BC that phototherapy ﬁrst got the name ‘‘hel- iotherapy’’ by the Greek doctor Hippocrates, who was called the ‘‘Father’’ of medical science [4]. He was the ﬁrst Greek to practice medicine as an empirical science at a time when it was practiced only by priests. Hippocrates recommended sunlight for restoration of health. He had ﬁrst known about the healing powers of sunlight from his travels to Egypt, where sunlight treatment was well-known [6, 7, 9]. The Romans who followed continued to utilize sunlight as a treatment, espe- cially for skin diseases. They invented the ‘‘Therms’’ which are historically famous Roman public baths set in sunlight. With the decline of the Roman Empire and the spread of Christianity, Roman baths and the concept of heliotherapy disappeared [6, 7, 9]. Later on, in the thirteenth Century, Ibn El-bitar described in his book, Mofradat Al Adwiya ‘‘Terminologies of Pharmaceuticals’’ the treatment of vitiligo with a tincture of honey and powdered Aatrillal seeds (that was later classiﬁed as Ammi majus). Administration of this tincture was both topical and oral followed by exposure to direct sunlight for 1–2 h [10]. It was not until the late 1800s and early 1900s that phototherapy began to ﬂourish again. Arnold Rikli, the Swiss natural healer and physician, reintroduced the healing powers of sunlight that had been forgotten for many centuries [9]. In this regard, this is why he is often considered the pioneer of modern phototherapy. Although he was the ﬁrst to draw the world’s attention toward the value of light, air and sunbaths, he was not well-known since most of his writings were not translated into English [11]. One of his ﬁrst great accomplishments was the establishment of a National Medicine Institute in the year 1855, in Bled, Slovenia [12]. For as long as 50 years, Arnold Rikli worked on developing natural therapies that are still valid today. His famous quote: ‘‘Water is good, Air is better and Light is best of all’’, is regarded as the core of heliotherapy [6]. Phototherapy, found useful in the treatment of lupus vulgaris, was used for the treatment of two other diseases: pulmonary tuberculosis and rickets. Following the same evolution processes, treatment attempts started with the utilization of sunlight which was then replaced by artiﬁcial ultraviolet (UV) radiation sources. By the end of the ﬁrst quarter of the twentieth century, phototherapy became famous and widely applied in northern Europe and northern cities of North America [6, 7, 13]. A great contributor to the foundation of modern phototherapy was the Danish doctor Niels Ryberg Finsen (1860–1904) [6]. He owned a medical institute in Copenhagen to which he attached a sun garden, where he allowed his patients to sunbathe in the sunlight in an attempt to cure lupus vulgaris (skin tuberculosis) and prevent scarring in patients with smallpox [6, 14]. In his ﬁrst attempts he used natural sunlight, but he soon changed to artiﬁcial light sources or ﬁltered sunlight. In 1893, he realized that the skin of smallpox patients showed best results with red light. Later in 1903, he demonstrated the beneﬁcial effect of UV rays on the human body; this led to his attempt at the artiﬁcial generation of UV rays. First, he separated UV from infrared and visible radiation using devices containing quartz 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy 5 lenses and ﬁlters. Then, he used UV radiation from the carbon arc lamp for the treatment of skin tuberculosis. The outcome of this invention was a Nobel Prize in medicine [6] (Fig. 1.2). These lamps were replaced afterward by much more convenient sealed quartz mercury—vapor lamps in 1904 that were cooled by water or air and were designed by Kromayer, a German dermatologist [7]. Such lamps were more efﬁcient sources of UV radiation than carbon arc ones [7]. Nowadays, a wide range of coherent and noncoherent sources can be used. Laser sources include; dye lasers pumped by argon, or metal vapor lasers and frequency-doubled neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet lasers (Nd: YAG). The nonlaser sources include tungsten ﬁlament, xenon arc, metal halide, and ﬂuorescent lamps. New exciting developments such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and femtosecond lasers are also being used [15]. 1.3 Photosensitizers The idea of using a dye as a ps came from an observation by Oscar Raab, a student of Professor H. Tappeiner at the Pharmacological Institute of the Ludwig Maxi- milian University of Munich, in the winter of 1897–1898. He noted that the toxic effect of acridine dye on paramecia was minimal on a day where there was a thunderstorm in comparison to its efﬁcacy on a normal day. From this observation, he concluded that light, in some way, activates the acridine dye to kill paramecia. In other words, he hypothesized that acridine dye converts light into an active chemical energy, a ﬁnding that formed the basis of PDT [6] (Fig. 1.3). Professor H. Tappeiner was considered one of the pioneers of photobiology. He introduced the term ‘‘Photodynamic Action’’ (Photodynamische Wirkung) in 1904. In 1903–1905, the von Tappeiner group started to investigate the efﬁcacy of PDT on tumors and other skin diseases such as lupus of the skin and condylomata of the Fig. 1.2 Set of apparatus devised by Finsen for treating lupus.

Abdel-Kader female genitalia using different dyes such as eosin, ﬂuorescein, sodium dichlo- roanthracene disulfonate and Grubler’s Magdalene red. These dyes were mostly applied topically; however, in some cases, intratumoral injections were also attempted. Results of these studies were favorable [6]. In 1905, H. Tappeiner and H. Jesionek investigated the effect of the ps, eosin (Fig. 1.4), on facial basal cell carcinoma after long-term exposure either to sunlight or arc-lamp light (Fig. 1.5). This treatment caused total tumor resolution and a 12-month relapse-free period in two-thirds of the patients. Tappeiner’s group later performed several studies on PDT and found out that the underlying mechanism of PDT involved ROS which implied that oxygen was required for this kind of therapy [16]. The most important event in the advance of PDT is the discovery and devel- opment of hematoporphyrin (hp) (Fig. 1.6). It was produced by Scherer as an impure form when he separated iron from dried blood by the addition of sulfuric acid in 1841. The spectrum and ﬂorescence of this compound were then described by Thudichun in 1867 and in 1871 Hoppe-Seyler gave it its name. The photo- dynamic properties of hp were studied on paramecia, erythrocytes, mice, guinea pigs and humans after exposure to sunlight in the period of 1908–1913 [6]. In 1908, Hausmann started performing experiments on hp toxicity [13]. Soon after, he performed experiments on white mice and realized that the phototoxic effects were dependent on the ps and light doses. He hypothesized that these phototoxic effects led primarily to peripheral tissue damage [17]. Studying the phototoxic effect of hp on humans was ﬁrst attempted by the German doctor Friedrich Meyer Betz in 1912. He self-administered 200 mg intravenously and then exposed himself to sunlight. Due to the phototoxic effect of hp, he suffered from edema and hyperpigmentation for more than 2 months following the injection [6] (Fig. 1.7). The next important phase in the discovery of hp was the observation of its tumor-localizing properties. In 1924 Policard ﬁrst observed that UV radiation produced red ﬂuorescence in experimental rat sarcomas and hypothesized that the ﬂuorescence was associated with endogenous hp accumulation. He associated this accumulation with the secondary infection of hemolytic bacteria [6]. However, years later, when Kordler observed similar ﬂuorescence in other tumors not involving bacteria (breast carcinoma), it was realized that the ﬂuorescence was due Fig. 1.3 Acridine general structure Fig. 1.4 Eosin Y structure 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy 7 to the presence of endogenous porphyrins. In 1942, Auler and Banzer were most likely the ﬁrst to study the accumulation of injected porphyrins in tumors. They injected tumor-bearing rats with hp and found out that it accumulated in primary and metastatic tumors as well as in lymph nodes. When the rats were exposed to light, promising results were observed [6]. In 1948, Figge and coworkers proposed the use of porphyrins as a treatment for cancer when they observed the high afﬁnity of porphyrins toward not only malignant cells, but also all rapidly dividing cells including embryonic and regenerating cells [18]. This implied that sensitive organs Fig. 1.5 Eosin on facial basal cell carcinoma after long-term exposure either to sunlight or arc-lamp light Fig. 1.6 Hematoporphyrin structure Fig. 1.7 Meyer Betz self administration of hematoporphyrin, 1912.

In the 1950s, Richard Cremer introduced the treatment of jaundice in newborn babies using phototherapy [6]. The following phase was the discovery of hematoporphyrin derivatives ‘‘HpD’’. It was a giant step forward in the evolution of PDT. This was done by S. Schwartz who was the ﬁrst to observe that hp itself was impure and consisted of a mixture of porphyrins and other impurities. S. Schwartz managed to separate them by treat- ment with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and acetic acid. He found out that hp itself had poor tumor-localizing properties and was a weak phototoxic agent compared to other components in the mixtures ‘‘which were later called, HpD’’. These derivatives were two times more phototoxic than hp itself [6]. HpD was used to diagnose tumors by S. Schwartz, in the year 1960 [19]. In the same year, Lipson and Baldes carried out a study where they concluded that systemic HpD followed by endoscopic control should be used for diagnosis of tumors [6]. A few years later, in 1966, Lipson and coworkers investigated the potential selective and destructive effect of HpD on an extended recurrent ulcerated cancer of the mammary gland in a female patient after exposure to ﬁltered light from a xenon lamp [20]. In 1976, J. F. Kelly and M. E. Snell examined the efﬁcacy of HpD against human bladder tumors implanted in immunocompromised mice and pro- nounced selective tumor destruction was observed [6, 21]. The modern era of PDT began with the pioneering work of Dougherty and coworkers at the Roswell Park Memorial Cancer Institute in Buffalo in the 1970s. They started puriﬁcation of HpD by removing the monomers and called the product Photofrin. Later, in 1978, they used HpD for cutaneous or subcutaneous cancer treatment using lasers as an alternative to arc lamps since lasers have the advantage of using ﬂexible ﬁbers [5, 6, 16] to avoid damage of normal skin since large HpD doses were required for extended tumors [22]. The Ammi majus plant, another natural ps, which was used by the Ancient Egyptians, was analyzed by Fahmy et al. an Egyptian pharmacologist, for its constituents and found that it contained the natural anaerobic photosensitizers psoralens (furocumarins), namely 8-methoxypsoralen ‘‘8-MOP’’ and 5-meth- oxypsoralen (5-MOP) [10]. El Mofty started to treat vitiligo patients with 8-MOP and sun exposure. The mechanism was found to be based on the photo-activation of psoralens, which, when active, induce vesiculation in the skin and cause re- epithelialization and repigmentation of depigmented skin [23] (Fig. 1.8). After Fahmy et al. separated 8-MOP, PUVA (Psoralens ? UVA treatment) appeared by the year 1974 [24]. PUVA was a combined treatment of 8-MOP and Ultraviolet-A phototherapy [25]. 8-MOP was the most important compound from the psoralen plant extract, since it was discovered that it inhibits the DNA S-phase ‘‘synthesis phase’’ of the cell cycle. Therefore, it began to be used for the treatment of psoriasis [26]. There are three forms of this treatment (oral, topical, and bath PUVA) [25, 26]. As this issue gained more interest, Honigsmann used 5-MOP as an alternative to 8-MOP to reduce the incidence of side effects [27]. However, side effects due to UV-A compared to those of UV-B were still apparent, namely the increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer [28]. After that the use of PUVA started to decline with the development of narrowband UV-B, which is 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy 9 much more effective and safer than UV-A and broadband UV-B. Moreover, it is well tolerated by patients when taken at sub-erythemogenic doses. Therefore, it represents an important modality for treatment of psoriasis [29]. Recently, ps were categorized according to direct chemical structure into three broad families: Porphyrin, Chlorines and Dyes. The ﬁrst family consists of hp and its derivatives e.g., Photofrin, Photosan and Photocan [30]. They differ in the fractions of their monomers, dimers and oligomers [15]. From the photosynthesis process (the primary natural process that involves light), the second family, chlorophyll-like substances named chlorines, was discovered. The degradation products of chlorophyll, the purines and chlorophyll-like substances in bacteria and algae, e.g., bacteriochlorins were also found to possess excellent photosen- sitizing properties. The third family, which was discovered earlier but is still of great potential, are the dyes discovered by Raab in 1897 e.g., Phthalocyanine and Naphthalocyanine [30]. These families can be further categorized into three generations. Examples of ﬁrst-generation ps from the porphyrin family are hp (and its derivatives) which are comprised of endogenous ps originating from cells that produce their own ps [31]. Examples of second-generation ps are Chlorin e6 ‘‘Ce6’’ (Chlorines), Phthalocy- anine and Naphthalocyanine (Dyes), among others. The third generation includes monoclonal antibodies that bind selectively to an antigen on cancer cells, which is still in progress [30, 31]. Many ps’ have been synthesized or discovered. These ps’ have different characteristics and different beneﬁts. Therefore throughout the years, various studies have taken place in order to explore new clinical applications, as well as to investigate each ps. Each ps has its own history of studies that explains its uses and development and will be represented throughout the rest of the chapter. 1.4 Hematoporphyrins and its Derivatives Hp is one of the most important and widely used ps known. Therefore, many studies have been performed to investigate the effect of this Ps for different applications. Studies using HpD go back as early as 1980 when Perria et al. who was the ﬁrst to use PDT in the treatment of human gliomas, concluded that high dose photoradiation of HpD could be used as an adjuvant to radiotherapy and surgery and have no further complications [32]. Further studies throughout the Fig. 1.8 Psoralens structure 10 M. H. Abdel-Kader years have been done by different scientists to compare HpD efﬁcacy in PDT. The results of one of these studies concluded that porphyrins achieve selective tumor killing and sparing of normal brain with a maximal depth of tumor, as mentioned by Karagianis et al. in 1996 [33]. In 2003, Szurko et al. found out that the pho- todynamic action of different types of porphyrins was able to inhibit growth of melanoma at nontoxic concentrations when cell death was caused by necrosis [34]. Studies made by Daicoviciu et al. in 2010, where they evaluated rats subcutane- ously administered with Walker 256 carcinoma. They demonstrated that porphy- rins could be used efﬁciently in in vivo PDT treatment [35]. More studies are being examined daily. One of the latest is a study by Li et al. in 2013 examining the effect of hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether ‘‘HMME’’-mediated PDT, which is a promising porphyrin-related ps, on the mitochondria of canine breast cancer cells. Results attributed damages of mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial dys- function [36]. 1.4.1 Photofrin Although hp is an important photosensitizer, we cannot neglect the importance of other photosensitizers. One of the widely used derivatives of hp is photofrin. Attention has been drawn to it in a number of studies, from the 1980s until modern day. A study performed by Muller and Wilson in 1995 showed that photofrin-PDT prolonged the survival of patients suffering from malignant gliomas [37]. In 2000, Marks et al. performed phase I/II trial on patients with recurrent pituitary ade- nomas and outcomes were very satisfying with improvement of visual acuity or ﬁeld defects in majority of the patients, along with a decrease of hormone levels in functional adenoma patients, and a reduction of tumor volume [38]. Saczko et al. conducted an in vitro study in 2005 that showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells in human Beidegröm Melanoma ‘‘BM’’ cell lines increased when the period of irradiation or the concentration of photofrin increased [39]. Moreover, an interesting preclinical study in 2006, performed by Gomer et al. showed that Photofrin-mediated PDT strongly activated angiogenic growth factors, proteinases and Cyclooxygenase-2 ‘‘COX 2’’ derived prostaglandins within the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, it has been reported that, to enhance the effective- ness of PDT, inhibitors of such angiogenic and proinﬂammatory pathways should be used [40]. 1.4.2 Endogenous Photosensitizers Endogenous photosensitizers are an interesting type of photosensitizers that are found in the body. Examples of these Ps are Ribofalvin (vitamin B12)[41] and Protoporphyrin IX (Pp IX). PpIX is an intermediate of heme synthesis; its 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy 11 physiological concentration is low due to the controlled expression of its precursor 5-Aminolevulinic acid ALA whose expression is controlled through feedback via Heme concentration. ALA is a prodrug that is enzymatically converted to the active ps PPIX. Exogenous administration of ALA breaks the feedback control, causing the accumulation of PpIX [31] (Fig. 1.9). Many studies have been performed regarding the use of endogenous ps in treating different tumors such as brain tumors. In 1998 Lilge et al. found that ALA- induced PpIX is useful for treating most adult intracranial neoplasms photody- namically [42]. In 2003, Stummer et al. examined new methods for the complete removal of malignant gliomas, which cannot be easily achieved by normal radical resections. One of the methods was removal of the glioma, then administration of the metabolic precursor 5-ALA, which appeared to be advantageous [43]. A few years later, Stummer et al. performed another study; results indicated that com- plete resection of gliomas was enhanced by aid of the ﬂuorescence mediated by ALA, which, in turn, enhanced progression-free survival [44]. In 2006, Nowis et al. performed a study using a DNA-microarray analysis, heme oxygenase-1 ‘‘HO-1’’ induction was observed in colon adenocarcinoma cells that showed an increased resistance to PDT. When an inhibitor of heme oxygenase -1, zinc (II) propoporphyrin IX was used, the effect of PDT treatment was enhanced [45]. Further studies were done in 2007 on the ps ALA by Karmakar et al. They utilized ALA to induce apoptosis of human malignant glioblastoma photodynamically and study the underlying mechanism of apoptosis. The results of their experiment indicated activation of proteolytic pathways, and investigated the mechanism of action [46]. Fig. 1.9 Synthesis of protoporphyrin IX.

H. Abdel-Kader 1.4.3 Second-Generation Porphyrins Since porphyrin-based ps have dominated the PDT ﬁeld, there has been further progress regarding PDT as a treatment method in various studies. Thereby, the development of new ps has been essential. These newly discovered ps include second-generation porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives as well as third-generation ps which have arisen with the aim of alleviating the problems encountered with ﬁrst-generation porphyrins and improving the efﬁcacy of PDT. In 1999, Schmidt et al. investigated the possible use of a second-generation ps called benzopor- phyrin derivative ‘‘BPD’’ in PDT using the LED technology. Their results illus- trated that BPD and LED light sources minimize toxicity of normal brain tissue at doses that can cause glioma cell apoptosis in vitro when used at proper concen- trations and light doses. Results suggested that BPD is a possible new-generation ps that could be used for the treatment of different malignant brain disorders [47]. Verteporﬁn Verteporﬁn (Fig. 1.10) is a second-generation benzoporphyrin derivative that is indicated for the treatment of patients with predominantly classic subfoveal cho- roidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, or presumed ocular histoplasmosis [48]. Studies were performed on the use of verteporﬁn to treat lesions that don’t respond to conventional therapy such as choroidal melanoma. Hu et al. in 2002 used a liposomal preparation of verteporﬁn against pigmented choroidal melanoma and evaluated tumor destruction suggesting that PDT can be used for the man- agement of the tumors [49]. Then, in 2003, Barbazetto et al. performed an experiment on patients who did not respond to previous conventional therapy such as brachytherapy and transpupillary thermotherapy. Their results indicated that PDT may have the potential to manage choroidal melanoma; however, additional studies are required to prove this [50]. By the year 2005, a study applied PDT using verteporﬁn to animals with choroidal melanoma, and the animals responded to the treatment [51]. These studies conclude that PDT along with the use of Verteporﬁn can be used for the management of choroidal melanoma. Fig. 1.10 Verteporﬁn structure 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy 13 1.5 Chlorines Throughout the years, different chlorophyll analogues have been discovered or developed such as the ﬁrst-generation bacteriochlorins or second and third-gen- eration ps, e.g., chlorin e6. 1.5.1 Bacteriochlorin Some studies using these chlorophyll analogues focused on melanoma. In 2010, it was shown by Baldea et al. that PDT may be used as a method of treatment against melanoma, however, high melanin levels in melanomas can adversely affect PDT effectiveness and since the absorption of melanin is on the blue region of light, the photodynamic efﬁcacy signiﬁcantly decreases with photosensitizers in this absorption region. Another reason is the known antioxidant ability of melanin and its inhibition of ROS [52]. In the same year, Mroz et al. performed a study which demonstrated that three newly introduced bacteriochlorins overcame melanoma resistance successfully. They also proved that bacteriochlorins are superior to other ps such as Photofrin. [53]. Dabrowski et al. in 2012, studied the effect of sul- fonamide bacteriochlorin on melanoma on mice injected with the ps intraperito- neally and observed improvement in the median tumor growth delay, as well as better selectivity of the sulfonamide bacteriochlorin [54]. 1.5.2 Chlorin e6 (Ce6) Figure. 1.11 has been widely used as a second- and third-generation photosensi- tizer [55]. It is a reduced porphyrin, which is why they are structurally similar. Ce6 is a promising representative of the chlorines platform [56] since it has many advantages including low toxicity, easy synthesis and production, fast and sufﬁ- ciently selective accumulation in target tissue, and higher photosensitizing efﬁcacy over porphyrins or photofrin [55]. For these reasons, many researchers have made efforts to prepare and utilize Ce6 alone and with different carriers. In 1991, Bachor et al. investigated the difference in effect between free Ce6 and microsphere-bound Ce6 ‘‘Ce6-MS’’ on human bladder carcinoma. It was found that Ce6-MS was more efﬁcient than free Ce6 in causing photodynamic destruc- tion of human bladder carcinoma cells due to both the higher uptake and different mechanism of action of Ce6-MS. Furthermore, Ce6-MS are retained for a longer period of time intracellularly than are free Ce6 [57]. A study was carried out in 1997 by Schmidt et al. where low-density lipoprotein ‘‘LDL’’ was used as a carrier molecule. Results of this study showed that LDL-Ce6 conjugate increased the efﬁciency and selectivity of PDT [58]. Another study was performed in 2000, by 14 M. H. Abdel-Kader Gijsens et al. on breast adenocarcinoma using the conjugate Sn-Ce6 in order to achieve selective targeting to the breast adenocarcinoma cells which are known to over express epidermal growth factor ‘‘EGF’’ receptors. This led to the hypothesis that these receptors could be used as a carrier for SnCe6. It was concluded that the conjugates caused speciﬁc and potent photodynamic activity on the cells [59]. In a study performed in 2001, Hamblin et al. found that Ce6 has increased photo- toxicity in ovarian cancer cells when attached to polyethylene glycol ‘‘PEG’’ [60]. In 2004, results of a study performed by Sheleg et al. that evaluated the effect of Ce6 on skin metastases showed that there was complete regression and no recurrence during the study period after single or multiple PDT courses [61]. Jeong et al. 2011, performed a study that showed that the Ce6 conjugated to human serum albumin ‘‘HSA’’ has a more speciﬁc biodistribution toward tumor tissues and enhanced therapeutic results compared to the free form [62]. 1.5.3 Chlorophyll Derivatives (CpD) Abdel-Kader and his coworkers have recently focused their research on the newly discovered photosensitizer consisting of chlorophyll derivatives ‘‘CpD’’ for both oncological and nononcological uses. These ps are appealing because they can be easily obtained from natural resources. CpD have many advantages over other ps. It was found that the wavelength applicable (670 nm) to CpD was longer than that of HpD (630 nm) which meant that tissue penetration of CpD would be better than that of HpD. Also, superior cytotoxicity and higher cellular concentration were noted when CpD were used [63]. In 2012, Gomaa et al. examined the efﬁcacy of PDT using CpD on a breast cancer cell line. Results proved that chlorophyll derivatives are a better candidate for breast cancer cell toxicity, because of its higher efﬁcacy at tumor cell killing as well as its safety to normal cells. As illustrated from the results of the karyotyping and FISH technique, CpD is non- mutagenic and nontoxic to living cells [64]. Fig. 1.11 Chlorin-e6 structure 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy 15 1.5.4 Photochlor (HPPH) Photochlor, or 2-[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-alpha ‘‘HPPH’’ (Fig. 1.12) is a lipophilic, second-generation, chlorin-based ps. In 2001, Lobel et al. used HPPH or Photochlor in an in vivo study for treating rat malignant gliomas using PDT. They concluded that HPPH localized in tumor cells more than in normal brain cells and could be used as adjuvant therapy in treating gliomas [65]. 1.5.5 Temoporﬁn (mTHPC) Temoporﬁn, m-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin ‘‘mTHPC’’ (Fig. 1.13) is a second- generation ps (based on chlorin) used in PDT mainly to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. It is promoted by its brand name Foscan in the European Union. Temoporﬁn is photoactivated at 652 nm by red light. Patients can remain photosensitive for several weeks after treatment. In many regards mTHPC ﬁts many of the requirements of an ideal ps, and thus may be regarded as ‘‘better’’ than Photofrin. It can be prepared as a chemically pure compound and shows enrichment in tumor versus normal tissue. In addition, mTHPC requires smaller quantities for administration, shorter treatment times, and a lower light dose to achieve the desired PDT response [66]. Biel et al. in 2002 evaluated tumor response using Foscan-PDT in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer. Results were found to be a therapeutic option of signiﬁcant beneﬁt to patients with advanced head and neck cancer [67]. Campbell et al. in 2004 carried out a study demonstrating that mTHPC-PDT is a useful initial treatment for vulval intraepi- thelial neoplasia type III ‘‘VIN III’’ and has a very signiﬁcant beneﬁt over surgery. Patients were injected with mTHPC intravenously and the area of VIN was irra- diated with a diode laser. They were evaluated at different time intervals after treatment and results showed no recurrence of VIN at the original site in all patients reviewed. [68]. In 2012, Sayed et al. investigated foscan, its derivatives and their photocytotoxicity in human hepatocellular carcinoma ‘‘HCC’’. Results showed that Foscan and its derivatives can effectively induce early apoptotic Fig. 1.12 Photochlor structure 16 M. H. Abdel-Kader responses in HCC cells [69]. In 2013, Sherifa et al. performed another study on the novel ps, Fospeg\u0003, which is a liposomal formulation of the photosensitizer Fo- scan\u0003 (commercial name of mTHPC). The results indicate that fospeg-mediated PDT is a promising strategy for treatment of HCC and needs to be further explored in vivo [70]. 1.5.6 Talaporﬁn More ps were investigated in 2008 for their potential use of PDT in brain tumors. One of these was talaporfrin (Fig. 1.14), a second-generation ps derived from chlorophyll. Namatame et al. investigated a combination of talaporﬁn sodium ‘‘TS’’ and they came to the conclusion that talapofrin-PDT caused apoptosis as well as coagula- tion necrosis in rat C6 glioma [71]. Also, in 2013, Tsutsumi et al. demonstrated that TS-induced glioma cell line apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner [72]. 1.6 Dyes As previously mentioned, Oscar Raab was the ﬁrst to propose the use of dyes as photosensitizers. Later, von Tappeiner performed studies using different types of dyes to examine the efﬁcacy of PDT. The most common dyes used now are phthalocyanines, which belong to the second-generation ps, phthalocyanine dem- onstrates higher absorption in the 650–800 nm range and short tissue accumulation [73]. They are relevant for clinical use due to their strong absorption in the far-red spectral band [6]. In 2007, Kolarova et al. preformed a study using- Chloro-Alu- minium phthalocyanines ‘‘ClAlPcS’’ along with a semiconductor laser (as the light dose). This procedure was shown to have a lethal effect on melanoma cells [74]. In 2010, Robertson et al. concluded that the new ps metallophthalocyanine ‘‘MPc’’, Fig. 1.13 Temoporﬁn structure 1 History of Photodynamic Therapy 17 in combination with laser, produced a better outcome in malignant melanoma destruction and had ideal ps characteristics [75]. In 2011, Maduray et al. performed an in vitro study on different cells with the aim of investigating the possible cytotoxic effects of the water-soluble photosensitizer zinc tetrasulfophthalocya- nines ‘‘ZnTSPc’’. It was concluded that when ZnTSPc is used in low concentrations and activated by the proper light dose it results in the death of the melanoma cells while sparing the healthy tissues from such damage [76]. 1.7 Conclusion Phototherapy is a treatment modality that dates back to ancient times. The different investigations and studies that have been performed throughout the years have led to its development and given us the PDT we know today. It is now considered a promising, less invasive treatment method of malignant and premalignant diseases and has been approved for the treatment of certain types of neoplasms. The ﬁeld of PDT is now so large and the growing scientiﬁc understanding of the underlying photochemistry, biology, and physiology of PDT should be taken advantage of for the development of new and better clinical treatments. If more research studies were performed to help identify new indications as well as to expand those already existing, this may help propagate the awareness of PDT and its usefulness among the general public. PDT will have a great future if we are successful in making it better known. Since we are in the era of proof based science, it is expected that much effort will be put into studies and research on PDT, so that one day we can live in a world with accepted consensus on PDT. Each successful research and treatment will be an addition to patients and to the world of science and human- beings. Fig. 1.14 Talaporﬁn structure 18 M. H. Abdel-Kader References 1.

Steiner Abstract This chapter provides an introduction to the photophysical and photo- chemical fundamentals that should represent a useful scientiﬁc background for applicants of photodynamic therapy (The references given in the abstract provide some access to generally recommended textbooks or reviews of the various areas.). First, the absorption of light and the basics of spectrophotometry (Parson in Modern Optical Spectroscopy. With exercises and examples from biophysics and biochemistry.

Then follows a survey of photophysical processes with the characteristic pathways of radiationless and radiative decay of electron- ically excited states (Lakowicz in Principles of ﬂuorescence spectroscopy.

The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, 2003), are brieﬂy outlined. 2.1 Photophysics 2.1.1 Light and Color Their speciﬁc colors are one of the important sensory properties of chemical compounds. In nature, the green of leaves, the yellow, red and blue of ﬂowers, and the red of blood are prominent indicators of chlorophyll, ﬂavonoids, anthocyanins, and hemoglobin, respectively. What our vision senses as uniform, single colors, is usually the impression of light that can still be decomposed into a spectral con- tinuum of colors by the optical effect of dispersion exhibited by a prism or a grating. Spectrally pure light is characterized as electromagnetic radiation of a deﬁnite wavelength k. The range of wavelengths from about 400 nm to about 750 nm represents the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.1), that extends from the region of c-rays at the short wavelength end to the region of radio waves at the long wavelength end. The characteristic color of a chemical compound is due to its characteristic absorption of parts of the visible spectrum from the ambient white light. The remaining transmitted or remitted spectral mixture of light determines the color Fig. 2.1 a Regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and localization of the UV/vis range, b colors of the visible spectrum of a white light source, c colors of the visible spectrum after transmission through a solution of methylene blue, d perceived color of the methylene blue solution 26 U. E. Steiner that we see. However, it is the spectral characteristics of the absorbed light that carries the essential information on the electronic structure of the molecules and their concentration if we are dealing with dilute systems such as solutions. Quantitative measurements of the absorption characteristics in the UV to near infrared deﬁne the realm of UV/vis spectrophotometry or, in another term relating to the underlying physical process: electronic absorption spectroscopy. 2.1.2 Spectrophotometry The most convenient way to measure the absorption characteristics of a chemical compound is by employing a homogenous transparent solution in some solvent [1–3]. If the solution is dilute, it is usually justiﬁed to assume that the absorption characteristics are determined by the individual solute molecules. In a spectro- photometer, the transmission of light through a sample cuvette is measured as a continuous function of the wavelength. For relating the observed transmission to the absorption of the solute molecules it is important to eliminate any light attenuation effect due to the cuvette windows and the solvent. Such effects are due to reﬂection of some part of the incident light intensity at the outer and inner surfaces of the cuvette windows and to light scattering inside the solution (cf. Fig. 2.2). Therefore, it is convenient to compare the transmitted light of the sample cuvette to that of a similar reference cuvette containing only the solvent, thereby eliminating the role of all factors except for the absorption by the solute. If we denote the intensities transmitted behind the sample cuvette and the reference cuvette by IS and IR, respectively, when they are both hit by the same light intensity I0, the transparence T as related to pure absorption is deﬁned as T ¼ IS IR ð2:1Þ IS IR I0 sample reference reflexion losses scattering losses Fig. 2.2 Effects diminishing the transparency of a solution and separation of the absorption effect of the solute by comparing sample and reference 2 Fundamentals of Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Photobiology 27 According to Lambert’s law, T decreases exponentially with the optical path length d of the light (cf. Fig. 2.3): T ¼ 10\u0002k\u0003d ð2:2Þ The attenuation factor k is speciﬁc for the given solute, its concentration and the wavelength of the light. According to Beer’s law it is proportional to the con- centration c of the absorbing compound: k ¼ eðkÞ\u0003 c ð2:3Þ Here e(k) is the molar decadic absorption coefﬁcient. Although the penetration of light into an absorbing medium does not come to an end sharply, as shown in Fig. 2.3, the typical ‘‘penetration depth’’ is conventionally characterized by a ﬁnite length, given by dp \u0004 1 k \u0003 ln 10 ð2:4Þ After a path length dp, the light intensity has dropped to about 37 % of its initial value. Equation (2.3) is the basis for quantitative analytical determinations by pho- tometry. Here it is customary to introduce the absorbance A as a new quantity which is directly proportional to the concentration c: A \u0004 k \u0003 d ¼ e \u0003 c \u0003 d ð2:5Þ Introducing this expression into Eq. (2.2) we arrive at Lambert–Beer’s law T ¼ 10\u0002A ð2:6Þ A ¼\u0002 lg T ð2:7Þ pd Fig. 2.3 Lambert’s law for transmission T as a function of optical path length d for two attenuation factors k = 1 (black curve) and k = 2(red curve). The dashed line indicates the deﬁnition of the ‘‘penetration depth’’ dp 28 U. E. Steiner Customary spectrophotometers automatically record the wavelength depen- dence of the absorbance. Such records are called absorption spectra. Other than transmission spectra, they exhibit strict proportionality to the concentration of the sample at any wavelength (cf. Fig. 2.4). However, one should take care of spectral changes that may occur upon associations of molecules at higher concentrations. 2.1.3 Theoretical Basis of Absorption Spectra The simplest appearance of absorption spectra is found for isolated atoms in the gas phase. These spectra exhibit isolated sharp absorption lines, i.e., very narrow ranges of wavelength where light absorption does occur. As was ﬁrst shown by Bohr, these lines (more easily detected as emitted light after excitation of the atoms) reﬂect the pattern of energy quantization in the atoms. A key to his theory was Einstein’s suggestion that the energy of light is quantized, whereby the energy Eph of the light quanta (photons) is determined by the frequency m of the light: Eph ¼ hm ð2:8Þ Since, for a wave with frequency m and wavelength k the following equation holds m \u0003 k ¼ c ð2:9Þ where c is the speed of light, the photon energy can be also expressed by the wavelength Eph ¼ h \u0003 c k ð2:10Þ According to Bohr’s postulate, light can be only absorbed if the photon energy exactly matches the energy difference between two possible energy states n and m of the atom. Fig. 2.4 Absorption spectra of methylene blue in methanol at three different concentrations. According to which the absorbance can be calculated from the measured transmission T by 2 Fundamentals of Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Photobiology 29 DEnm ¼ hc k ð2:11Þ In case of an absorption spectrum, it is usually the energy spacing between the ground state, the normal state of the atom, and any of its higher (i.e., excited) states. These ideas are illustrated in Fig. 2.5. In case of molecular compounds in condensed media, the typical appearance of the absorption spectrum is as shown for the example of methylene blue in Fig. 2.4. It is characterized by an almost continuous absorption across the full wavelength range, however structured by broad absorption peaks and broad minima. The absorption peaks exhibit spectral widths of some 50–100 nm and they differ in their absolute heights (intensities). The spectral regions of the peaks are termed absorption bands. In the following we will clarify three questions: 1. What determines the positions of the bands? 2. What determines the widths of the bands? 3. What determines the intensities of the bands? The explanations are illustrated by Fig. 2.6. Here, a schematic absorption spec- trum of chlorophyll a is plotted over a vertical axis. We realize that, with reference to Eq. (2.10), the scales of photon energy and wavelength run in opposite directions. As in the atomic case, in the molecular case, too, the energy scale of the absorbed light has to be seen against the energy scale of the molecular energy levels. A molecular energy level scheme comprises much more levels than an atomic one, where energy can be only deposited in the form of electronic excitations. In molecules, the atoms can vibrate against each other. They can do so in N-6 modes Energy quantum number 1 2 3 4 0 ionization continuum energy level scheme ground state Bohr's frequency condition spectrum 0T→ 1 system photon nmE/hc λΔ= λ Fig. 2.5 Relation between absorption spectrum (right) and energy level scheme (left) in isolated atoms. The absorption spectrum, when plotted on a frequency scale, represents an image of the energy level scheme of the atom 30 U. E. Steiner (N-5 in linear molecules). The vibrational energy of each of these modes is quantized in multiples of hmvib, where mvib is the vibrational frequency of the mode. Thus, their energy level schemes represent uniformly spaced ladders with step widths much smaller than typical electronic excitation energies, but extending (as indicated by the dots in Fig. 2.6) up to typical bond breakage energies which are normally larger than the spacing between the electronic levels. In Fig. 2.6, the vibrational level structure is represented in a very schematic way, displaying just the vibrational progression of one representative mode. In reality N-6 (or N-5 if it is a linear molecule) such vibration energy ladders have to be superimposed. Since different vibrational modes can be excited to various degrees at the same time, the number of possible combinations of vibrational states increases drastically with increasing total vibrational energy. Apart from electronic excitation and vibration of the nuclei, a molecule can also rotate, which adds another, still ﬁner level substructure to the one depicted in Fig. 2.6. In solution, these rotational levels are broadened, because free rotations are hindered. Therefore, the total level scheme of a molecule in solution essentially corresponds to a continuum which accounts for the apparent continuous nature of the absorption spectrum. Nevertheless, the band structure of molecular absorption spectra shows, that on absorption of a photon, the transitions to any of the elec- tronic-vibrational-rotational (rovibronic) states are not equally probable. In the ﬁrst place, it is still the interaction of the electromagnetic light wave with the Fig. 2.6 Molecular energy level scheme and its relation to the molecular absorption spectrum.

The excitation of an electron occurs on a much shorter time scale than the period of a molecular vibration, such that, on the time scale of a vibration, the electronic excitation is practically instantaneous. Since the valence electrons excitable by light are responsible for the chemical bonds and for the forces on the atoms, when they vibrate out of their equilibrium positions, a rearrangement of the electron distribution on excitation may result in a change of forces between the atoms and thereby, after excitation, the molecule will start to vibrate stronger or weaker than before it was excited. The particular values of the shifts of vibrational potential curves between electronic ground and excited states will determine which electronic-vibrational (vibronic) level combination will have the highest probability of excitation. In a qualitative way, this relation is expressed in the Franck–Condon principle, in a quantitative way the intensity distribution over an absorption band is determined by the Franck–Condon factors of the vibrational levels that are connected by the transi- tion. In general, the position of a band maximum, i.e., the vibronic transition of highest probability, is not too far from the pure electronic transition. Therefore, the pattern of the band maxima positions is rather close to the purely electronic energy level scheme of a molecule. The widths of the bands are determined by the extent to which vibrations are excited together with the electron, and are therefore governed by the Franck–Condon principle. The electronic excitation energies can be qualitatively estimated from the molecular orbital picture of the electronic structure. In molecules it is customary to classify the orbitals according to their nodal properties with respect to the chemical bonds (cf. Fig. 2.7). If an orbital wave function does not change its sign when orbiting around a chemical bond, it is classiﬁed as a r-orbital. If there are two sign changes on a full circle around a bond, it is classiﬁed as a p-orbital. If there is no node along the chemical bond, the orbital is bonding, i.e., it causes attraction of the adjacent atoms. Orbitals with a node along the bond are antibonding, i.e., they cause repulsion between the adjacent atoms if populated by an electron. Anti- bonding orbitals are denoted by an asterisk in combination with the Greek symbol. π *π σ *σ Fig. 2.7 Representation of r, r*, p, and p* molecular orbitals in ethylene 32 U. E. Steiner In organic compounds containing atoms other than hydrogen and carbon, so-called hetero atoms such as nitrogen and oxygen, some of the electron pairs of the heteroatom do not participate in bonding or antibonding. These are called n-electrons (nonbonding electrons). Roughly, the energetic order of the various types of molecular orbitals is: r, p, n, p*, r*. Electronic transitions between these orbitals are assigned the labels of the orbitals involved. Hence, we may distinguish np*, nr*, pp*, and rr* transi- tions which are typically ordered in energy as shown in Fig. 2.8. The bands in the visible are usually of np*or pp* nature. Finally, we are left with the third of the questions posed above, regarding the intensity of the electronic absorption bands. This intensity can be interpreted as the probability per time unit of a molecule to undergo a certain transition in an electromagnetic ﬁeld of a given wavelength and strength, or else as the probability of absorption of a photon of a given energy on passing a certain number of uniformly distributed molecules. This process requires electric interaction between the electrons and the light ﬁeld. Classically, it can be described in analogy to the absorption of energy by an oscillating dipole antenna in a radio wave ﬁeld. We should note, however, that the energy eigenstates of the molecule are stationary, i.e., there is no oscillation of the electrons that could represent the dipole antenna. Such a situation, i.e., real oscillation of charge, occurs only when different energy eigenstates are coherently superimposed or mixed. Then the electron cloud oscillates with a frequency given by Bohr’s condition, Eq. (2.11). The rate at which this oscillator takes up energy from the radiation ﬁeld is proportional to the square of the electric dipole moment of the oscillating charge. The charge dis- tribution of the oscillator can be obtained by multiplying the wavefunctions of the two states involved in the transition. We will demonstrate this procedure for the transition between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in naphthalene. Since these orbitals are p-orbitals, we are dealing with a pp\u0005 transition. In Fig. 2.9, the representations of the orbitals and of the transition charge density distribution are shown. The charge distribution can be assigned to four partial dipoles, two weak ones pointing downward, two strong ones pointing upward.

The HOMO–LUMO transition in naphthalene gives rise to a moderately strong absorption band with a maximum absorption coefﬁcient of about 6,000 M-1 cm-1. It corresponds to the second band in the spectrum shown in Fig. 2.10. Note that a log-scale is used for the absorption coefﬁcient in order to accommodate bands of very different intensity in one diagram. It is also worth of note that, in general, excited electronic states cannot be precisely described by a single electron con- ﬁguration as we have assumed for the HOMO ? LUMO excitation in naphthalene, where it is rather well justiﬁed. In general, one has to mix different electron con- ﬁgurations to arrive at a realistic description of a speciﬁc excited state. For example, in naphthalene the ﬁrst and third excited states are approximately obtained from combining two conﬁgurations, one involving excitation of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO ? 1 orbital and the other from the HOMO-1 orbital to the LUMO orbital. Their combinations result in a lowest excited state with a very small transition dipole moment (band \u0002 in Fig. 2.10) and in the third excited state with a very large transition dipole moment (band ´ in Fig. 2.10) in the transition from the ground state to these states. For different types of transitions, the absorption coefﬁcients can vary over a very wide range. An overview of typical cases and orders of magnitude is presented in Table 2.1. 2.1.4 Photophysical Processes in the Excited State The general ‘‘map’’ for the processes taking place after electronic excitation of molecules is the so-called Jablonski scheme shown in Fig. 2.11 [4]. It shows two energy ladders, termed the singlet and the triplet system. Singlet and triplet refers to the spin multiplicity of an electronic state. In a singlet state, the spins of all HOMO LUMO transition charge density Fig. 2.9 HOMO and LUMO of naphthalene. Upper row: isocontour plot from an extended Hückel calculation. Middle row: Hückel MO coefﬁcient representation, Lower row: HOMO ? LUMO transition charge density with partial dipoles. Black and white circles represent positive and negative values, respectively, of molecular orbitals and the charge density 34 U. E. Steiner electrons are paired and the total spin is zero. For normal molecules with an even number of electrons, this is generally the case for the ground state which is therefore given the term symbol S0 (for the exception of molecular oxygen cf. below). In a triplet state, the spin angular momentum of two unpaired electrons adds up to a spin quantum number of 1. Since three different spatial orientations of such a spin can be distinguished, the multiplicity of the state is 3, hence the term triplet state. On excitation, at least two electrons will reside in singly occupied molecular orbitals. Hence the Pauli principle does no longer restrict their mutual spin alignment and singlet states as well as triplet states are possible. For states that can be described by a single electron conﬁguration, the triplet state is usually at lower energy than the singlet state because in triplet states the unpaired electrons still do avoid close encounters due to the Pauli principle, and therefore their average repulsion energy is less than for the corresponding singlet conﬁguration. Radiationless transitions. Let us follow the fate of a molecule after its exci- tation to a higher vibronic (i.e., electronically and vibrationally excited) state.

In a condensed medium, there are many collisions between the molecule and its surroundings, and the excess vibrational energy is easily transferred to the ‘‘cold’’ molecules of the medium. Thus, within typically an order of magnitude of 10-12 s, the molecule has undergone a vibrational relaxation to the more or less vibrationless excited electronic state. Further relaxation requires the intramolecular transformation of electronic energy into vibrational energy which is termed internal conversion. Since the steps of the electronic energy ladder are usually much larger than the vibrational energy quanta, such a transformation goes along with a strong change in the motional state of the nuclei and it is the harder to realize the larger the electronic energy gap (so-called energy gap law). Typical times for internal conversion steps between the higher excited states are on the order of 10-12 s. Since the energy gap between S1 and S0 is usually larger than between the higher states, the S1 ? S0 internal conversion is much slower, typically on the order of 10-9 s. A famous exception to this behavior is the case of azulene, where the S2 ? S1 internal conversion is much slower than the S1 ? S0 one, which however also reﬂects the rule of the energy gap law, because the S2 - S1 energy gap is exceptionally high in that case. Intersystem Crossing.

Steiner the light ﬁeld is too weak to compete with the effects of the electric ﬁeld com- ponent while it induces an electronic transition between different orbitals. How- ever, there is an intramolecular perturbation, spin–orbit coupling, which can cause spin ﬂips during radiationless and radiative transitions. Spin–orbit coupling is a relativistic effect that may be visualized as the action of an effective magnetic ﬁeld seen by the electrons while orbiting around the charged nuclei. Seen from the electron, the relative motion of the nucleus in an atom corresponds to a ring current that produces a magnetic ﬁeld along which the electron spin tends to align. The effect increases linearly with the orbital momentum of the electron, but much more strongly (to the fourth power) with the nuclear charge. In nonlinear organic molecules, the molecular orbitals have little directed orbital momentum. Thus, spin–orbit coupling effects in such molecules are usually weak and hence there is little mixing between singlet and triplet states. However, spin–orbit coupling effects can be enhanced by the presence of heavy atoms (i.e., with nuclei of high electric charge) and/or during transitions between orbitals that involve a rotation of a p-orbital at some hetero atomic center, such as occurring e.g., in transitions between np* and pp* excited states. Therefore, radiationless (and radiative, c.f. below) intersystem crossing processes are par- ticularly effective between singlet and triplet states differing in their electronic orbital nature. Apart from the strength of spin–orbit coupling between two electronic states, the electronic energy gap between them is the second important factor for the rate of a radiationless transition between a singlet and a triplet state or vice versa. The energy gap law holds in this case, too, just as for internal conversion processes between states of the same multiplicity. Therefore, the radiationless transition from T1 to S0 is much slower than from excited singlets to the triplet system. Typical orders of magnitude are 10-9 s for the latter and 10-2 s for the former. However, such numbers should be taken with care, because deviations by one or more orders of magnitude are possible, depending on the speciﬁc case. Photoluminescence. When looking at dye solutions, one often can observe some extra ‘‘glow’’ in the sample, adding to the spectrally ﬁltered transmitted light (cf. the photo of methylene blue bottles in Fig. 2.4). This phenomenon is due to a spontaneous, undirected emission of light and its spectral characteristics are spe- ciﬁc for the emitting molecules, but rather independent of the wavelength of the light absorbed. Spectrally, this photoluminescence appears in a band positioned on the long wavelength side of the ﬁrst absorption band and with a band shape resembling a mirror image of that absorption band. (cf. Fig. 2.11). If excited by a very short light pulse of less than a nanosecond, it is possible to observe the decay of the photoluminescence in time and to distinguish two components of very different life time: a short one, ﬂuorescence, with a life time characteristic of the S1 state and a long-lived one, phosphorescence, with a life time characteristic of the T1 state. While the ﬂuorescence intensity may come close to the intensity of the absorbed light (i.e., may reach a quantum yield of 1), at room temperature, the phosphorescence is usually very weak because the emission is spin-forbidden and its rate is much smaller than the rate of radiationless deactivation of T1. Thus, the 2 Fundamentals of Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Photobiology 37 quantum yield of phosphorescence is small under such conditions. At low tem- peratures, in rigid matrices, however, the radiationless transitions may be slowed down to an extent that the phosphorescence quantum yield can become appre- ciable, too. The independence of photoluminescence spectra of the wavelength of absorp- tion, known as Kasha’s rule, is a consequence of the energy gap law making electronic energy relaxation by internal conversion fast until the S1 or T1 state is reached. Only here, further radiationless deactivation is slow enough for an emission process to compete. In principle, emission can also occur from a higher excited state, but the quantum yields of such processes are very low because of the dominance of radiationless deactivation processes. The exception of azulene has been mentioned above. The mirror image rule for the relation between ﬁrst absorption band and photoluminescence band is rationalized by the Franck– Condon principle. It predicts similar intensities for transitions between vibronic states with the same combination of vibrational quantum numbers, irrespective of whether the higher vibrational quantum number is associated with the ground state or the excited state (Fig. 2.12). Electronic energy transfer. For many situations in nature and technology, it is important that electronically excited states cannot only be produced by direct absorption of light, but also by accepting the electronic energy through a radia- tionless pathway from some other electronically excited species that has absorbed the light in the ﬁrst place. Examples of such processes can be found in photosyn- thesis and in bioanalytical applications (vide infra). The production of molecular singlet oxygen, a reactive key species in photodynamic therapy, is another case of particular interest for this book. Like the probability of the absorption of photons, the rates of electronic energy transfer processes are subject to speciﬁc rules. In the latter case, these are mainly concerned with the conservation of spin and the Fig. 2.12 Mirror-image relationship between absorption and emission exempliﬁed for the case of ﬂuorescence of anthracene.

For details cf. text 38 U. E. Steiner distance dependence of the energy transfer rate between the energy donor and the energy acceptor. It is in compliance with the spin conservation criterion that a donor in an excited singlet can transfer its energy to an acceptor in a singlet ground state, when the donor undergoes a transition to its singlet ground state and the acceptor ends up in an excited singlet state, usually in the S1 state. This type of energy transfer is termed singlet–singlet energy transfer, or—according to its most prominent mechanism—Förster resonance energy transfer. In practical applica- tions it also goes by the name of ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer. The acronym FRET allows for both readings. In case of triplet excited donors, the spin conservation principle allows only for the creation of triplet excited acceptor molecules, if their ground state is singlet. However, in the case of acceptors with a triplet ground state, spin-allowed energy transfer from triplet excited donors leads to excited singlet states. The case of molecular oxygen (cf. below) is a prominent example. Let us consider the FRET case ﬁrst (cf. Fig. 2.13). As described above, shortly after its photoexcitation, a donor is usually in its vibrationless ﬁrst excited singlet state, which has a typical lifetime of about 1 ns. A close-by acceptor mol- ecule can directly ‘‘sense’’ the electric ﬁeld of the transition dipole related to the electronic excitation of the donor and it can take up its energy if there is a reso- nance, i.e., an exact energy matching with an electronic transition in the acceptor. This process does not require the spontaneous emission of a photon by the donor but takes place in a radiationless fashion. The mechanism of the energy transfer is based on the dipole–dipole interaction between the transition dipole moments of donor and acceptor. The energy of the interaction between the two transition dipoles is proportional to the strength of the transition dipoles and to the inverse of the third power of the distance R between donor and acceptor. Since the rate of the energy transfer process is proportional to the square of the interaction energy, it depends on S0 S1 donor absorption acceptor emission donor acceptor Fig. 2.13 Principle of the FRET process. The concerted transitions of donor and acceptor require energy matching of ﬂuorescence of the donor (dashed green arrows and spectrum) and absorption of the acceptor (dashed orange arrows and spectrum). However, they occur without emission of the donor. After the energy transfer to the acceptor, its speciﬁc ﬂuorescence spectrum can be observed (red arrows, spectrum) 2 Fundamentals of Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Photobiology 39 the distance R as the inverse of the sixth power of R. This leads to the famous Förster relation for the rate constant kFRET of this type of energy transfer: kFRET ¼ k0 R0 R \u0002\u00036 ð2:12Þ Here k0 stands for the rate constant of spontaneous deactivation of the excited donor and R0 is the so-called Förster radius. At this separation of donor and acceptor, the rate constant of energy transfer and spontaneous decay of the excited donor are equal, i.e., under such conditions the overall decay rate of the donor is two times as fast as in the absence of an acceptor and the efﬁciency of energy transfer amounts to 50 %. The value of the Förster radius R0 is determined by the strength of the two interacting transition dipoles. As Förster has shown, the res- onance condition and the role of the strengths of the two transition dipoles can be exactly described by the overlap of the ﬂuorescence spectrum of the donor and the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. Nevertheless, the process does not involve spontaneous emission of a photon by the donor and its reabsorption by the acceptor. Donor and acceptor pairs with good interaction are characterized by high values of R0 which in favorable cases may reach values as high as 50–80 Å. In bioanalytical applications, FRET experiments, even with single molecule resolu- tion, have become a convenient tool to probe distances and conformational changes within complexes of biomacromolecules. If suitable donor and acceptor molecules are ﬁxed on conformationally mobile parts of a biomacromolecular complex their separation will undergo a dynamic change. Preferentially, the range of distances should comprise the Förster radius R0. In such a case, the efﬁciency of energy transfer will undergo appreciable changes which can be read from the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensities of donor and acceptor. Figure 2.14 shows a prominent recent example [15], where single molecule emission is used to probe the dynamics of the donor–acceptor distance and thereby the systematic motion of the rotating part of F0F1-ATPase of Esch- erichia coli. Using this technique, it can be demonstrated how the sense of the rotation changes with the environmental conditions under which ATP is synthe- sized or hydrolyzed, respectively. Triplet–triplet energy transfer. Since excited triplet states live much longer than excited singlets, the chance that they can transfer energy before they decay is higher, or can be effected with the same efﬁciency at lower concentrations of the acceptor species. As with singlet–singlet energy transfer, there is also conservation of the overall spin in triplet–triplet energy transfer processes. Whereas, however, there is spin conservation in each of the partners of a singlet–singlet energy transfer, there is spin conversion from triplet to singlet in the donor and singlet to triplet in the acceptor. Therefore, this process is not induced by the coupling of two transition dipole moments, which are very weak for spin-forbidden transitions, and it does not have a long-range character as in the Förster mechanism. Efﬁcient triplet–triplet energy transfer is made possible by the synchronous exchange of two electrons related to the two singly occupied orbitals in each of the two species 40 U. E. Steiner involved in the process. This principle is depicted in Fig. 2.15. The so-called exchange mechanism was ﬁrst suggested by Dexter. It requires some spatial overlap of the electronic wavefunctions of the two species which can be only achieved if the two molecules get into close contact.

Here, thioxanthone is the triplet energy donor and naphthalene the acceptor. Since, at room temperature, phosphorescence is usually too weak, an observation by transient absorption is the standard method of detection for triplets at ambient temperatures. As with singlet–singlet energy transfer, a matching of energies of donor and acceptor triplets is a condition for an efﬁcient process in the case of triplet–triplet energy transfer, too. As in the former case, electronic energy transfer also comprises the excitation of vibrations (cf. Fig. 2.13) the probability of which is controlled by the Franck–Condon principle (cf. the special example of singlet oxygen formation below). Since the donor usually ends up in some vib- rationally excited ground state and the acceptor in a vibrational excited triplet state, the best conditions for energy matching are given if the purely electronic energy of the donor is higher than that of the acceptor, i.e., ET(D) [ ET(A). Singlet oxygen formation by electronic energy transfer [5]. In photodynamic therapy, singlet excited molecular oxygen plays a central role. Figure 2.17 shows the electron conﬁgurations related to the lowest electronic states of molecular oxygen. They differ in the populations of the lowest p* orbitals. These orbitals represent the antibonding combinations of the atomic p-orbitals having their axis perpendicular to the molecular axis. In Fig. 2.17, the representations of two real- valued orbitals termed LUMO a and LUMO b are shown. The orbitals LUMO a and LUMO b represent wave functions with an orbital angular momentum of quantum number 1. But the sense of the electron rotation around the molecular axis, i.e., whether it is a right-hand or left-hand turn, is not deﬁned for these orbitals. Instead, they represent situations where right and left sense rotation are equally mixed. The p orbitals p±1* are obtained from them as symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations but with the imaginary number \u0006i as a phase factor. The complex orbitals p+1* and p-1* represent states with sharply deﬁned 01 2 3 4 5 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7ΔA time, µs 01 2 3 45 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5ΔA time, µs S O3 3 Fig. 2.16 Experimental example of triplet–triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone triplet (donor) and naphthalene (acceptor).

Left: transient absorption of thioxanthone triplet for (from above) concentrations 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 mM of naphthalene.

In an isolated O2 molecule, these states are exactly degenerate for symmetry reasons. In the lowest electronic state of O2, i.e., in its ground state, each of the two p* orbitals is singly occupied and the spins of the two unpaired electrons are parallel, according to Hund’s rule. Hence the ground state of O2 is a triplet state and therefore paramagnetic. Since the orbital angular momenta of p\u0005 þ1 and p \u0005 \u00021 are equal, but opposite in sign, they cancel each other, so that the total orbital angular momentum is zero. This fact is expressed by the term symbol R. If both electrons share the same p*orbital, their spins must be opposite, such that the total spin is zero. On the other hand, their orbital angular momenta add up to a quantum number of 2 for the total orbital angular momentum. These properties are denoted by the term symbol 1D. Finally, if the two electrons are in different p* orbitals, but with opposite spins we generate a singlet state with total orbital angular momentum quantum number 0, i.e., a 1R state. One should note that the single conﬁgurations shown in Fig. 2.17 for 1R and 1D do not give the full representation of the wave functions of the two states. The full wave functions include the complementary conﬁgurations, too, where the populations of the two p* orbitals are just exchanged. The energies of the two lowest excited states of O2 are 94 kJ/ mol (1D) and 157 kJ/mol ( 1R) above the 3R ground state. The energy differences are due to the differences in electron–electron repulsion reﬂecting the different average distances between the two electrons for the different conﬁgurations. Singlet-excited oxygen can be produced by energy transfer from donors in excited singlet or triplet states. In case of excited singlet state donors, spin conservation requires that these undergo a transition from the excited singlet to the lowest excited triplet state. For energy reasons, the singlet/triplet gap must be greater than about 90 kJ/mol in order to populate the lowest excited singlet of oxygen. Furthermore, a diffusive encounter between molecular oxygen and the donor has to occur within a few nanoseconds, due to the short lifetime of the excited donor singlet. These con- ditions are not easy to fulﬁll in an effective way. Therefore, excited triplets as energy donors are the usual method to generate singlet excited molecular oxygen. In Fig. 2.18, a scheme for the population and depopulation of excited states of molecular oxygen is shown. On encounter of the triplet donor and the triplet ground state oxygen molecule, the total spin of the pair can be 0, 1, or 2, LUMO a LUMO b * 1π+ * 1π− * 1π+ * 1π− * 1π+ * 1π− 1Σ 1Δ 3Σ Fig. 2.17 Orbital conﬁgurations of the lowest electronic states of molecular oxygen. The states differ in the two-electron conﬁguration of the degenerate two p* orbitals. For details cf. text 2 Fundamentals of Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Photobiology 43 corresponding to an overall singlet, triplet or quintet state, respectively. The sta- tistical weights of these states are 1/9, 1/3, and 5/9, respectively. A deactivation of the encounter complex to a state comprising the singlet ground state of the donor and a singlet-excited oxygen species is only possible from the encounter complex with singlet multiplicity. However, there is rapid equilibrium between the encounter complexes in their different multiplicities [16], so that eventually all excited donor triplets may lead to the formation of singlet-excited oxygen, if the triplet lifetime is long enough. The ratio at which the two different singlet states of oxygen are formed is governed by the energy gap law (vide supra) [5]. In the encounter complex, the radiationless transition rate from the energy level of the excited donor to that of a speciﬁc excited state of oxygen is at a maximum for energy gaps between 0 and about 80 kJ/mol. For larger energy gaps, the rate quickly decreases. Thus, e.g., for 9-bromoanthracene, a triplet sensitizer with a triplet energy of 168 kJ/mol, the energy gap to both, the 1R and the 1D state of oxygen is within the range of maximum rate and they are both populated with about 50 % probability [17]. On the other hand, for 2-acetonaphtone with a triplet energy of 248 kJ/mol, the energy gap to 1R is 154 kJ/mol, i.e., in the region where the rate is strongly decreasing, but for the population of 1D with an energy gap of 91 kJ/mol the rate is still close to the maximum. This situation explains why, with this triplet energy donor, the 1R and the 1D state of oxygen are formed at a ratio of 17:83 [17]. For most practical purposes, however, it is important to note that in condensed phases the radiationless deactivation of O2( 1R)toO2(1D) takes place on the nanosecond time scale and it is unimportant whether O2(1D) is formed directly in the encounter of triplet excited donor and ground state oxygen or through the 1R state. It must be added, though, that in cases of donors with low oxidation potential, the encounter complexes of triplet donor and singlet ground state molecular oxygen may be deactivated through the intermediacy of a charge Fig. 2.18 Level scheme of lowest electronic states of molecular oxygen. Radiationless deactivation processes require interaction with surrounding molecules taking up the vibrational energy 44 U. E. Steiner transfer state, wherefrom the population efﬁciency of the two excited singlet states of oxygen is lower than in the previous mechanism [18]. In condensed media, the lifetimes of the two singlet-excited oxygen species differ by about six orders of magnitude [5]. They are determined by radiationless transfer of electronic energy to vibrational energy of the surrounding medium which can occur directly or, with higher rate, in the presence of charge transfer interaction. Particularly long lifetimes are observed in perhalogenated solvents such as CCl4 with lifetimes of 130 ns for O2(1R) and 31 ms for O2(1D). Particu- larly short lifetimes are observed in solvents with OH-vibrations, such as H2O with a lifetime of 3.8 ls for O2(1D). That this behavior is due to the speciﬁc frequency of OH-vibrations, can be concluded from a much longer lifetime of 62 lsinD2O. In photodynamic therapy, the lifetime of singlet oxygen determines the average length d the excited oxygen molecule can diffuse away from the point where it was created. According to Einstein’s square law d2 ¼ 6Ds ð2:13Þ where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient and s the lifetime of the diffusing species. In living cells, the value of D for molecular oxygen is about 1.4 9 10-5 cm2s-1 and the lifetime of O2(1D) 0.04 ls. Hence the diffusion length under such conditions amounts to about 20 nm [5]. 2.2 Photochemistry and Photobiology Photochemistry, in a modern sense, is the area dealing with chemical processes in electronically excited states [6–11]. Since such states are normally generated by the absorption of light, it is clear that only absorbed but not transmitted light can cause photoinduced chemical change. This principle was ﬁrst stated as the Grotthus- Draper law. Because light is absorbed in units of photons, each molecule under- going a photoreaction has to absorb a photon.1 However, since electronically excited states may relax to the ground state by dissipating their excess energy either in radiative or radiationless processes, the probability that a molecule undergoes a chemical transformation after absorption of a photon is generally not unity. This probability is called the photochemical quantum yield of the photochemical process under consideration. The inverse of this quantity is the number of photons a mol- ecule has to absorb on the average before it will undergo a photoreaction. Just as normal thermal reactions, photoreactions, too, are characterized by certain changes of nuclear coordinates. The electronic energy as a function of the nuclear coordinates may be viewed as spanning a hypersurface of potential energy on which the nuclear system undergoes periodic vibrational motion and, in some 1 This does not apply to radical chain reactions, where one absorbed photon may result in many product molecules. 2 Fundamentals of Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Photobiology 45 cases, nonperiodic translocations, the latter representing chemical change and the path of lowest energy between the minima the reaction coordinate. Whereas, however, in a normal thermal reaction, the system never leaves the potential surface of the ground state, in a photoreaction, there is necessarily a cross-over from a higher potential surface to that of the ground state (diabatic change) where every reaction eventually must end. According to Förster [19], photoreactions may be classiﬁed according to the three cases depicted in Fig. 2.19. They are distin- guished from each other by the way the system undergoes its transition to the ground state potential surface. In case (a), the chemical change is completely achieved in the excited state. Only after vibrational relaxation in the excited photoproduct the system undergoes a radiationless decay to the ground state. Such photoreactions are called adiabatic, because the potential energy hypersurfaces, representing the change of the total energy of the system under adiabatically slow motions of the nuclei, are also called adiabatic energy surfaces. Proton transfer reactions in the excited state represent the most prominent type of such adiabatic reactions. In case (b), a radiationless cross-over from the higher to the lower potential surface takes place before the conﬁguration of a stable product is reached in the excited state. Such situations may occur, if potential minima on the excited energy hypersurface are situated between minima of the ground state hypersurface. Photochemical cis/trans-isomerizations provide examples of such reactions. Finally, in case (c), the chemical change occurs in the electronic ground state after radiationless deactivation of the excited state and with the aid of the vibrational excess energy, i.e., from a ‘‘hot’’ ground state, before this vibrational energy is dissipated to the environment. Another important classiﬁcation of photoreactions refers to their molecularity, i.e., whether they are intramolecular (monomolecular) of intermolecular (bimo- lecular). In the second case, the reaction partner of an excited molecule is usually a ground-state molecule. For such bimolecular reactions, the probability of a pho- toreaction, i.e., its photochemical quantum yield, depends on the concentration of the unexcited reaction partner. energy reaction coordinate (a) (b) (c) Fig. 2.19 Three cases of photochemical reactions according to Förster’s classiﬁcation [19]: a adiabatic photoreaction, b diabatic photoreaction, c hot ground state reaction.

The concentration [Q]1/2 at which half of the limiting quantum yield is attained, is determined by the rate constants kq and k0: Q½\u00071=2¼ k0 kq ð2:15Þ After these general introductory remarks we will now regard some represen- tative examples of elementary photochemical reactions. 2.2.1 Photoelectron Transfer Reactions Photoexcitation caused by the absorption of light may be viewed as the separation of electron pairs, whereby one of the previously paired electrons is lifted up in energy into an empty orbital and a positive hole is left in the orbital where the electron came from. In this sense, the excitation is tantamount to an intramolecular charge separation. This is a rather formal view, however, since the involved orbitals normally penetrate each other strongly, such that the centers of gravity of the two orbitals may even coincide and no dipole moment results. Electron and hole can quickly recombine, a process denoted above as radiationless deactivation, and release the absorbed energy as heat to the environment. However, further spatial separation of (excited) electron and hole, as occurring by an electron transfer or hole transfer to a neighboring molecule and still further on, may occur with little loss of energy, but prevents rapid recombination of hole and electron. Thus, photo electron transfer reactions represent an ideal means of conserving light energy as chemical energy on longer time scales. This principle lies at the heart of natural processes such as photosynthesis and technical processes as used in photovoltaics (cf. Fig. 2.20).

The symbol F represents Faraday’s constant. The more positive the value of E\u0002\u0002 (A-/A), the stronger A acts as an oxidant. Likewise, the more negative the value of E\u0002\u0002 (D/D +), the stronger D acts as a reductant. For organic molecules, these potentials are usually not strong enough to oxidize or reduce some other organic species. As shown in Fig. 2.21, the situation is, how- ever, drastically changed, if A or D are electronically excited. If the donor reacts from an excited state, the Gibbs free energy becomes more negative by the amount of the excitation energy of the donor: DG\u0002o et ¼ F \u0003 EoðD=DþÞ\u0002 EoðA\u0002=AÞðÞ \u0002 E\u0005 D ð2:18Þ Thus in an excited state a molecule is a stronger electron donor, i.e., a better reductant than in its ground state.

E. Steiner Due to these relations, photoinduced electron transfer reactions are quite fre- quent phenomena and, in many cases, these reactions are quite fast. This brings us to the question of how the rate of an electron transfer reaction and its thermo- dynamic driving force are related. It has been shown, both theoretically and experimentally that, other factors, such as the overlap of the electronic wave- functions, determined by the separation between donor and acceptor, being equal, there is a strong correlation between the rate of electron transfer and the Gibbs free energy change of the process [4]. In Fig. 2.22, essential results are illustrated. In theoretical respect, the Marcus theory represented a great breakthrough [21–23]. Its main idea focuses on the change of the nuclear coordinates induced by the electron transfer and introduces the parameter k, the so-called reorganization energy, corresponding to the change of electronic energy that would ensue if the system would adopt the nuclear conﬁguration of the product but would remain in the initial electronic state present before the electron transfer. If -DGet is smaller than k the electron transfer needs activation energy and the reaction gets faster the more negative DGet. This is called the normal Marcus regime. If -DGet exceeds the value of k the reaction is activationless and exergonic. The excess energy has to be converted to vibrational energy which is the same situation that led to the energy gap law of radiationless transitions, i.e., the rate decreases as DGet tends to more and more negative values. This regime is called the inverted Marcus regime. In a brilliant series of experiments by Closs and coworkers this prediction of the Marcus theory was demonstrated to be correct [20]. The most important case of a photoinduced electron transfer reaction in nature is represented by the primary process of photosynthesis.

Today, the structure of such reaction centers in photosynthetic bacteria as well as in plants is known to a high atomic resolution [25]. Figure 2.23 shows the active molecules and processes involved in a bacterial reaction center. After excitation of the special pair, occurring mainly through singlet–singlet energy transfer from accessory antenna pigments, a photoelectron transfer to the ﬁrst electron acceptor, a close-by bacteriochlorophyll molecule occurs within about 3 ps which is followed by an even faster hop-on process of the transferred electron to a pheophytin molecule. From here, the electron is transferred to an ubiquinone molecule, a process occurring in about 200 ps. Finally, with the intermediacy of a ferredoxin molecule, the ubiquinone in the second branch accepts the photoelectron, a process occurring on the time scale of about 10 ls. In purple bacteria, the electron returns from the ﬁnal quinone acceptor to the oxidized special pair within about 1 s, thus completing an electron transfer cycle.

(2.18) and (2.19) by a term accounting for the different Coulomb energies of the donor/acceptor pair before and after the electron transfer. In polar environments, however, this term is usually small.) according to R. Marcus. In the ‘‘normal’’ region the electron transfer reaction needs to be activated, in the ‘‘inverted’’ region, the transformation of electronic excess energy into vibrational degrees of freedom is rate determining. The reorganization energy parameter k determines the transition region.

E. Steiner energetic beneﬁt of the bacteria results from a proton and electric potential gra- dient that is generated between the two sides of the photosynthetic membrane, because the electron transport is accompanied by a proton transport from the periplasm to the cytoplasm. Protons ﬂowing back along the gradient through the channel of membrane spanning ATPase can drive chemical energy storage through phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (cf. Fig. 2.14). In plants, there are two types of photosynthetic reaction centers. The photoelectron transfer chain from reaction center I leads to the reduction of the NADP+. The oxidized special pair in reaction center I is reduced at the end of the photoelectron transfer chain from reaction center II, which in turn recovers its electron by the oxidation of water, mediated by a close-by manganese complex and leading to the generation of molecular oxygen. 2.2.2 Excited State Proton Transfer Reactions Electronically excited states behave differently from the ground state because the distribution of electron density over the atoms in a molecule is changed. As was shown in the last section, this goes along with a change in the effective redox- potential, leading to stronger oxidation and reduction power. Likewise, the ability Fig. 2.23 Structure and primary photoelectron transfer pathways in bacterial reaction centers. Like in plants, these reaction centers consist of two almost symmetric branches comprising two bacteriochlorophyll molecules DM and DL, interacting directly with each other and representing the ‘‘special pair’’ D, two bacteriochlorophylls BA and BB, two bacteriopheophytins UA and UB and two quinones QA and QB. Only the right-hand side branch is active in the electron transfer process. Reprinted from http://metallo.scripps.edu/promise/PRCPB.html (cf. Ref. [24]) with permission by K. N. Degtyarenko 2 Fundamentals of Photophysics, Photochemistry, and Photobiology 51 to accept or donate protons is changed upon electronic excitation. This effect can be measured by the change of the acid dissociation constant Ka, usually expressed by the pKa value: pKa ¼\u0002 log Ka ð2:20Þ For excited states, the pKa is usually denoted with an asterisk, i.e., as pKa*. As an example, the case of 2-naphthol is shown in Fig. 2.24. In a diagram repre- senting the fractions of undissociated (acid) and dissociated (basic) form as a function of pH, the pKa value can be read from the point where both forms are present in equal amounts. In the ground state, 2-naphthol exhibits a pKa of 9.2, i.e., it is a rather weak acid. In the ﬁrst excited singlet state the pKa* jumps up to a value of 2, i.e., the compound turns to a fairly strong acid. The reason for this, is a shift of electron density away from the oxygen atom to the aromatic ring system when an electron is excited from the LUMO to the HOMO. Proteolytic processes in the excited singlet state can be easily monitored by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy. If a molecule is excited, for example at a pH where the acidic form prevails in the ground state, but the ﬂuorescence observed is speciﬁc to the basic form, this means that a deprotonation of the excited acidic form must have taken place during its excited state lifetime. Furthermore, this is evidence of the fact that the system remains on the excited state potential surface during the reaction and thus represents an example of an adiabatic photoreaction. In Fig. 2.25, the situation is illustrated for 2-naphthol. The position of the equilibrium between the acidic (neutral, protonated) and the basic (anionic, deprotonated) form at a particular pH can be judged from the absorption spectra. At pH values greater than 8, changes toward the shape of the ﬁnal spectrum associated with the basic form become clearly visible. (cf. left-hand side of Fig. 2.25).

Steiner nanoseconds after a short excitation pulse at a pH of 6.6. At this pH, the molecule in its ground state equilibrium is still completely undissociated. Immediately after excitation, the ﬂuorescence spectrum corresponds to the mirror image of the absorption band of the acidic form, but then it is gradually converted to a band at longer wavelength, characteristic of the 2-naphtholate anion. This observation reﬂects the time scale of the deprotonation process. The ﬂuorescence observations accompanying proteolytic equilibria in the excited state were ﬁrst explained by Förster, who suggested the spectroscopic/ thermodynamic cycle, the so-called Förster cycle, represented in Fig. 2.26. From the cycle and the principle of conservation of energy, spectroscopic and thermo- dynamic energies can be combined and lead to the following relation: pK\u0005 a \u0002 pKa ¼ EA\u0002 \u0002 EHA 2:3 RT ð2:21Þ It allows to estimate the pKa* value from the spectroscopic energies EA\u0002 and EAH of the basic and the acidic form, respectively. These energies can be taken either from the absorption spectra or from the ﬂuorescence spectra. As follows qualitatively from Eq. (2.21), the excited state is more acidic (has a lower pKa* value) than the ground state, if the absorption (or the emission) of the basic form is at lower energy (longer wavelength) than of the acidic form. This is usually the case for neutral acids (cf. the naphthol case shown in Fig. 2.25). The opposite is generally true if the basic from is neutral, e.g., in aromatic amines. Excited state proton transfer reactions can be also found in natural systems.

The ﬂuorescent chromophore is shown in Fig. 2.27. In the ground state, the phenolic OH group is undissociated, although part of a hydrogen bonded network of various amino acids. On excitation, a proton transfer takes place along this network and the emission arising is characteristic of the anionic, i.e., depro- tonated chromophore. 2.2.3 Photochemical Cis/Trans-Isomerizations Whereas, internal molecular rotations around single bonds between carbon and heteroatoms are fairly and easily achieved, internal rotations around double bonds are hindered by high activation barriers. Such barriers arise from the decreasing overlap of the vicinal pp-orbitals as the p-plane of the neighboring centers adopts a perpendicular conﬁguration. In Fig. 2.27, the energetic effect of such a rotation on the energy of the p-molecular orbitals is schematically shown for the case of ethylene. During the rotation, the energies of HOMO and LUMO approach each other. At 90o, i.e., in the perpendicular conﬁguration, both orbitals become HO N N O N H R1 OHN H R2 O O -O N N O N H R1 OHN H R2 O O neutral form anionic form Fig. 2.27 Fluorescent chromophore of the green ﬂuorescent protein.

Continuing the rotation to 180o HOMO and LUMO are interchanged as compared to the situation at the beginning. Thus, considering the state energy of the electronic conﬁgurations with both p-electrons in the HOMO, the ground state, would be raised up to the energy of S2 (in that simple picture) after rotation by 180o. The ﬁrst excited singlet, corresponding to an electron conﬁguration with one electron in the HOMO and one in the LUMO, would keep its energy unchanged on such a rotation, and the S2 state, with both electrons in the LUMO in the beginning, would end up as S0 after a 180o rotation. Although this description is rather simpliﬁed, it conveys the essential concept and demonstrates the electronic origin of the potential curves in the ground and excited states. A representation of the S1 and S2 potential surfaces of stilbene versus two relevant coordinates as calculated by a full ab initio quantum chemical calculation is also shown in Fig. 2.28. From it, the dynamics of a molecule after excitation to the excited state may be anticipated. After exciting the molecule in its trans- conformation (/ = 180o) it ﬁnds itself on a very ﬂat surface and will eventually proceed toward the perpendicular (/ = 90o) conformation where the potential surface exhibits a minimum. Upon radiationless deactivation to the lower potential surface of the ground state, the molecule will end up on a potential hill and may proceed further to the right or to the left, i.e., toward the cis-conformation or back Fig. 2.28 Left, top: effect of of C–C bond rotation angle / on p orbitals and energy scheme of ethylene.

Experimentally, it is indeed found that the quantum yields from trans to cis or from cis to trans are both on the order of 50 % [29]. It must be mentioned, though, that the real mechanism of this photoreaction may be much more complex and may involve the potential surface of the excited triplet state, too, as well as distortions of additional motional degrees of freedom such as the pyramidal distortion indicated in Fig. 2.28 as points of transition between different potential surfaces. Whereas, for C=C double bonds, rotation around the bond is the only way to achieve the cis/trans-isomerization, there are other options in the case of double bonds involving heteroatoms. A much studied system is azobenzene which is used as a chemical actinometer and is a very prominent candidate in modern research about molecular devices. Here the photoisomerization process implies a rehy- bridization at one of the nitrogen atoms with an intermediate linearization of the N=N–C angle [30, 31] (Fig. 2.29). In nature, cis/trans-photoisomerization provides the mechanism of two important biological functions. The ﬁrst is the process of vision where the key chromophore is the polyene retinal, chemically bound through a azomethine function (Schiff base) to the protein opsin to form the rhodopsin unit, which is to be found in the light sensitive cells of the retina [32]. In the dark, the retinylidene group is in an 11-cis conﬁguration (cf. Fig. 2.30). It isomerizes to the all-trans form upon light excitation. This process triggers a sequence of events during which the retinal is released and new rhodopsin is generated by the binding of fresh 11-cis retinal to the opsin. The cis/trans-photoisomerization of rhodopsin serves another important func- tion in photosynthetic archaea as halobacterium halobium, a single-celled microorganism that stands extreme habitats such as hot springs and salt lakes. Here the dark state of the retinylidene moiety is all-trans (cf. Fig. 2.30) and undergoes a trans to cis photoisomerization of the double bond at position 13 upon which a proton at the azomethine nitrogen atom is released. Again, this process is part of a cycle, which, in this case, however, does not elicit a nerve signal but serves to pump protons across the cell membrane, so that a proton gradient between inner and outer space of the membrane is created [33]. Thus, the light energy is trans- formed to osmotic energy and later to chemical energy via the transformation of ADP to ATP. NN Fig. 2.29 Photoisomerization pathway of azobenzene 56 U. E.

Steiner Chapter 3 Molecular Biological Mechanisms in Photodynamic Therapy Barbara Krammer and Thomas Verwanger Abstract Cellular and molecular photodamage mechanisms are initiated by light- activation of a photosensitizer following its accumulation in cellular targets. While lethal doses of photodynamic therapy (PDT) eliminate vessels and cells, sublethal effects occur, e.g., during ﬂuorescence diagnosis (FD). Accordingly, the events subsequent photoactivation lead to different cellular endpoints being primarily growth stimulation, damage repair, autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis. Activation of survival pathways seems to be not only involved in growth stimulation, but also in PDT damage transmission. Sublethal PDT results from activation of cellular damage protection and adaptive mechanisms, and can modulate signaling path- ways and immune reactions. Autophagy may serve to rescue cells or lead to cell death under special conditions. Lethal PDT activates stress response, e.g., via mitochondria or ER, inducing apoptosis. If the damage is too severe, the cellular energy level low or the plasma membrane leaky, cells will die by necrosis.

This is achieved via a so-called photo- sensitizer which is activated by visible light with a wavelength matching its absorption maxima: The subsequent photosensitizer deactivation occurs either via ﬂuorescence, which is used for target detection, or via chemical reactions in its triplet state. In the presence of oxygen, the chemical reactions are induced by electron or energy transfer, by which reactive oxygen (ROS) or nitrogen species (RNS) are formed. Since photosensitizers generally selectively accumulate in (pre)malignant tissues, in contrast to normal tissues, and in some other targets like bacteria, FD, and PDT can be used for tumor treatment or, e.g., disinfection. Most of the photosensitizers for PDT are porphyrin-based or naturally occurring such as 60 B. Krammer and T. Verwanger hypericin, a constituent of the St. John’s wort; many of them are currently tested and several of those are already approved and clinically used [2]. The present review shall give an overview on some molecular biological effects of PDT in tumor tissues and cells. The efﬁciency of PDT depends on the type of photosensitizer, drug concen- tration, and intracellular localization, incubation time, irradiation parameters (ﬂuence, power density, and wavelength), oxygen availability, and the suscepti- bility of the target including antioxidant defense mechanisms. The sequence of steps leading to tissue damage will be described in the following. 3.2 Development of Intracellular Damage After application of a photosensitizer or a prodrug to the patient by several routes such as intravenous or topical, the substance reaches the target tissue directly or via blood transportation, accumulating in vessels and/or tumor cells and/or extracellular matrix (ECM). In cases where the prodrug aminolevulinic acid (ALA)—a natural precursor of the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the heme syn- thesis—is applied in excess, PpIX is accumulated in mitochondria and serves as an endogenous photosensitizer. Uptake to cells occurs by various active or passive mechanisms depending on the type of the used photosensitizer. In the time interval between photosensitizer accumulation and irradiation a relocalization of the photosensitizer to other subcellular targets or even efﬂux from the cell may occur. Positioned irradiation of the photosensitizer by lasers, lamps, or LEDs activates the substance. In the presence of molecular oxygen, especially singlet oxygen, other ROS and additionally RNS are locally formed; the latter mainly in the vascular response [3, 4]. Depending not only on the localization of the photosensitizer and on the amount of generated reactive species, but also on general and immediate antioxidant defense mechanisms of the cell, the extent of the primary cell damage originates from oxidation of the molecules located at or very close to the damage site within the diffusion range of the reactive species. Proteins and lipids are oxidized; DNA only, if it is located next to the nuclear membrane, since most clinically applied photosensitizers enter the nucleus, if at all, to a minor degree [5]. This may account for the absence of major mutagenic effects of PDT. Induction of minimal damage is obviously tolerated by the cells or may even lead to growth stimulation by some photosensitizers. Once protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation and their consequences cannot be prevented or repaired by, e.g., vitamin E supply, upregulation of protective genes [6], or hypoxia-induced resistance to PDT in the case of vessels [7], damage development continues until an irreversible endpoint is reached. Amount and kind of damage development again are inﬂuenced by cell physiological parameters, be it the amount of [Ca 2+]i [8], genetic/molecular response, and onset of signaling pathways [6] or the interaction with the cell environment such as the ECM. At the level of organelle photodamage, the cells could still survive by the rescue 3 Molecular Biological Mechanisms in Photodynamic Therapy 61 mechanism of autophagy by which the damaged targets are engulfed intracellu- larly in autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes in order to eliminate the ‘‘garbage’’. This seems to occur after PDT with ER- and mitochondria-localizing photosensitizers such as hypericin in apoptosis-competent cells. In contrast, photodamage to lysosomes may lead to the abortion of an autophagic response [9]. If cells and vessels are not rescued by autophagy, the target tissue is eliminated. Damage to vessels may lead to a vascular shut-down, blood ﬂow stasis, and hypoxia [10]; often accompanied by nitric oxide production [3] or hypoxia- induced gene expression [6] like that of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [11]. Damage to the ECM has an impact on, e.g., collagens and matrix metallo- proteases [12]. Lethal damage to tumor cells can be classiﬁed into several ‘‘deadly’’ endpoints ranging from autophagy to necrosis. The endpoints of cellular damage development will be described subsequently under molecular aspects. 3.3 Molecular Mechanisms in Sublethal Damage Processing Sublethal PDT is the result of low-dose conditions, which are, e.g., present during FD, used for stimulation of anticancer immune responses [13, 14] or which are inevitable in deeper tissue layers, which receive less irradiation and/or lower photosensitizer concentrations than the surface. At the transition between ‘‘no effect’’ and damage, harmless or even stimulating PDT may be applied, which indeed counteracts tumor eradication, but would be advantageous for, e.g. wound healing. A stimulatory effect on cell growth found after hypericin-PDT on human tumor cells [15] or after aluminum phthalocyanine-mediated-PDT on osteoblastic cells [16] has been observed in a few cases only. In the case of hypericin-PDT, it can be suggested that the known stimulation of the survival pathways of p38MAPK and JNK is responsible for the growth promotion [17]. Also the activated transcription factor NF-kappa B mediates therapy resistance and growth stimulation. After PDT of glioblastoma cells, inhibition of NF-kappa B could improve the therapeutic effect [18]. By increasing the PDT dose, the cells activate rescue mechanisms ranging from immediate response to scavenge ROS and RNS by, e.g., reduced glutathione or superoxide dismutase to long-lasting strategies to neutralize oxidized products and eliminate their consequences. The mechanisms include, e.g., the use of vitamins or the induction or upregulation of gene and protein expression, which assist in cell- speciﬁc [6] or more general repair and adaptive strategies. This includes, e.g., induction/upregulation of VEGF [19], HO-1 [20], JNK1, p38MAPK , and PI3K, while irreversibly inhibiting ERK2 [20, 21], p38MAPK-mediated COX-2 [22] and Bcl-2 phosphorylation [23]. 62 B. Krammer and T. Verwanger Autophagy of damaged organelles is the ﬁnal rescue mechanism to protect the cells from death. The process can be initiated by those light-activated photosen- sitizers, which are localizing in ER, mitochondria, and partly in lysosomes. Autophagy may occur independently of apoptosis; in the case of defective apop- totic pathways it may lead to cell death, as it will be described below. The current state of knowledge is reviewed in detail by Reiners et al. [9]. 3.4 Molecular Mechanisms in Lethal Damage Processing Whether photodamage is lethal will be determined not only by the PDT protocol and the above-described protection mechanisms, but also by the cellular physi- ology and the inﬂuence of cellular environment as the ECM in tissue. It can be hypothesized that signaling pathways for induction of cell death and survival are active in parallel in the same cell, until the cell has to make a decision on the basis of the summary of all information available. In the case of hypericin-PDT on A431 cells, e.g., the strongly upregulated MAPK phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) could have the function of the switch between survival and apoptosis [6]. Autophagic cell death is ‘‘switched on’’, when the apoptotic pathway is blocked, as found in Bax/Bak knock-out mice with mTOR and PI3K/AKT playing a role in the autophagic pathway [9, 24]. A decision between apoptosis and necrosis is based inter alia on intracellular energy supply, since apoptosis as an energy-consuming process is dependent on ATP or alternative energy sources [25]. Necrosis induction is also promoted by leakiness of the cellular membrane, which is likely to be caused by photosensitizer localization in this target. If photosensitizer localization (e.g., in mitochondria), the extent of damage and some special events like loss of BCL-2 favor apoptosis induction, the latter may be executed by mainly two ways. The mitochondrial pathway is triggered at the mitochondria either directly [25] or via the ER stress pathway. In the case of direct induction, it is likely that the adenine nucleotide translocator ANT is oxidized by ROS, the mitochondrial membrane potential is decreased and the mitochondrial permeability transition pores are opened. Subsequently, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, forming an apoptosome with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1) and procaspase 9. By this, active procaspase 9 is provided, which subsequently activates the executing caspases 3 and 6, as shown with squamous cell carcinoma cells [25, 26]. Also loss of BCL-2 and lysosomal damage can lead to apoptosis induction. While in most cases, when apoptosis is executed via the mitochondrial path- way, cytochrome c release and caspase 9, 3, 6, and 7 activation lead to cell decomposition, also the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) may generate DNA and cell fragmentation in a caspase-independent manner [27]. In addition, the receptor- mediated pathway may be induced via an external signal or by an internal feed- back loop, occasionally by ROS-dependent FAS- aggregation, activating FAS receptor, adaptor protein, and caspase 8. The latter may lead to activation of the 3 Molecular Biological Mechanisms in Photodynamic Therapy 63 caspases 3, 6, and 7 directly or via the mitochondrial pathway, mediated by the proapoptotic Bcl-2 member Bid. Also some particular events are described such as a release of the mitochondria- bound hexokinase mHK, mediated by a pH drop following hypericin-PDT [28]. The expression of many genes and proteins was found to be altered following apoptosis-inducing PDT, depending on the cell line, treatment protocol, and time after treatment. Upregulation of c-jun and c-fos, both together forming the tran- scription factor AP-1, was detected in several studies. In addition, treatment of human squamous cell carcinoma cells with hypericin-PDT resulted 1.5–8 h later in up- and down-regulation of genes concerning apoptosis, cytoskeleton, and cell attachment, oxidative stress, proliferation and cell cycle, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, protein transport, energy metabolism, and some more [6]. The molecular mechanisms of PDT-induced apoptosis using hypericin are furthermore presented in detail in a review of Buytaert et al. [29]. The authors describe the induction of apoptosis via the ER stress pathway, which leads to apoptosis or may alternatively result in autophagy, when cells are apoptosis-incompetent, as men- tioned above. The ER stress pathway is favored, if the photosensitizer is located in the ER, as it applies to hypericin. In this case, irradiation leads to an immediate sarco/ endoplasmic Ca2+ -ATPase-2 (SERCA2) pump photodamage, to ER Ca2+ deple- tion and to disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, which induces apoptosis via Bax and Bak or autophagy, when Bax and Bak are not available [30]. In addition, the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Expression proﬁling 7 h after hypericin-PDT of bladder cancer cells conﬁrmed differential changes in ER stress response and UPR, autophagy, pro- liferation, inﬂammation, and antioxidant defense [29]. Autophagy is stimulated by various stress signals such as oxidative stress and may be induced or prevented by destruction of lysosomes. As mentioned above, autophagic processes lead to cell death, when apoptosis is induced, but cannot be executed if the proapoptotic Bax and Bak proteins are absent [9]. mTOR and PI3 K/AKT seem to play a role in the autophagic pathway [9, 24]. Also mitotic cell death was observed following hypericin-PDT, which is sug- gested to be generated by hypericin-enhanced ubiquitinylation of the heat-shock protein 90 [31]. If the damage is too severe, the cellular energy level low or the cytoplasmic membrane leaky, cells will die by necrosis. References 1.

Verwanger Part III Methods and Instrumentation Chapter 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT Rudolf Steiner Abstract The diagnosis of tissue alterations by ﬂuorescence spectroscopy or different modalities of ﬂuorescence imaging is widely used to detect precancerous or cancerous lesions. Demarcation of such lesions supports the efﬁcient treatment either by photodynamic therapy (PDT) or conventional surgical intervention. Autoﬂuorescence of tissue intrinsic chromophores like ﬂavines, Nicotinamide- Adenine-Dinucleotide-Hydrogen (NADH), collagens or porphyrins excited by UV or blue light and change of the concentrations of the ﬂuorescent compounds is an indication of tissue alterations. More speciﬁc is the use of ﬂuorescent sensitizers enriched in target cells after local or systemic application. Meanwhile, sensitizers of the third generation are developed or coupled to nanoparticles as carriers. For application of the optimum light dose in PDT, dosimetry measurements must be performed with devices adapted to the geometry of the speciﬁc organ to be treated. The use of ﬂuorescent sensitizers as diagnostic and therapeutic agents in derma- tology goes back to Hermann von Tappeiner (1847–1927), director of the phar- macological institute at the university in Munich, in the late 19th century [1]. According to the ﬁndings of his student Raab (Z Biol 39:524–546, 1900) who discovered a light dependent phototoxicity in his cellular experiments [2], von Tappeiner introduced and published the term ‘‘photodynamic’’ in von Tappeiner and Jodlbauer (Dtsch Arch Klein Med 80:427–487, 1904). Since then, photo- therapy continuously developed and Finsen Ackroyd et al. (Photochem Photobiol 74:656–669, 2001) were awarded the Nobel Prize 1903 after he had treated 800 patients suffering from Lupus vulgaris. R.

The lowest energy state is called ground state S0. When additional energy is absorbed, this may happen by absorption of a photon with Energy, E = hm [3], then the molecule is excited and an energy transfer from S0 to higher orbitals (singlet states) occurs, generally to S1 as is illustrated in Fig. 4.1. From the excited state, the atom or molecule in about 10-7 s returns to the ground state by heat conversion of the energy or by emission of a photon (ﬂuorescence). The absorption of the photon energy depends on the wavelength and can be described by the formula: IðkÞ ¼ I010\u0002eðkÞ cd ¼ I0e\u0002lad where e(k) = extinction coefﬁcient, c = concentration of absorbing molecules, and d = path length of the light through the medium. In an equal expression, normally used by physicists, la (cm-1) is the absorption coefﬁcient. The ﬂuorescence intensity per solid angle, IF(k), is proportional to the excitation intensity I0 multiplied by the quantum efﬁciency g of the molecule: IFðkÞ ¼ I0½1 \u0002 10\u0002eðkÞ cd\u0003 g X=4p; with g: quantum yield and X: solid angle of isotropic ﬂuorescence radiation. From Fig. 4.1, it can be derived that the emission wavelength of the ﬂuores- cence is less in energy and therefore red-shifted (Fig. 4.2). This was ﬁrst dis- covered by Stokes in 1852. The energy levels of an atom or a molecule are often presented as a Jablonski diagram. In Fig. 4.3 the arrow A means the absorption of a photon and an electron transfer from the ground state to a higher singlet state from which by internal Fig. 4.1 Potential diagram of electronic states of a molecule in ground state S0 and excited state S1 with vibration levels mi 70 R. Steiner conversion the energy of the electron drops down to the lowest singlet S1 state. The energy is dissipated as heat. Now energy transfer from singlet state S1 may happen in case of ﬂuorescence by emission of a photon to the ground state with rate constant kF or by non radiative energy transfer also to another molecule with rate constant kET. In sensitizer molecules, the efﬁciency of the sensitizer is also determined by the probability of intersystem crossing from the S1 state to the long lasting triplet state T with rate constant kISC. Fig. 4.2 Stokes red-shift of ﬂuorescence emission. Excitation and emission are mirror-inverted in form Fig. 4.3 Jablonski diagram of energy levels of an excited molecule. The sum of the kinetic rate constants is related to the lifetime of the excited state 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 71 The overall rate constant k of the excited singlet state is the sum of all rate constants and correlated with the lifetime s: k ¼ kF þ kIC þ kISC þ kET ¼ 1=s: Fluorescence intensity is normally emitted isotropic, equal in all directions, and is not polarized. But when excited with polarized laser light, ﬂuorescence emission may have a certain degree of polarization P. Degree of polarization: P ¼ðIk \u0002 I?Þ=ðIk þ I?Þ where Ik is part of the ﬂuo- rescence intensity parallel to the exciting beam and I\\ vertical. The ﬂuorescence anisotropy is deﬁned as r. r ¼ Ik \u0002 I? \u0002\u0003 = Ik þ 2I? \u0002\u0003: Molecules may rotate during ﬂuorescence lifetime or change orientation. Therefore, from ﬂuorescence anisotropy a time constant sr for rotation diffusion can be calculated. sr ¼ gV=kBT, where kB = Boltzmann constant = 1.38 9 10-23 J/\u0003K,T and \u0003K = temperature, g = viscosity. For spherical molecules and molecular weight M in kilo Dalton (kDa) the rotation diffusion constant in ns is approximately: sr [ns] = M(kDa)/2 which is & 10 ns per 20 kDa. Fluorescence anisotropy for rod-shaped molecules with optical transmission dipole moment parallel to the molecular axis is rtðÞ ¼ r0 \u0002 r1ðÞe\u0002t=sr þ r1 and the rotation diffusion sr ~ g corresponds to the viscosity. Fluorescence anisotropy is measured with a simple experimental scheme like in Fig. 4.4. It is important for measuring cellular membrane phenomena. One example is Laurdan, when integrated into the membrane bi-layer, the generalized ﬂuorescence anisotropy is a measure of membrane ﬂuidity or membrane transport phenomena. The inset in Fig. 4.4 shows the polarization dependent ﬂuorescence kinetics of glioblastoma cells incubated with Laurdan. The intrinsic ﬂuorescence of tissue covers a wide spectral range from 300 to 700 nm (Fig. 4.5). Amino acids, Collagen, and Elastin contribute in the UV and deep blue region, Nicotinamide-Adenine-Dinucleotide-Hydrogen (NADH) in the blue, Flavines in the green-yellow, and Porphyrins in the red part of the spectrum. According to the composition of the layered skin and the concentrations of the different ﬂuorophores in different layers and depths, depth-resolved ﬂuorescence of the tissue when excited with different wavelengths, 349 and 457 nm, will be possible [4]. NADH ﬂuorescence is sensitive to ischemia, neoplasia, oxygen concentration, and metabolic functions of the tissue. Detection of lung cancer, precancerous, and malignant lesions, by autoﬂuorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) of mucosal tissue is already in clinical practice [5, 6]. The aim is to detect early stages of dysplasia 72 R. Steiner which cannot be imaged by spiral computer tomography (SCT) or standard CT [7]. Sputum cytology exhibits only 33 % of sensitivity and 64 % speciﬁcity [8]. In several studies, the advantages of AFB compared to white light bronchoscopy (WLB) are reported [9–12]. In a study with 4,983 patients [12], 1,148 male sub- jects had a pathologically conﬁrmed lung cancer and AFB exhibited a 3.41 times higher possibility of lung cancer in male subjects.

The sensitivities of AFB and WLB were 94.7 and 65.8 %, respectively, whereas the speciﬁcities were 57.0 and 83.6 %, respectively [11]. The lower value for the speciﬁcity of AFB is because of higher false-positive values due to ﬂuorescence of some nonmalignant lesions as well. Figure 4.6 gives an example of how to specify the characteristic ﬂuorescence of lung cancer in the upper airways. Three wave- lengths are used, blue (442 nm), green (520 nm), and red (630 nm). With blue light the tissue is excited and most of the ﬂuorescent molecules are located in the submucosa layer. In normal healthy mucosa (Fig. 4.6a), green ﬂuorescence is dominant (see also spectrum in Fig. 4.6d). When a malignant lesion in the mucosa layer is present, then, due to increased vascularisation, the intensity of the blue excitation is lowered by the blood absorption. The same happens with the green emitted ﬂuorescence. The intensity relation between green and red is inverted and the amount is strongly reduced. The spectral changes are evaluated, calibrated and displayed in false colors as overlay in the white light image (Fig. 4.6c). Several companies have devices for AFB on the market). Excitation of tissue with infrared ultra-short laser pulses and two-photon absorption or second harmonic microscopy are advanced technologies to get diagnostic information [13] which became more important during the last years. Another possibility to detect cancer of different organs, skin, bladder, lung or mouth, is photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using a tumour-selective photosensitizer. Fig. 4.6 Method of autoﬂuorescence bronchoscopy, a absorption and ﬂuorescence conditions of the three wavelengths, b bronchoscope, c example of an imaged lung cancer and d spectral conditions for healthy and cancerous tissue (Courtesy of Richard Wolf GmbH) 74 R. Steiner First trials were undertaken by Baumgartner [14] using inhalation of a 5-amino- levulinic acid (5-ALA) spray for ﬂuorescence detection of early stage lung cancer. Conventional clinical inhalation technique was a suitable method for topical 5- ALA application. With the uptake of 5-ALA, by the lung tissue and subsequent synthesis of ﬂuorescent Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), bronchial cancer could be detected. 4.1.1 Sensitizers The PDT is now more than hundred years old and the sensitizers exist in ﬁrst, second, and even third generation. The structures of most sensitizers are por- phyrins, chlorophylls, and dyes. The ﬁrst sensitizers were hematoporphyrin derivatives (DHE, ‘‘Photofrin’’) synthesized from heme [15]. Other examples are 5-ALA, Phthalocyanines, m-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC), or mono-L- aspartyl chlorine e6 (Talaporﬁn, NPe6). Several photosensitizers are commercially available for clinical use, with trademarks such as Photofrin, Photosens, Allumera, Visudyne (Verteporﬁn), Fo- scan, Metvix, Hexvix, Cysview, and Laserphyrin. New sensitizers are in Fig. 4.7 Example of the bio-transformation of AlPc-nanoparticles to the ﬂuorescent active monomeric form in skin inﬂammation (large peak) compared to normal skin and inﬂammatory tissue alone 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 75 development, e.g., PVP-Hypericin, Antrin, Photochlor, Photrex, Cevira, Lumacan, Visonac, Amphinex, and Azadipyrromethene (ADPM). Parallel to the development of molecular photosensitzers, nanoparticles and functionalized nanoparticles with high photostability and high quantum yield will become more important in future for PDD and also for PDT. Emission maximum of such nanoparticles depend on the particle size and can be shifted to the demand of speciﬁc applications. Nanoparticles are normally prepared from gold or com- positions of semiconductors. Other possibilities are nanoparticles prepared from insoluble organic photosensitzers like Phthalocyanines, nAlPc, or Chlorophylls [16]. They have interesting characteristics and are only ﬂuorescent by uptake in inﬂammatory tissues or tumors (Fig. 4.7). There, a biotransformation of nAlPc occurs to the active monomer form, especially interesting for skin diseases. Depending on the physico-chemical characteristics of the molecules the sen- sitizers enter differently into cells and are located in the cells and accumulated in different cellular organs. Therefore, the ﬂuorescence behavior and cellular reaction mechanisms are different. That is why cancer speciﬁc sensitizers are approved for PDD and PDT. Despite the differences, the sensitizers aim to achieve certain characteristics: • efﬁcient light absorption at longer wavelengths, because the spectral range between 700 and 850 nm has the deepest penetration into the tissue, • high singlet oxygen quantum yield, • high photostability (low photobleaching), • high quantum yield of natural ﬂuorescence for PDD by ﬂuorescence spectros- copy and for optical dosimetry measurements, • low dark toxicity not to be harmful for patients exposed to sunlight, • fast metabolism to be eliminated from the body, • preferential uptake in cancer tissue with high contrast to the neighboring normal tissue. The absorption conditions of several sensitizers are summarized in Fig. 4.8 and the physico-chemical characteristics with uptake conditions and intracellular localization in Fig. 4.9. Fig. 4.8 Maximum absorption of different sensitizers 76 R. Steiner An interesting new development of near-infrared ﬂuorescent proteins for whole-body imaging techniques for tumor localization, cell migration, and other studies involving deep-tissue imaging are the dimeric ﬂuorescent proteins, Kat- ushka, eqFP650, and eqFP670 [17]. The ﬁrst one is claimed the brightest ﬂuo- rescent protein with emission maximum above 635 nm, and the second displays the most red-shifted emission maximum and high photostability. The authors demonstrated that the dye Katushka, prepared from stable lines of transgenic Xenopus laevis is not cytotoxic. Some sensitizers have the potential to ﬁnd its way from a second to third generation photosensitizer [18]. This may be the case for mTHPC which exists in solution form (Foscan\u0004) and also in nanoformulations (Fospeg\u0004, Foslip\u0004). 4.2 Clinical Applications 4.2.1 Bladder Cancer The use of PDT for treatment of bladder cancer, ﬁrst licensed in Canada 1993 with Photofrin, was not quite satisfactory because 70–80 % of patients relapsed within a year [15]. PDD, however, gained more importance for the detection of incon- spicuous early stage urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Meanwhile, ﬂuorescence diagnosis has been approved in Europe for the detection of bladder cancer after instillation of 5-ALA, ALA (Hexvix\u0004), solution, and PDD is also recommended by the European Association of Urology as well as the Austrian Association of Urology for the diagnosis of carcinoma in situ of the bladder [19]. Drawback of PDD with ALA and its derivatives is the lower speciﬁcity because of false positive results. In several clinical studies [19], the sensitivity of PDD is compared to white light cystoscopy (WLC). The values for PDD varied from 92 to 97 % and for WLC from 67 to 84 %. The speciﬁcity, however, had a spread from 40 to 67 % for PDD and from 66 to 78 % for WLC. A combination and digital Fig. 4.9 Physico-chemical characteristics of sensitizers with corresponding cellular uptake and localization 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 77 overlay of both imaging technologies intermittently may further improve diag- nostic accuracy, especially for systems used in an outpatient environment. More promising results reveal studies with Hypericin [20] where the speciﬁcity is increased from 95 to 98 %. Also exact dosimetry and quantiﬁcation of ALA- induced ﬂuorescence improves the speciﬁcity of bladder cancer detection [21]. The enhanced diagnosis of hardly visible carcinoma in situ, CIS, by PDD is one of the most remarkable beneﬁts of this method and improves management of patients suffering from this disease. The probably shorted incubation time after instillation of PVP-Hypericin into the bladder for the ﬂuorescence detection will be an additional beneﬁt for the management of patients. 5-aminolelulinic acid is a natural substance and plays a role in the intracellular biochemical pathways as a heme precursor. Administration of ALA in excess enhances the Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) synthesis which is the ﬂuorescent com- pound. The higher metabolism in cancer cells give rise to higher content of PPIX and in consequence to enhanced ﬂuorescence compared to the surrounding healthy tissue. Figure 4.10 shows an example of bladder cancer diagnosis in comparison to WLC where the two satellite cancerous lesions are hardly to see. ALA can be applied as solution or cream for topical applications in dermatology. A compre- hensive overview of the basic principles and clinical applications of ALA is reported in the book by Pottier et al. [22]. New studies with Polyvinylpyrrolidone-Hypericin (PVP-Hypericin) demon- strate the potential of this sensitizer for PDD of early stages of bladder cancer. The incubation time can be shortened to about 30 min with sensitizer uptake of the cancer tissue to get sufﬁcient ﬂuorescence intensity for high-contrast images (Fig. 4.11). Fig. 4.10 Comparison of 5-ALA and hexyl-ALA. a PDD of bladder cancer with 5-ALA, b white light picture of the same bladder region (courtesy of Laser-Forschungslabor Grosshadern) 78 R. Steiner Hypericin, a component of St. Johns Wort, is one of the most powerful pho- tosensitizer in nature. Because of its hydrophobicity, the substance must be dis- solved in a mixture of DMSO, PEG, and water for systemic application. Hypericin seems to be quite an effective ﬂuorescence marker for the detection of glioma in vivo. Taking into account tissue autoﬂuorescence, the ﬂuorescence ratios between tumor and normal tissue as well as inﬁltration zone and normal tissue were about 19.8:1 and 2.5:1, respectively [23]. Another possibility is the polymeric nanoencapsulation of hypericin (NPs) to overcome the delivery and stability problems and enable intravenous administration [24]. Comparing hypericin-loaded nanoparticles to free drug for the ﬂuorescence photodetection of ovarian mi- crometastases it turned out that hypericin-loaded NPs showed improved selective accumulation of hypericin and higher ﬂuorescence intensities in ovarian micrometastases. The ﬁrst system for PDD has been developed in 1995 by company KARL STORZ with matched optical components, the D-Light C light source, the optics, and the sensitive endocamera. Such systems are available for PDD in ENT, neurosurgery, and laparoscopy. A ﬂexible PDD video-cystoscope is available from Richard Wolf GmbH with the Combilight light source. 4.2.2 Skin Cancer PDD/PDT is routinely used for superﬁcial skin cancers and precancerous lesions (actinic keratosis) in dermatology. 5-ALA-assisted ﬂuorescence examination is a useful tool to visualize the malignant or premalignant lesion and determine its margin. The ﬂuorescent skin area is normally larger than the visible tumor size. Besides demarcation of the tumor, the ﬂuorescence intensity can also be used to monitor the PDT effect during and after irradiation of the sensitized malignant Fig. 4.11 PDD of early cancer stage in the bladder with PVP-Hypericin (courtesy of Sanochemia Pharmazeutika AG) 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 79 tissue. For diagnostic purpose of superﬁcial skin lesions 5-ALA or Metvix\u0004 (methyl-5-aminolaevulinate) are used. Diagnosis and therapy of superﬁcial squa- mous cell carcinoma using 5-ALA with topical application are very promising [25]. For thicker and deeper lesions, however, systemic administration of the photosensitizer is indispensable. After ﬂuorescence imaging of the tumor size the photodynamic effect of the sensitizer together with light irradiation treats the tumor with excellent cosmetic results as demonstrated in Fig. 4.12. Not only ﬂuorescence imaging technologies are used to detect and monitor tumor lesions but also local spectroscopic examination of the tissue gives good results to judge tissue modiﬁcations [26, 27]. Multiple actinic keratosis can be visualized by application of Metvix\u0004 cream and treated with lamps (Waldmann) or LEDs selected for red light emission. An example is given in Fig. 4.13. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) exists in different forms: sclerodermiform (10 %), nodular (33 %), and superﬁcial (57 %). Normally, BCC do not metastasize but can aggressively destroy the tissue. PDD helps to demarcate the BCC lesion (Fig. 4.14) for surgical intervention. Only superﬁcial BCC lesions can be treated by PDT successfully. A comparison of ﬂuorescence diagnostics of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) with Metvix\u0004 and 5-ALA to visual clinical examination is reported in [28]. The authors found that the ﬂuorescence contrast using Metvix\u0004 is signiﬁcantly higher than the contrast after application of 5-ALA. Fig. 4.12 Squamous cell carcinoma. Fluorescence diagnosis with Metvix \u0004 and photodynamic treatment (PDT) (courtesy of C. Fritsch, Düsseldorf) Fig. 4.13 Diagnostic imaging of actinic keratosis with Metvix \u0004 (courtesy of C. Fritsch, Düsseldorf) 80 R. Steiner Also Bowen’s disease can be visualized with Metvix \u0004 and treated in multiple PDT sessions until the patient is cured. Negative results, no ﬂuorescence with Metvix\u0004 can be detected with malignant melanoma, viral warts, benign melano- cytic lesions, seborrhoic keratosis, and condylomata. First approaches are published for visualization and PDT treatment of malig- nant melanoma with aluminium tetrasulfophthalocyanines, AlPcS4 [29]ata concentration of 40 lg/ml and a laser light dose of 4.5 J/cm 2 at 672 nm wavelength. 4.3 Diagnostics of Other Tumor Types The percentage of adenocarcinoma within esophageal carcinomas was more than 2 decades ago only 5 %. But meanwhile, due to the dramatic increase of Barrett- carcinoma, it is the most frequent malignant esophageal tumor in the western countries. The risk that an adenocarcinoma develops from a Barrett-esophagus is 30- to 125-times higher than in normal population [30]. Also the fast development of endoscopic technologies and new diagnostic methods lead to a more frequent diagnosis of early stage neoplasias. In case of intraepithelial neoplasias or carci- nomas limited to the mucosa, endoscopic mucosal resection and PDT have been performed more and more often as an alternative to radical surgical resection. High resolution video endoscopy is the standard diagnostic of Barrett-esophagus toge- ther with PPIX-enhanced ﬂuorescence after 5-ALA oral application. For PDT also Dihematoporphyrin (DHE, sensitizer of the ﬁrst generation) and mTHPC are effectively used, but which create more side effects. Problematic are still the dosimetry and the homogeneous irradiation of the Barrett-esophagus. Also auto- ﬂuorescence endoscopy on the basis of the natural ﬂuorescence of endogenous ﬂuorophores calculating the red to green ratio (R/G) of the autoﬂuorescence images is a powerful tool to detect tissue alterations. An increased R/G ratio in cancerous tissue changes in 96 % of the cases is reported in [31]. Fig. 4.14 BCC with Metvix \u0004 (courtesy of C. Fritsch, Düsseldorf) 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 81 PDD of prostate cancer with 5-ALA is validated in clinical trials [32, 33]. Fluorescence markers for PDD of tumor margins during surgery would enhance the surgical radicality. PDD with 5-ALA- induced PPIX ﬂuorescence imaging during radical prostatectomy might be an effective method for reducing the rate of positive surgical margin (PSM) which is associated with biochemical recurrence in 11–38 % of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Optical and especially ﬂuorescence diagnosis of in head and neck oncology is rapidly developing and can be translated to enhance patient treatment and overall quality of life [34]. PDD is successfully applied also in brain tumors, malignant glioma, using 5- ALA [35] or the new sensitizer hypericin [23] for ﬂuorescence image-guided resection of the tumors. Further and new applications of PDD serve as detection method for metastasis of ovarian cancer [36] or lung cancer. 4.4 Methodological and Technical Aspects It was mentioned that dosimetry in PDT and PDD is a crucial factor for diagnostic decisions and therapy control. Spectroscopic ﬂuorescence measurements are usually the way to collect data on photosensitizer concentration, photobleaching, or accumulation in tumors compared to healthy tissue. With a ﬂexible optical ﬁber bundle, containing a central ﬁber for ﬂuorescence excitation surrounded by several detection ﬁbers, the distal tip is in contact or in short distance to the tissue for the measurements. The ﬂuorescence spectral intensity, monitoring the sensitizer amount in the tissue, is digitally calibrated and displayed. There are devices on the market [37] and very frequently used is the system LESA-01-BIOSPEC of the company BioSpec, Moscow [38]. It measures with high sensitivity tissue auto- ﬂuorescence and all popular photosensitizers for quantitative determination of the photosensitizer concentration in vivo. Dosimetry results of PpIX in human non- melanoma skin cancers and precancers show that PpIX accumulation correlates with the degree of malignancy [39]. Besides molecular sensitizers different functionalized nanoparticles, mostly gold nanoparticles [40], are in experimental stage for tumor diagnosis. Their advantages are high ﬂuorescence quantum yield and photostability. A new approach is the use of nanoparticles produced of aluminium phthalocyanine (nAlPc). Such nAlPc, produced in different size, are not ﬂuorescent in water suspension. In the body, however, they start to be ﬂuorescent but only in inﬂamed tissue [41]. Experiments reveal that stimulated macrophages after internalization of nAlPc begin to ﬂuoresce due to single molecules being dissolved from the nanoparticles. An example is demonstrated in Fig. 4.15. Accurate surgical removal of tumors depends on the quality of tumor imaging. New techniques for imaging aggressive brain tumors (glioblastoma) involve triple- modality nanoparticles [42]. After being injected into the blood, the nanoparticles are able to penetrate brain tumor cells and tag them with a label that the cells can 82 R. Steiner be more easily detected by three complementary imaging technologies: MRI, which images the entire brain and the tumor, photoacoustic imaging, which can visualize the tumor in three dimensions and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) imaging, which has ultra-high sensitivity and resolution and therefore can visualize microscopic residual tumor. 4.4.1 Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Fluorescence of a ﬂuorophor has a speciﬁc lifetime depending on the chemical environment of the molecule. Therefore, the ﬂuorescence decay time of molecules helps to identify molecules and intracellular pathways even if the ﬂuorescence spectra would be identical. Fluorescence-guided tumor resection is very well accepted in the case of bladder cancer and some types of brain tumor, respectively. However, false positive results are one of the major problems of ﬂuorescence diagnosis, which will make the discrimination between tumor tissue and inﬂam- mation difﬁcult. But ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and especially spectral- resolved FLIM (SLIM) [43] can signiﬁcantly improve the diagnostic value. The ﬂuorescence decay of a ﬂuorophor, in many cases, does not follow a simple exponential proﬁle. A very complex situation may arise, when more than one Fig. 4.15 Spectra of nAlPc ﬂuorescence in mouse normal and inﬂamed tissue, excited with 633 nm wavelength. Inset shows the nAlPc ﬂuorescence of stimulated macrophages. Graph on the left side displays the calibrated ﬂuorescence intensities of the normal tissue (24, 29, 30) and inﬂamed tissue (25, 26, 28). Spectra are measured with LESA-01 BIOSPEC 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 83 compound has to be analyzed. This could be the case when endogenous ﬂuoro- phores of living cells or in tissues have to be discriminated to identify oxidative metabolic changes or during PDT, when different photosensitizer metabolites are observed simultaneously. In those cases, a considerable improvement could be achieved when time-resolved and spectral-resolved techniques are simultaneously available. Time-resolved imaging considers the ﬂuorescence lifetime s of a ﬂuorophor which for most organic molecules is in the sub-nanosecond to nanosecond time range. Although ﬂuorescence lifetimes can be in principal obtained in the fre- quency or time domain, the technique described considers only the time domain version. In this case, the sample is excited by picosecond pulses at high repetition rate (kHz–MHz). For the detection of time-resolved ﬂuorescence, time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) or time-gating techniques are used. The TCSPC technique is based on the measurement of the arrival time of the ﬁrst emitted photon relative to the excitation pulse. Single photons are detected by fast photomultipliers (PMTs). This technique enables highest accuracy [44]. Applications presented here focus on the detection of NADH and 5-ALA (5- ALA) induced porphyrins. With respect to NADH, the discrimination between protein bound and free coenzyme was investigated in squamous carcinoma cells from different origin. These measurements allow a deeper understanding of the metabolic state of the cells. The redox ratio, which means the ratio between the ﬂuorescence intensity of FAD versus NADH is known to depend on the metabolic state [45]. This ratio is correlated with the ﬂuorescence lifetimes of NADH and FAD. For low grade and high grade precancerous tissue, a shortening of the lifetime of NADH was recently reported, whereas FAD exhibited an elongation [46]. Fig. 4.16 Schematic diagram of the setup for SLIM. For explanation see text 84 R. Steiner A schematic scheme of the measurement setup is given in Fig. 4.16. In order to investigate multispectral FLIM of NADH and FAD, a tunable Ti: Sapphire laser (Mai Tai AX HPDS, Spectra Physics) is coupled to a laser scanning microscope (LSM710, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The Mai Tai laser is a mode-locked 80 MHz ‘‘high performance’’ DeepSee laser with a tuning range of 690–1,040 nm, a maximum optical output power of about 2.8 W at 800 nm and a pulse width below 100 fs. For cellular studies of the autoﬂuorescence, cells were excited with two photons at 720 nm, the power at the input of the microscope was reduced to 60 mW. Spectral detection of FLIM was done using narrow band pass ﬁlters at 436 nm (BP 436 ± 10 nm) and 470 nm (BP 470 ± 10 nm) and a two channel TCSPC system (Becker&Hickl GmbH, Berlin, Germany) consisting on a Simple- Tau-152-DX, SPC-Image, and the hybrid detector HPM-100-40. This system was coupled to the LSM 710. For each photon, the TCSPC module determines the location within the scan- ning area and the time of the photon within the laser pulse period. These parameters are used to build up a two-dimensional photon distribution over the scan area, and the time of the ﬂuorescence decay. The results are presented at an image size of 256 9 256 pixels and 256 time channels. A scan time of 782 ms was used and a collection time of 60 s to record the data. The microscope objective lens was a 20 9 magniﬁcation NA 0.8 water immersion lens (‘‘Plan-Apochromat’’ 20x/0.8, Carl Zeiss, Germany). With the used zoom factor of two, an area of 212 9 212 lm 2 was evaluated. In order to measure the ﬂuorescence lifetime of 5-ALA-induced porphyrins, a PML-16 multichannel PMT module with the TCSPC 830 (Becker&Hickl GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was attached to the output of a MS 125 spectrograph (LOT- Oriel) described in [43]. The PML 16 contains a 16 channel Hamamatsu R5900- 01-L16 multi-anode PMT and the TCSPC routing electronics [44]. The spectro- graph with a grating of 600 lines/mm has a 200 nm spectral range spread over the 16 channels of the detector. Fluorescence light from the sample is coupled into a 1000 lm silica/silica ﬁber with the end of the ﬁber coupled to the input focal plane of the spectrograph. For ﬂuorescence excitation, a 405 nm ps pulsed diode laser (BDL-405-SMC, Becker&Hickl GmbH, Berlin, Germany) is coupled to a 600 lm silica/silica ﬁber. Pulse repetition rate of the diode laser is 40 MHz. With this system, the spectral-resolved ﬂuorescence lifetime data of 5-ALA-induced por- phyrins is measured within the illuminated area. The time-resolved ﬂuorescence of NADH was studied in the human oral keratinocyte line OKF6/TERT-2 and two human oral squamous cell carcinoma SCC-4 and SCC-25 cells. Protein bound NADH was studied within 436 ± 10 nm and free NADH within 470 ± 10 nm. Excitation wavelength was in both cases 720 nm. A two exponential ﬁtting procedure was used to calculate the ﬂuorescence lifetimes of bound and unbound NADH. The distribution of the short component for both spectral regions (BP 436 and BP 470) is shown in Fig. 4.17, the distri- bution for the long component in Fig. 4.18. Interestingly, two lifetimes were found for the short component being attributed to the unbound NADH. The unbound coenzyme should be found in a higher 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 85 amount within the range BP 470. In fact, the intensity of the short component is higher in the channel BP 470. The difference in the short lifetimes is marginal for the three types of cells; it seems that SCC-4 cells exhibit the longest lifetime s1. Fig. 4.17 FLIM and distribution histogram of the short lifetime component of bound (BP 436) and free (BP 470) NADH Fig. 4.18 FLIM and distribution histogram of the long lifetime component of NADH bound (BP 436) and unbound (BP 470) 86 R. Steiner For the long lifetime component s2, the difference is more signiﬁcant (see Fig. 4.18). Again, SCC-4 cells possess the longest value, which may reﬂect a different protein binding state. The lifetime is the crucial parameter to describe the different binding envi- ronments for NADH. However, for characterization of different cell types, the distribution of the intensity of the short compound versus the intensity of the long compound gives a more detailed image of the intracellular variation. Therefore, the intensity ratio Is1/Is2, will be calculated which is equal to a1s1/a2s2, where a1 and a2 are the amplitudes of the short and long lifetime component, respectively. The image of a1s1/a2s2 in false colors and the histogram for the three cell lines within the two different spectral regions is demonstrated in Fig. 4.19. For SCC-4 the long lifetime component is prominent and the concentration is high in the cytoplasm and seems to be correlated with mitochondria (see orange color in channel BP 436). The two other cells (OKF6/TERT-2 and SCC-25) demonstrate a similar histogram with a higher concentration of the short compound, localized signiﬁcantly in the cell nucleus. This fact is interesting because free NADH in the cell nucleus is known to play a role in gene expression [47]. Cell metabolism of OKF6 and SCC-25 on the one hand and SCC-4 on the other hand seems to be different. The evaluation of the spectral and time-resolved ﬂuorescence characteristics of 5-ALA-induced porphyrins in OKF6, SCC-4, and SCC-25 cells has been per- formed on the chorioallantois membrane (CAM) of advanced brooded hen eggs. The cells were incubated for 3 h with 5-ALA and analyzed with the 16-channel detector. The mean lifetime values calculated with a single exponential ﬁtting Fig. 4.19 Distribution of a1s1/a2s2 in false colors and histogram for the three cell lines in the two spectral regions BP 436 and BP 470 4 Diagnostic and Laser Measurements in PDT 87 procedure and standard deviations within the different spectral channels for the three cells is demonstrated in Fig. 4.20. Administration of 5-ALA stimulates porphyrin synthesis like protopophyrin IX (PpIX), uroporphyrin I and III (UroI and III), and coproporphyrin (Copro) in cells (Fig. 4.21). PpIX is assumed to be the most important component. Fig. 4.20 Mean ﬂuorescence lifetimes of 5-ALA induced porphyrins, autoﬂuorescence and standard deviations in OKF6, SCC-4 and SCC-25 cells. Mean value from seven single measurements Fig. 4.21 Protein synthesis pathways after administration of 5-ALA and PDT 88 R. Steiner The main ﬂuorescence band of PpIX is found in the channel around 633 nm, a second band is found at 696 nm. As can be seen in Fig. 4.20, the ﬂuorescence lifetime which correlates with PpIX is between 12 and 14 ns for all cell types and seems to be shorter for SCC-4, the difference is, however, statistically not sig- niﬁcant. However, the ﬂuorescence at 621 nm, which correlates with Uro and/or Copro exhibits a lifetime which is statistically signiﬁcant shorter in the case of SCC-4. From the literature, it is known that the lifetime of Uro is around 6 ns, which coincides well with the SCC-4 cells [48]. The ﬁrst three channels correlate with the autoﬂuorescence, channel 658 and 671 nm with aggregates and photoproducts. From these measurements 5-ALA metabolism seems to be different for OKF6 and SCC-25 on the one hand and SCC-4 on the other hand. As demonstrated, FLIM and SLIM can be the right method to measure cell metabolism and to discriminate different cell types. Cell metabolism, especially the redox-state of the cells is reﬂected by the ﬂuorescence behavior of enzymes which are responsible for the autoﬂuorescence. As an example, studies of the ﬂuorescence lifetime of the most important coenzyme of the respiratory chain, the protein bound and unbound NADH in cells of different origin have been performed. Measurements of the lifetimes of 5-ALA-induced porphyrins in the same types of cells indicated that the normal keratinocyte line OKF6 and the squamous car- cinoma cell SCC-25 behave similar, both with respect to autoﬂuorescence and 5- ALA-induced ﬂuorescence. The more aggressive squamous carcinoma cell SCC-4 behaved differently. Also cell growth and morphology were similar in the case of OKF6 and SCC-25. It seems that the ﬂuorescence lifetime reﬂects cell metabolism in a very sensitive way. Improvement of ﬂuorescence diagnosis by FLIM and SLIM could therefore be a method to overcome problems like false positive results or discrimination between different tumor states, tumor, and inﬂammation.

The list of medical ﬁelds in which PDT has managed to ﬁnd a place as an accepted option for speciﬁc problems includes gastroenterology, dermatology, gynaecology, ophthalmology, and ENT. It is increasing importance underlined by a comparison with both tra- ditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which can often signiﬁcantly compromise patient’s health. The therapeutic use of these well-established therapies is accordingly limited by their toxicity. In contrast, PDT cannot only show a distinct degree of tumor speciﬁcity, but can be repeatedly applied without apparently damaging the health of the patient. 5.1 Introduction 5.1.1 The Basis of PDT ‘‘Photodynamic therapy’’ (PDT) is a term encompassing a collection of both curative and palliative modalities, traditionally described as treating precancerous lesions and superﬁcial tumors using light.

In contrast, PDT cannot only show a distinct degree of tumor speciﬁcity, but can be repeatedly applied without apparently damaging the health of the patient. Historically, PDT looks back on a long empirical evolution. Its beginnings are to be found in antiquity in Egypt. However, a satisfactory theory as to how it actually works could be developed only during the last few decades. In principle, sub- stances, called photosensitizers, absorb optical energy and transmit this to oxygen molecules, thereby forming highly aggressive forms of oxygen-based molecules. The latter is often denoted by the term ‘‘reactive oxygen species’’ (‘‘ROS’’). PDT’s ancient roots are explicable because of the natural occurrence of photosensitizers with a signiﬁcant capacity for forming ROS. These include, for example, biliru- bine and the ﬂavines. Following, the uptake of photosensitizer by individual cells or cell groups, the absorption of light with consequent generation of ROS results in their death. Essentially, the therapeutic value arises from a more or less selective uptake of certain photoensitizers by precancerous or cancerous tissue [1, 12] (Fig. 5.1). 5.2 Clinical Aspects in Classiﬁcation of Photosensitizers PDT is an intrinsically selective therapy, in the sense that some photoactive sub- stances accumulate more in degenerate than in the normal tissue. Such an accu- mulation, together with a precise application of light, determine how discriminating PDT can be in distinguishing between degenerate and healthy tissue with respect to inﬂicting damage. It has to be remembered that the selective enrichment in the target tissue depends not only on the photosensitizer, but also on differences in cell composition and compartmentalization. In contrast, the extent to which optical energy is channeled into oxygen activation is a physical quantity that, in analogy to the absorption spectrum, is characteristic for each individual substance and depends on the particular optical wavelength in question [20, 23, 31]. Fig. 5.1 Basics of PDT. The Trias of PDT 94 H.-P. Berlien The photosensitizers that are of interest regarding current and future clinical applications can be classiﬁed and exploited according to their different chemical, physical, and pharmacokinetic qualities. The same major aim, the selective gen- eration of singlet oxygen in the tumor cells and their destruction, is fundamentally valid for all photosensitizers. As far as topical PDT is concerned, prominent photosensitizers include the thiazin dyes methylene blue and toluidine blue, and the protoporphyrin IX precursor d-aminolaevulic acid. 5.2.1 Substances 5.2.1.1 Dyes The thiazine dyes contain a triple ring system and represent a widely used class of photosensitizer which are topically applied on mucous membranes, e.g., in den- tistry, where the destruction of bacteria via PDT without signiﬁcant side effects is currently being researched clinically. They are also used to treat superﬁcial lesions of mucous membranes in the ﬁeld of ENT and dentistry, e.g., leukoplakia, where long remission rates have been achieved. Methylene blue (Fig. 5.2) is soluble in water, and has a broad absorption band in the red area of the spectrum with a maximum, depending to an extent on the solvent, around 665 nm. Toluidine blue is very similar, but a maximum that corresponds to somewhat shorter wavelengths, around 625 nm. Being water soluble, it cannot pass easily through biological membranes, and ﬁnds use in topical but not in systemic PDT. Another since decades well-known substance with a high PDT-potential is Indo-Cyano-Green (ICG). All substances have the great advantage of nearly no dark toxicity. But due to their elimination by the liver they can use only topical or in case of ICG just at the ﬁrst pass [13, 33]. 5.2.1.2 Tetrapyrroles The substances most frequently used in systemic PDT are the family of tetra- pyrroles, which belong to the ﬁrst generation photosensitizers (Fig. 5.3). The chlorins, which form one of the groups of the second generation photosensitizers Fig. 5.2 Methylene blue 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 95 and are in essence reduced porphyrins, are ﬁnding increasing use. Bacteriochlo- rophyll derivates and pheophorbides, stable derivates of chlorophyll varieties that are found in bacteria, are related to the porphyrins and are simple to produce. Phthalocyanins and naphthalocyanins, which are azaporphyrin derivates, show high tumor selectivity, are simple to synthesize and are very stable. They are also associated with a high yield of reactive oxygen species. Porphyrins are the most frequently used photosensitizers in PDT, and their well-established effectiveness makes them the standard for the newer substances [9, 11, 21]. In 1913 Meyer-Betz conducted the ﬁrst documented clinical trial in the modern history of the PDT in the form of a self experiment with i.v. injection of hematoporphyrin. A wealth of experience has since been gathered with porphyrins, and because of their efﬁcacy and low intrinsic toxicity, they make up most of the photosensitizers in current clinical use. Ubiquitous in nature, the decades since 1913 have seen improvements with respect to the chemical and photophysical qualities. The aims of present developments include progress regarding the • selectivity, i.e., speciﬁcity, through better retention in degenerate than in healthy tissue • clinical response • side effects • depth of the tumor tissue which can be handled efﬁciently • monitoring and control of the therapy. 5.2.2 Pharmakokinetics Knowledge of the pharmakokinetics of a photosensitizer is of essential importance for an optimal therapy planning. This includes determining the best time to irra- diate and the adopting the correct strategy regarding the most important side effects, for example, the photo sensibilization of the skin or the retina, in their anticipation. This will of course be based to a large extent on ﬁeld experience, but a good idea of the dynamics of the transportation and distribution of the photo- sensitizer between the various compartments, including the blood and liquor as well as the individual organs, is indispensable. Most of our knowledge about the Fig. 5.3 Classiﬁcation of Photosensitizer 96 H.-P. Berlien tissue distributions of photosensitizers comes from animal experiments, though the analysis of sera from patients also provides essential information on transportation phenomena. In vitro studies on the binding of photosensitizers to albumin and other proteins in blood, and the exchange of substances between the various vehicles involved, e.g., between albumin and lipoproteins, also serve to shed light on these matters. [10, 18, 29] 5.2.2.1 Photosensitizer Delivery and Transportation It appears that hydrophilic substances, including hematoporphyrin and porphyrins substituted with hydrophilic side groups, are transported generally with albumin, the hydrophobic ones in lipoproteins, including LDLs. The selective uptake (Fig. 5.4) of certain photosensitizers could then be partly explained by an increased expression of LDL receptors by tumor cells, which can depend on proliferation. However, the distribution will depend on the dose used, as well as the homogeneity of the photosensitizer. HpD, for example, corresponds to a mixture of oligomers, and when, applied intravenously, a signiﬁcant portion forms aggregates in blood, even though most becomes bound to albumin. The distribu- tion proﬁle can be complicated by transfers from albumin-bound photosensitizer to lipoproteins. 5.2.2.2 Tissue Uptake: The Problem of Targeting The accumulation in a tissue occurs both through passive mechanisms, such as an intrinsically high membrane afﬁnity and leakiness in the tumor vasculature. Active ones, such as the selective uptake of photosensitizer in the cells through carrier Fig. 5.4 Speciﬁc uptake ratio (SUR = C/D). C = Photosensitizer-concentration per g tissue. D = Photosensibitizer-dosage per kg body-weight 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 97 systems, can also play a role. For example, experiments involving 14C-labeled hematoporphyrin derivative [6], revealed triexponential kinetics for the clearance from the blood, the excretion of the majority of the substance in the faeces and the accumulation in organs of the reticuloendothelial system, e.g., the liver and spleen. The last fact was interpreted as pointing to the possible involvement of macro- phages in the process of tissue uptake. Apart from the possibility of a direct uptake of photosensitizer, precursors in the sense of prodrugs can be given, for example, d-aminolaevulic acid, that are taken into the cell and then converted to the active form, which would be protoporphyrin IX in the given example. Photosensitizers (such as phthalocyanins) can be bound to carrier molecules such as lipoproteins or antibodies before injection. This offers the pos- sibility of increasing the selective uptake by the targeted tissue and, for hydrophobic substances, of allowing an intravenous application in the ﬁrst place [8]. The distribution at the cellular level itself is an additional and crucial factor that needs to be taken into account in trying to understand the patterns of damage that PDT can inﬂict. Thus, hydrophilic photosensitizers are found to be concentrated primarily in lysosomes and in the cytoplasma, hydrophobic ones on the other hand in the various membrane systems, for example, those of the mitochondria, the endoplasmatic reticulum, and the cell membrane itself [22]. One can very well imagine for the sake of argument, for instance, that the destructive effects of a high rate of ROS generation restricted to the lysomes of a cell may be nowhere as deletirious as a signiﬁcantly lower rate located in the nucleus or the mitochondrial membranes. It should, therefore, be clear that the proper and comprehensive concept of a target should not simply be taken to mean an organ, a cell or some part of a cell. The aim is ultimately not simply selective uptake but rather selective cell death. Passive accumulation mechanisms can include the delayed breakdown of the photosensitizer into photochemically ineffective metabolites and its delayed clearance from the tissue. 5.2.2.3 Administration Route Dyes can be only administered topically except the ICG. But even in this dyes the mucosal penetration capability on one hand; on the other hand the standing time of the jelly is not long enough for a passive penetration so the capsulation with liposomes is used. ALA can be administered topically and systemic by intestinal resorption. In both cases not the drug itself works but only the intracellular produced and in dysplastic/malignant cells higher and longer retained PPIX. Principally, all the other PS can be administered topically or systemic. But for the majority of these substances due to great molecule the skin and the mucous membrane are a barrier for resorption (Fig. 5.5). Here are strong intraepithelial dysplasias without any vascularisation (IENIII/ CIS) topical substances the drug of choice. But with thicker lesions the penetration 98 H.-P. Berlien of these topical substances is not safe enough and with vascularisation and stroma formation the indication change to systemic photosensitizers. Here, we have beside the more or less speciﬁc accumulation in the tumor cells the secondary effect of destruction of the tumor vessels. General one can say: The more dysplasia/CIS with no vascularization—the more topical. The more tumor with stroma and vascularization—the more systemic 5.2.2.4 Elimination Photosensitizer elimination occurs via the liver and kidneys. Measurements on the elimination in faeces and urine with animals point to haematoporphyrin as being essentially hepatically eliminated. Interestingly, certain phthalocyanins appear to be eliminated to a very signiﬁcant extent in the urine. The ratio of excreted photosensitizer concentration in urine to that in the faeces is not constant, probably reﬂecting shifts in the distribution between the various blood and tissue compartments. In discussing the elimination, the plasma clearance also has to be considered. This will generally not show a simple exponential fall in plasma concentration, but rather a multicomponent behavior with components having half-lives between a few days and over a month. Another aspect in systemic photosensitizers is the accumulation time. From the aspect of patients care a short acting PS with short unwanted skin sensitivity seems the best one. But with this advantage one get two other limitations: The speciﬁc uptake ratio (SUR) depends by the interacting time—the longer— the higher the PS in the target tissue in relation (not necessarily the absolute concentration) to the surrounding tissue and the short time window for irradiation. Fig. 5.5 Application forms 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 99 5.2.2.5 Vascular Damage and Hypoxia In PDT, effects that are not speciﬁc to degenerate cells can also play an important role in tumor control. Almost all photosensitizers employed at this time, including the hematoporphyrins, have a high afﬁnity to the endothelium of blood vessels. Therefore, as could be expected, one of the regular consequences of PDT is a destruction of blood vessels. In fact, the effects on the vasculature are essentially the very ﬁrst ones seen. Inﬂammatory reactions, with edema, vasoconstrictive and vasodilatative phases and hemorrhagic necrosis [25]. This can have a considerable impact on the overall results. Such an effect could well be disadvantageous near diffusely inﬁltrating tumors, because of the risk of extensive necrosis and exces- sive soft tissue destruction. Since an adequate tumor selectivity in this respect is not given, the effects of the PDT on the healthy tissue would have to be minimized by an exact planning of the irradiation ﬁeld. However, this unselective process can also have certain advantages: – tumor regions with a poor microcirculation, and which therefore would not be capable of taking up sufﬁcient photosensitizer for a selective effect, may also be controlled, and – even an adequate perfusion in the irradiated volume may be reduced so much, that tumor cells which may have been only reversibly damaged through the PDT nevertheless die. A very clear disadvantage of the resulting acute hypoxia is the loss of the key component oxygen to the process of PDT itself. This line of thought leads to the possibility that fractionation is at least as important to PDT as it is to radiotherapy, on condition that the hypoxia induced both by vascular occlusion and the acti- vation of oxygen by photosensitizer is reversible. As far as the damage to the vasculature through PDT using, among others, hematoporphyrin derivative seems to depend strongly on the level of photosen- sitizer in the blood [16]. 5.3 Light Source 5.3.1 Inﬂuence of Spectral Range In the spectral range from UV light to the deep infrared, the penetration depth of light in tissue grows with increasing wavelength (Fig. 5.6). On this basis alone, the excitation of a photosensitizer at the longest possible wavelength would generally be advantageous. Limitations are imposed by the discrete (line) nature of the photosensitizer absorption spectra. With hematoporphyrin derivates, currently the most frequently employed photosensitizers, an optical wavelength of approxi- mately 635 nm is generally used. This corresponds to the absorption peak lying 100 H.-P. Berlien furthest in the red. In in vivo experiments, measurements show that the penetration depth of light at such a wavelength is approximately 1 cm. Clinical results, however, show that damage to the targeted tissue can occur to a depth of several centimetres (Fig. 5.7). This results by the fact that the so-called ‘‘penetration depth’’ means only the reduction of the irradiated power density on the surface is reduced in a given depth to 1/e2. It means not that beyond are no photons. So the higher the amount of Photons in a collimated beam the higher the remaining photons in a given depth (=‘‘reaction depth’’). The limit is the maximum power density on the surface to avoid secondary damages (see Sect. 4.4). Nevertheless, this restriction regarding the penetration means that the use of PDT is limited to that of superﬁcial lesions, for example, superﬁcial precancerous lesions or tumors, or the palliative treatment of cutaneous metastases. Deeper lying tissue would have to be treated by means of an interstitial PDT. A central aim of current research is the development of photosensitizers which can be usefully employed at longer wavelengths [2, 14, 19]. There are speciﬁc indications, for instance, the treatment of a Barrett esophagus or bladder cancer, for which light with a shorter wavelength, such as provided by the argon or KTP-laser, is employed. Its wavelength of 514 nm or 534 nm, respectively, also corresponds to one of the absorption peaks of hematoporphyrin derivates. This, however, represents the exceptional deliberate use of a restriction Relative Haemoglobin 400nm 500nm 600nm 800nm 1µm 2µm 3µm 4µm 8µm 10µm Fig. 5.6 Relative absorption of light by water and the pigment hemoglobin Fig. 5.7 Inﬂuence of photon ﬂux 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 101 in the light penetration. The idea lying behind this method is to avoid damage to deeper lying structures. Nevertheless, it demonstrates how PDT can be modulated through the tailored choice of the wavelength used. PDT did start in the ancient Egypt with sunlight, got the ﬁrst scientiﬁc upturn in the beginning twentieth century with introduction of high power electric arc lamps. But all these light sources emit incoherent non-collimated multi-wavelength light so the application was limited. With introduction of the LASER as a coherent, collimated, and monochromatic light source in the 70th the next upturn happened. But the question is is LASER necessary. The coherence is the condition for diagnostic, e.g., in OCT as the name says, but in therapy not. If in future 2-photon activation in PDT will happen is not yet clear. The monochromaticity is a ‘‘conditio sine qua non,’’ due to reduction of unwanted side effects of non-active wavelength in conventional light—the intro- duction of multispectral ﬂash lamps (‘‘IPL’’) once again is a roll backwards into the 20th of the twentieth century. 5.3.2 Inﬂuence of Collimation The collimation of LASER allows the coupling into ﬁbers for endoscopic or interstitial application. But for large ﬁeld irradiation the Gaussian distribution would cause inhomogeneous irradiation and needs special ﬁber end-faces. One aspect of collimation is the calculable forward photon scattering so that thicker lesions can be irradiated. With introduction of high power LED we have a new situation. The LED emits a narrow band of light which is for a speciﬁc PS-activation precise enough. Furthermore, due to formation of a large number of LED’s in one unit a large ﬁeld irradiation is possible. But in two aspects one has to take into account: Due to the non-collimation the inﬂuence of the distance to the power density is much greater than by LASER so only ﬂat surfaces can be irradiated with controlled parameters. The other aspect is that with non-collimation the forward-scattering is reduced and we have more backscattering with a higher under-surface intensity (Fig. 5.8). This must not be good or bad, it is a fact. In strong intraepithelial lesions by LEDs the underlying tissue is preserved against unwanted irradiation, but thicker lesions cannot irradiated in their full thickness with remaining tumor cells. 5.3.3 Light Access Route Due to the fact that Laser light can be transmitted by ﬁbers not only the surface can be irradiated even any operation ﬁeld and intracorporal regions. In case of skin lesions and mucosa near natural oriﬁciae a direct irradiation can happen, in the 102 H.-P. Berlien same way in intraoperative situs like neurosurgery. Here, even it is very important to control the beam parameters. The light transport in the ﬁber follows the Gaussian intensity proﬁle. This means that in the center of the beam one has a much higher number of photons/power density than in the periphery. In focused beams one has to take into account that after the focus the beam is divergent the more, the smaller the focus. To overcome these problems special light distribution systems are necessary (Fig. 5.9). Fig. 5.8 Why do LASER penetrate deeper? Fig. 5.9 Choice of access 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 103 5.3.4 Light Applicator Systems Focussed light application plays only in ophthalmology an important role for the treatment of senile macula degeneration. In all other application a large ﬁeld or diffuse irradiation is necessary. For a well-marked irradiation of a surface is instead a bare ﬁber—due to the above-explained problems—the applicator of choice a so-called ‘‘Microlens’’ ﬁber. With a lens at the ﬁber end the primary divergent and Gaussian beam gets a homogenious power density over the whole surface. This allows a precise calculation of the irradiation parameters. Due to the ﬂexibility of these applicators they even can be used in endoscopy. But for homogenious irra- diation in longer hollow organs or for interstitial applications from interstitial thermotherapy well-known diffuse light applicators are in use (Fig. 5.10). 5.4 Perioperative Management 5.4.1 Photosensitization The photosensitization of the skin, the most important side effect of PDT with porphyrins, corresponds to that known from experience with other photoactive substances such as antibiotics, phytotherapeutic agents and cosmetics. Depending Fig. 5.10 Applicators 104 H.-P. Berlien on the sensitizer used and the degree of exposure to light, this sensitization can take on an appearance ranging from a simple polymorphous light dermatosis (sun allergy) up to a serious epidermolysis or necrosis such as seen with congenital erythropoetic porphyria. The basic mechanism of this porphyria corresponds exactly to photodynamic therapy. As a rule, such skin irritations are short-lived, and permanent scars occur only in cases of absolute disregard of protective measures. The same risk happens for the cornea and retina. [7, 30] One possible solution is to take the patients in the dark for this photosensiti- zation time. But, e.g., in some tetrapyrroles the skin photosensitization time can take several days. On the other hand, just these patients are often with palliative cancer therapy where the life quality is a very important aspect. Here is the yellow light of the Sodium vapor lamp—well-known as a street lamp—a perfect solution. Nearly, all Photosensitizers have an excitation gap in the yellow. On the other hand, our eyes have the highest sensitivity for the visual process just in this wavelength. This means that with low illumination which cannot cause any skin or retinal photosensitization the patients have the full visual capacity to read books, hygienic purposes in the bathroom including use the shower. With daily skin spectroscopy the total amount of PS in the skin can be measured and by a light step the risk for phototoxic reactions can be reduced. 5.4.2 Metabolic Disorders The major part of the metabolism and elimination of hematoporphyrin derivates takes place in the liver. However, a poor liver function does not automatically represent a contraindication for the application of these substances, since their use displays a large therapeutic width, due to their low intrinsic toxicity. In patients with liver malfunctions, the possibility of a considerably lengthened and intensi- ﬁed photosensitization should be taken into account. 5.4.3 Immune Reactions The allergic potential of a photosensitizer depends on its basic chemical structure. The hematoporphyrins generally have such a potential, which, however, is very dependent on the method of preparation and puriﬁcation. Modern preparations, such as dihematoporphyrin ether (DHE: Photofrin II\u0003) or hematoporphyrin deri- vate (HpD), have such a high degree of purity that reports about allergic reactions represent the exception. HpD has, for instance, been added in signiﬁcant con- centrations to several geriatric compounds for many years. This naturally repre- sents a potential risk of photosensitization that has hardly been considered, but there has as yet been no notable number of accounts concerning allergic incidents. 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 105 5.4.4 Temperature and Pain Management Due to the normally low power density in principle during PDT no rise in tem- perature happens (Fig. 5.11). But for deeper reaction depth a higher power density (photon ﬂux) at the surface is necessary. This can cause a power density above 300 mW/cm 2 at which an overheating can happen. To reduce this effect a surface cooling either with cold air or ice cube is necessary. But another situation even needs surface cooling: In ALA-PDT there is a burning sensation which is not related to an increasing temperature. This is caused by direct activation of PPIX in the C nerve ﬁbers [3]. This mimics burning without any high temperature. This effect will be enhanced due to the fact that for instance in Basalioma the content in C-nerve ﬁbers is greater than in normal skin (Fig. 5.12). This can be detected even in diagnostic ALA-ﬂuorescence [4]. To overcome this effect even a cold air cooling is useful but here not to cool down an overheating but to depolarize the nerve ﬁbers so they cannot react to the Laser irradiation. But this works not in all patients so sometimes regional anes- thesia (local inﬁltration is without any effect!) or general anesthesia is necessary. But also some systemic photosensitizers can cause severe pain. The HpD is painless, but some photosensitizers in the family of Chlorins induce severe pain also in endoscopic and interstitial therapy. The effect is not yet clear but all they have a higher penetration depth (Fig. 5.13)[5]. 5.5 Clinical Indications The indication in treatment of solid tumors is mainly under palliative aspects in surgical primarily not resectable tumors or local recurrences and metastasis without any other therapeutical option like chemotherapy or radiotherapy [16, 26, 27] (Fig. 5.14). The reason is that with a surgical R0-resection in nearly all tumor entities the best 5y-life rates are obtainable. But in this tumor surgery another indication of PDT comes more important. After R0-resection direct intraoperative a PDT is performed to irradiate the tumor bed to increase the primary radicality without unnecessary defects. So the intention is similar to the intraoperative radi- ation. But one problem is the photosensitivity of the tissue to the operation or endoscopic light source. This is the reason that today only in neurosurgery the intraoperative ALA-PDT is routine. But with increasing of patients with Human Papilloma Virus infections the virus induced dysplasias, e.g., in anogenital and ENT-regions increases. An early detec- tion before an invasion starts is necessary (Fig. 5.15). One has to remember that dyplasias are a chronical disease. So we cannot prevent all the times recurrences. But we have to prevent the transition from a non-inﬁltrating dysplasia to an early invasive cancer [23]. Here, PDT is a curative tool for these diseases, e.g., because PDT is repeatable without any risk of resistance against this therapy. And with 106 H.-P. Berlien Fig. 5.11 Intraoperative temperature control with thermography. No rise in temperature is detected 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 107 increasing success in research of multiphoton ﬂuorescence, Raman spectroscopy and OCT particularly in endoscopy these lesions and an invasion can be detect early [15, 28, 32, 34].

Berlien But with photosensitizers with increasing remaining in the vascular systems more benign indications start. The latest but now the major indication is at this time the age-related macula degeneration. Due to the fact that the used BPD has normally a good penetration into tissue and a low intravascular remaining potential Fig. 5.14 relative clinical importance of PDT Melanoma akt.Ker. IIIakt.Ker.

(risik factor) OES-Ca Barret- Mucosa Metaplasia Reflux Fig. 5.15 Precancerous diseases and diseases with higher risk of malignancy 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 109 here a capsulation with liposomes are necessary. Because this coupling is in the blood not stable, within few minutes after application the Laser activation is necessary to avoid damage of the retinal epithelium. Longer experiments started in the treatments of congenital vascular tumors like infantile hemangioma and in vascular malformation especially port wine stains. But even after more than 20 years research we are at this ﬁeld before a broad application. The same is in the treatment of inﬂammatory skin diseases. The psoriasis was one of the oldest application for PDT in non-malignant diseases but could not come to routine. At this time the most ﬁeld of clinical research is now the treatment of severe acne. But comparative studies did show either severe skin photosensitivity which strained the patients more than the disease. In combination with pulsed Dye-Laser the additional effect to Laser alone is minor so at this time it is not clear if PDT will have a real success for this indication. In treatment of warts and condylomatas without dys- plasias the PDT for virus eradication could not show any success. This is easy to explain the metabolism and proliferation in warts and non-dysplastic condylomas is better than in the surrounding tissue so no speciﬁc effect can happen. But has the cell itself change to dysplasia the PDT again is the tool of choice (Fig. 5.16). 5.6 Irradiation Protocol Besides the right choice of the best Photosensitizer (e.g., topical/systemic, lipo-/ hydrophilic, long-acting/short acting) and right choice of light source much more important is the irradiation protocol (Fig. 5.17). Here, we have to calculate sep- arately the Laser parameters power, beam diameter, irradiation duration, further- more irradiation at which time after ps-adminisration, total dosis, and sequence. In general one can say: The thicker the tumor—the higher the power density—possibly with shorter irradiation time – depending by the total volume Fig. 5.16 Therapy modalities in laser tumor therapy 110 H.-P. Berlien The more superﬁcial—the lower the power density—possibly with longer irradiation time – depending by the total volume Even the cooling inﬂuences not only the pain sensation and/or thermal side effects but also the ROS-production. Due to the capillary spasm by cooling the microcirculation is in the overlying tissue reduced which causes a lower oxygen concentration with lower singlet oxygen production. But on the other hand we know that a lower oxygen concentration due to reduced microcirculation can produce –OH radicals. Another aspect is the beam diameter. At lower power density at the edges there is the risk that not enough singlet oxygen for cell death is produced so there is the risk of remaining tumor cells. So it is important even with ‘‘Microlens’’ irradiation to calculate the beam diameter greater than the lesion and cover the surrounding tissue with aluminum foil or zinc ointment to protect against unwanted irradiation. This means that an irradiation system Laser or diode-lamps need a reserve capacity. For the daily clinical process the following PDT-protocols [35] have been shown useful: 5.6.1 Conventional This is the most used protocol in PDT and for the majority of indications suitable (Fig. 5.18). Fig. 5.17 Excel calculation sheet for multiple lesions 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 111 One Drug—one wavelength—one irradiation The requirements for this procedure are: • high speciﬁc PS accumulation • tumor thickness in the region of penetration depth The aim for the patient is: • easy handling • treatment of large areas in one session But this procedure has some disadvantages: • long sessions • sometimes pain full In actinic keratosis, superﬁcial basalioma and Bowens disease without risk of Bowen carcinoma procedure is the therapy of choice and can be combined intraoperative with surgical techniques like CO2-Laser vaporization 5.6.2 Recovery This protocol is, e.g., for topical ALA-preparations where after a delay time new PPIX is produced in the dysplastic cells. One Drug—one wavelength—two/m irradiations The requirements for this procedure are: • active or passive late accumulation The aim for the patient is: Fig. 5.18 Conventional protocol 112 H.-P. Berlien • detection of remaining tumor cells • supra selective destruction • lower risk of overdosage But this procedure has some disadvantages: • multiple sessions • reliable patients In the meantime the patient has to be protected against artiﬁcial or sunlight and on the next morning a spetroscopie is necessary to count the amount of new PPIX- concentration 5.6.3 Fractionated For this protocol there are two indications: One is the situation of microcirculation which not allows to irradiate in one session (Fig. 5.19). But another indication can be the patient itself. In very old and/or reduced patents make sometime sense to divide the irradiation on two sessions for recovery of the patient Fig. 5.19 Fractionated protocol. In the Laser Doppler investigation there is reduction of the microcirculation so the irradiation is stopped to avoid necrosis. After 24 h normalization occurs and the second pass happened 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 113 One Drug—one wavelength—two/m irradiations The requirements for this procedure are: • long interacting PS • deﬁned PS metabolism The aim for the patient is: • reduced risk of massive tissue necrosis (in the ﬁrst pass) • deeper penetration by reduced shielding (following passes) • reduced risk of low dose PDT But this procedure has some disadvantages: • multiple sessions • reliable patient 5.6.4 Boostering This protocol has particularly advantages in disseminated and/or deeper lesion like recurrences and metastases (Fig. 5.20). Two aspects are important: One is that PS-concentration in the overlying tissue like metastases shields the deeper parts of the tumor so it cannot be treated in one session. The other aspect is that remain tumor cells in the surrounding where treated before they growth to new metastases. One Drug—one wavelength—two/m cycles The requirements for this procedure are: Fig. 5.20 Boostering protocol. The second turn was performed approximately 3 month later 114 H.-P. Berlien • deﬁned PS metabolism • no undetected PS surplus The aim for the patient is: • enhanced destruction of remaining tumor cells • preserving of tissue in between But this procedure has some disadvantages: • strong protocol • long skin photo senzitation time 5.6.5 Piggy-Back This protocol is especially important in endoscopy where tissue cannot protect against unwanted irradiation but tumor cells are in different tissues. Here, one can use the different penetration depth of different wavelength, so with the longer wavelength a direct irradiation of visible parts is possible without the risk of unattended irradiation of the underlying muscle for instance and with the shorter wavelength a full space irradiation can be performed One Drug—two wavelengths—one irradiation The requirements for this procedure are: • two absorption max for Quantum yield • relevant wl in different tumor thickness The aim for the patient is: • complete destruction of superﬁcial and deeper tumor cells in one session • preserving unaffected soft tissue, e.g., musculature But this procedure has some disadvantages: • high technical infrastructure required • speciﬁc Laser safety measurements 5.6.6 Sandwich This protocol uses the fact that pharmacologic different PS have the same acti- vation wavelength. So in one session, for instance, a topical PS like ALA for dysplasia and a systemic PS for early invasive carcinoma can be used simulta- neously. This is particularly helpful in diseases where clinically a discrimination is not easily possible. Here, the substances ﬁnd speciﬁcally their target. Two drugs—one wavelength—one irradiation The requirements for this procedure are: 5 Implementation of Laser Technologies 115 • speciﬁc enrichment for each PS • no photon or oxygen quenching The aim for the patient is: • simultaneous irradiation of intraepithelial dysplastic cells and • solid tumor with stroma and vascularization But this procedure has some disadvantages: • exact planning for systemic drug delivery and topical application • sometimes only under general anesthesia due to pain 5.7 Conclusion PDT is a clinical procedure which follows all medical requirements for any other medical procedure: It needs a strong indication It needs a patient adjusted protocol and It needs an intraoperative control and if necessary intraoperative changing of the procedure.

Berlien Chapter 6 Photochemical Internalization: A Novel Technology for Targeted Macromolecule Therapy Kristian Berg, Anette Weyergang, Marie Vikdal, Ole-Jacob Norum and Pål Kristian Selbo Abstract Photochemical internalization (PCI) is a novel technology for release of endocytosed macromolecules into the cytosol. The technology is based on the use of photosensitizers located in endocytic vesicles that upon activation by light induces a release of macromolecules from their compartmentalization in endocytic vesicles. PCI has been shown to enhance the biological activity of a large variety of macromolecules and other molecules that do not readily penetrate the plasma membrane, including type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), gene-encoding plasmids, adenovirus, oligonucleotides, and the chemotherapeuticum bleomycin. PCI has also been shown to enhance the treatment effect of targeted therapeutic macromolecules. The results show that PCI can induce efﬁcient light-directed delivery of macromolecules into the cytosol, indicating that PCI may have a variety of useful applications for site-speciﬁc drug delivery, e.g., in gene therapy, vaccination, and cancer treatment. Our studies also indicate that PCI of bleomycin is superior to PDT in targeting the tumor periphery and that this is partly the cause of the improved treatment effect of PCI as compared to PDT. K.

Recent advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have made it possible to improve targeting and design of cytotoxic agents, DNA complexes, and other macromolecules for clinical applications. To achieve the expected biological effect of these macro- molecules, in many cases, internalization to the cell cytosol is crucial. Macro- molecules are frequently prohibited from penetrating cell membranes, are instead, endocytosed and without any active intervention become degraded by hydrolytic enzymes in the lysosomes. Thus, at an intracellular level, the most fundamental obstruction for cytosolic localization of therapeutic macromolecules is the mem- brane-barrier of the endocytic vesicles [1]. Photochemical internalization (PCI) is a novel technology for release of endocytosed macromolecules into the cytosol. PCI has been shown to potentiate the biological activity of a large variety of macro- molecules and other molecules that do not readily penetrate the plasma membrane [2, 3]. PCI may be utilized for treatment of most solid tumors and the ﬁrst phase I clinical trial with PCI of bleomycin [4] for several cancer indications, including SCC of the Head and Neck, sarcomas, and breast carcinoma metastasis to the skin, have recently been completed with encouraging results (unpublished data). In many cancers, local recurrence (LR) is almost inevitable and no efﬁcient local cure is available, e.g., malignant brain tumors and malignant pleural meso- thelioma. PDT and PCI may be used for local as well as systemic control of cancer. Here, the principle of PCI using PCI of immunotoxins as examples and their impact on invasive cancer, the tumor vasculature and antitumor immunity will be discussed. 6.2 Background Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising modality (4) approved for cancer treatment (mainly skin (basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and AK), lung, esophagus, and bladder) world-wide. PDT is based upon light activation of a compound, named photosensitizer (PS), which has a preferential retention in tumor tissues. Light exposure of the photosensitizers with visible light generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), where singlet oxygen is considered as the most important, and thereby induces cytotoxic effects in the light exposed area (Fig. 6.1). PSs have no side effect in the absence of light. PDT-induced cellular damage is dependent on the physico-chemical properties of the photosensitizer. It is well-known that upon administration some photosensitizers localize to the endosomes and lysosomes of the cell. Light exposure of some of these photosensitizers (such as TPPS2a, TPCS2a (Amphinex\u0003), and AlPcS2a) has been shown to damage the membrane of the endocytic vesicles without inducing severe cytotoxicity [5, 6]. This is in contrast to 120 K. Berg et al. other methods developed to induce endo-lysosomal damage, where the treatment is cytotoxic or exert low efﬁcacy and/or speciﬁcity. Although a molecule is unable to penetrate the plasma membrane, it is still taken up into the cell by means of endocytosis, either by receptor-mediated or adsorptive endocytosis or by pinocytosis. Endocytosed molecules are further transported to late endosomes and lysosomes where they are degraded. Drugs, with intracellular targets, that are not able to penetrate the plasma membrane will be degraded in the endocytic vesicles and will not exert any therapeutic effects. As described above, PDT with selected PSs has been shown to damage the endo- lysosomal membrane without inducing severe cytotoxicity and may therefore be utilized for cytosolic release of endocytosed drugs before they are degraded (Fig. 6.2). This method, Photochemical internalization (PCI) has been shown to increase the effect of ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) toxins from plants, im- munotoxins, genes (in both plasmids and viruses), peptide nucleic acids (PNA), siRNA, peptides (for vaccination), doxorubicin, and bleomycin [3]. Experiments have been performed in many cell lines ([80) and 10 tumor models derived from all major cancers and shown to exert a synergistic effect in all cases. The results show that PCI can induce efﬁcient light-directed delivery of macromolecules into the cytosol, indicating that PCI may have a variety of useful applications for site- speciﬁc drug delivery, e.g., in gene therapy, vaccination, and cancer treatment. Although the PCI technology has been developed for intracellular delivery of therapeutic macromolecules some chemotherapeutic agents accumulate in endo- cytic vesicles probably due to their size and/or charge. Bleomycin is a highly used chemotherapeutic agents for several cancer indications, but is also known for accumulating in endocytic vesicles [7]. The therapeutic effect of bleomycin is limited and lung ﬁbrosis is a severe side effect frequently observed after accu- mulated doses bleomycin. However, after entering the cytosol bleomycin has been found highly cytotoxic and it has been estimated that only approximately 500 molecules is sufﬁcient to kill a cell [8, 9]. PCI of bleomycin has been shown to improve the cytotoxic effect of bleomycin both in vitro and in vivo [4] and used in Fig. 6.1 Schematic description of the treatment procedure for PDT is also utilized by PCI. In the clinical PCI procedure today bleomycin is injected prior to the light exposure 6 Photochemical Internalization 121 a phase I clinical trial that showed promising results. A beneﬁt might be a reduced adverse effect of PCI of such chemotherapeutic agents if the therapeutic window can be increase and lower doses of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics can be adminis- trated. In the clinical trial bleomycin was injected only once with a standard bleomycin dose. 6.3 PCI of Ribosome-Inactivation Protein Toxins and Immunotoxins as an Example of Therapeutic Macromoleculesfor Potential Clinical Use A variety of plant RIPs have been shown to enzymatically inhibit ribosomal activity and are therefore highly cytotoxic to mammalian cells. These RIPs are endocytosed, but only a small fraction (5 % less) of molecules are successfully translocated through the Golgi apparatus to the cytosol where the toxins inhibit ribosomal protein synthesis eventually killing the cell. PCI may be used to increase both the efﬁcacy and speciﬁcity of these toxins. There are two groups of RIPs, type I and type II. Type II RIPs, like ricin, consist of 2 polypeptide chains, one cyto- toxic A-chain with N-glycosidase activity and one B-chain which binds to the cell surface. Type I RIPs, like gelonin, agrostin, and saporin, lack the B-chain and are Plasma membran PCI of a drug Cytosol Lysosome Endosome Extracelular matrix D D D D D D D P P P P P P P P P P P Light PCIDD D Drug Photosensitizer P P P P P P P D D D Fig. 6.2 Schematic description of the PCI technology 122 K. Berg et al. therefore poorly taken up and translocated to the cell cytosol. Hence, the cytotoxic effect of these protein toxins without linking any targeting moiety is absent or very low. A considerable cytotoxic effect of type I RIPs has been shown in combination with PCI, both in vitro and in vivo [10]. The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been a revolution in cancer treatment, and several mAbs are today approved for clinical use. Treatment resistance is often a problem in mAbs-treatment. The drug response can, however, be increased by binding the mAbs to cytotoxic compounds, such as protein toxins, forming immunotoxins (ITs). The historical problems with ﬁrst and second gen- eration ITs are largely solved by the use of recombinant DNA technology where chimeric proteins consisting of the fv-fragment of an antibody and a protein toxin are constructed [11]. Antibodies or antibody fragments can be replaced with other targeting molecules like cytokines or growth-factors (e.g., IL-2, EGF, and VEGF). One of the advantages of using RIP-based ITs in cancer treatment is that these molecules are highly toxic when they enter the cytosol of the cell. It is estimated that as few as 1-10 RIP molecules in the cytosol is sufﬁcient to kill a cell. However, there are some disadvantages of using protein toxins for the treatment of solid tumors, such as (1) limited penetration through the malignant tissue; (2) expression of neutralizing antibodies due to repeated injections of the IT; (3) uptake of the IT in normal cells causing side effects such as vascular leak syn- drome (VLS), hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and damage on other organs which express the target-antigen on the cell surface. Since RIP-based ITs are unable to penetrate the membranes of endocytic vesicles, targeting fusion toxins based on type I RIPs are thought to induce less side effects than type II based ITs. PCI, as described below, can be used to activate type I RIP-based ITs by a photochemical release of the protein toxin into the cytosol of a cell. This activity is induced only in the tissue that is exposed to light and consequently, the dose limiting adverse effects of the IT is highly reduced. Recently, we demonstrated that PCI of the melanoma targeting fusion toxin MELscFv-rGel strongly augmented the thera- peutic effect of MELsvFc-Gel in vitro and synergistic effects were also achieved in vivo [12]. This is the ﬁrst in vivo study that documents therapeutic effects of PCI of a targeting macromolecule after systemic administration. Of particular interest, compared to other studies where ITs are injected multiple times, the IT was administered only once in this study. 6.4 Impact of PCI on the Tumor Cells, the Vasculature, and the Immune System PDT is known for exerting its effect through targeting the parenchyma (tumor cells), the vasculature, and the immune system (Fig. 6.3). An in vivo-ex vivo assay has shown that PCI of bleomycin may target both the tumor cells and the vas- culature (unpublished results). 6 Photochemical Internalization 123 6.4.1 PCI: Therapeutic Effects on Invasive Cancers The inﬁltrative growth of many cancers frequently results in local recurrences (LRs) as well as metastasis and is therefore a major challenge in cancer treatment. The rates of LR and metastasis vary from cancer to cancer and are in general dependent on the pathological anatomical diagnosis and local anatomical con- siderations [13]. PDT is currently under clinical investigation as an adjuvant to surgery when a safe surgical resection margin cannot be obtained. However, although increased survival time has been observed by PDT performed on the surgical cavity local recurrences are frequently observed. Our recent results with an invasive tumor model in athymic mice indicate that this is due to resistance of the transitional zone (periphery) of the tumor to PDT, while PCI is much more efﬁcient in eradicating this zone [14]. This has been shown by performing PDT and PCI of BLM on the cavity after marginal surgical resection of invasive HT1080 ﬁbro- sarcoma xenografts [15]. PDT was found to be completely inactive on the residual tumor cells, while PCI strongly prevented tumor growth after surgery. 6.4.2 PCI: Vascular Targeting The treatment effect of PCI in vivo has until recently been assumed to be due to targeting of the tumor parenchyma cells and that the enhanced therapeutic effect as compared to PDT to be due to induction of necrosis in deeper tissue layer than by . However, our recent results utilizing the invasive HT1080 ﬁbrosarcoma model indicate that the PS AlPcS2a is also localized in the endothelial lining of the vasculature and most likely is the cause of the vascular shutdown observed shortly (2 h) after light exposure (from Gd-DPMA based MRI) [15]. The vascular shut- down was complete, except for the tumor periphery that appeared unaffected. There were no differences between PDT and PCI of bleomycin in this respect. Fig. 6.3 Schematic description of PDT and the main therapeutic effects. The PS associates with the target tissue, e.g., tumor, and upon exposure to light absorbed by the PS induces several therapeutic effects 124 K. Berg et al. However, bleomycin is a slow acting chemotherapeuticum and is not expected to exert any therapeutic effect shortly after administration. It has recently been shown by an in vivo-ex vivo assay that the vasculature in the periphery is also targeting by PCI of bleomycin (unpublished data). PCI may, therefore, on this basis be used to target both the tumor parenchyma cells as well as the vasculature of the tumor. A large number of clinical anti-angiogenesis studies have been established for the therapy of cancer. Proteins important for the regulation of angiogenesis include vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), FGF, TNF-a, EGF, HIF-1a, and IL-8. VEGF-A is one of the major mediators in tumor angiogenesis and binds the receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 on vascular endothelial cells. VEGFR-2 is presumed to be the most important receptor mediating the proangiogenetic effects of VEGF in solid tumors. Several types of drugs (tyrosin kinases, siRNA, Mabs, and soluble receptors) targeting the VEGFR-2 or downstream signaling pathways are under development for clinical use. A fusion protein consisting of VEGF-A (isoform VEGF121) and recombinant gelonin, VEGF121-rGel has been shown to induce cytotoxic effects on cells expressing VEGFR-2 [16]. The therapeutic effect of VEGF121-rGel is, however, limited by toxicity to normal cells. PCI should therefore be a proper approach to strengthen the therapeutic effect and speciﬁcity of VEGF121-rGel-based therapy. Recent studies indicate that PCI of VEGF121- rGel on VEGFR2 stably transfected PAE endothelial cells (KDR cells) induces a strong synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro (unpublished data). 6.4.3 Antitumor Immunity by PDT and PCI A signiﬁcant increase in the inﬁltration of CD8+-T cells is reported in the tumor of PDT responsive patients compared to patients that to not respond to the treatment [17]. In addition, preclinical studies demonstrate that PDT induces inﬂammatory and immunologic responses. PDT leads to an immediate accumulation of neutro- phils in the affected tissue followed by an increase of mast cells and monocytes that have implications for the treatment effect. Preclinical reports also indicate that PDT may have a vaccinating effect [18]. We have therefore initiated a study to explore vaccinating effects of PDT and PCI using a CT26.CT25 mouse colon carcinoma xenograft model growing subcutaneously in athymic and thymic mice. Our data show that no tumors grow upon reinjections of tumor cells in thymic mice 0- 2 months after CR of PDT and PCI (unpublished data). This is highly encouraging and indicates antitumor immunity of therapies using PCI photosensitizers. 6.5 Conclusions PCI is highly efﬁcient in improving internalization of macromolecules. Substantial site-direction of the treatment can be obtained by the need for light activation and in some diseases, such as in solid cancers, the preferential retention of the 6 Photochemical Internalization 125 photosensitizer in the diseased areas. This dual selectivity will reduce damage of the normal surrounding tissue. An additional selectivity is obtained when the macromolecule of interest is bound to a tumor seeking ligand or antibody. Most technologies developed so far are useful for internalization of only one group of compounds, while PCI has been shown to act efﬁciently in internalization of a large variety of macromolecules and may be useful for internalization of different macromolecules simultaneously. The method can be combined with most other means for generating site- and tissue-speciﬁcity. References 1.

Philipp 7.1 Introduction Skin is the largest organ of the human body. Usually, it is easy accessible for topical application of drugs and light dosimetry is easy due to the rather ﬂat appearance in a ﬁrst approximation. On the other hand a larger number of skin diseases cover a larger area or show multifocal appearance, which favors regional or large ﬁeld therapies and impedes surgical interventions. As scar formation is another and today highly unwanted result of surgery, the widespread use of PDT in dermatology is a necessary consequence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), between two and three million people in the world develop white skin cancer (nonmelanoma skin cancer, NMSC) every year [1]. According to the German Cancer Society 120 of 100,000 inhabitants in Germany are affected yearly with NMSC. Of these, 100 cases are basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which makes it the most frequently occurring malignant skin tumor, followed by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Actinic keratosis (AK) is a premalignant lesion and can lead to SCC [2]. Historically, PDT started with dermatological application. The ﬁrst documented in the modern times treatment was done by Von Tappeiner and Jesionek who treated BCC with topically applied Eosin and light in 1904. They discovered the effect of Eosin staining and light on living cells in 1899, when they studied some protozoon species (paramecia), some were exposed to light others were not accidentally. The light exposed samples died and the concept was born. They also deﬁned the term PDT as ‘‘interaction by a ﬂuorescent dye and light and oxygen to produce a cytotoxic effect’’, which is not precise with regard to today’s knowledge, but was revolutionary at the time of the authors [3–5]. The use of psoralene containing topicals and exposure to sunlight is even much older and dates back several thousand years to the ancient history of mankind. C. M. Philipp (&) Ev.

Abdel-Kader (ed.), Photodynamic Therapy, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39629-8_7, \u0002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 131 Documented in several ancient books as the Atharavaveda (1400 BC, India) or the Papyrus Ebers (1550 BC, Egypt) it was a common treatment for vitiligo and psoriasis in India, Egypt, and Greece. Today this therapy is known as PUVA- therapy, which signiﬁcantly differs from PDT regarding the involved mechanisms but has in common that a drug is activated by light. The ﬁrst systemic application of porphyrin was described by Hausmann in 1911 who injected porphyrin into mice and Meyer-Betz who self injected hematopor- phyrin and exposed himself to light on a sun deck during a bus ride in 1912 [6, 7]. The effect was obviously a phototoxic reaction with severe swelling of light exposed skin at head and hands, which fortunately recovered after some days. The photographs of this experiment are legendary. Although topical PDT is most common today, systemic PDT plays an important role for advanced skin tumors and skin metastases, e.g., of breast cancer. 7.2 Photosensitzers for Topical PDT 7.2.1 5-ALA/PpIX The very ﬁrst attempts to topical PDT were performed by Tappeiner and his group at the Pharmacological Institute of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich between 1903 and 1905, when they used eosin, ﬂuorescein, acridine orange, and other dyes to treat ‘‘ulcus rhodens,’’ ulcerated basal cell carcinoma, and other tumors of the skin, including the problem of ‘‘lupus vulgaris’’, the cutaneous tuberculosis, which was of high importance at that time [8, 9]. The application was usually topical, but also injection of the dyes into the tumors was reported for sensitization and irradiation with artiﬁcial light from an arc lamp was used. Today dyes as methylene-blue, toluidine-blue-O, and indo- cyanine green are in the focus of research e.g., for applications in dental medicine (periodontal diseases) as they act as bactericide disinfectant when used in com- bination with light. Penetration of those rather small dye molecules into tissues e.g., skin with its barrier the stratum corneum is much better than of larger molecules as porphyrins which came into favor as photosensitizers for PDT after the description by Hausmann and Meyer-Betz in the early 19th century. But topical application of porphyrins failed, due to their poor penetration of the skin barrier and the topical PDT was left as a treatment modality, maybe also due to the growing possibilities of radiotherapy which dominated the nonsurgical skin tumor treatment for decades. The solution of this problem was found in 1990 by Kennedy and Pottier who demonstrated that a small molecule, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), easily pene- trates into the skin [10, 11]. 132 C. M. Philipp ALA is a precursor of heme, it is not a photosensitizer by itself but it is quickly metabolized to another precursor of heme, the protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) via the intrinsic cellular heme-biosynthetic pathway. Exogenous administration of ALA bypasses the natural regulation that heme exerts on ALA synthesis, which leads to increased production of PpIX [12]. PpIX has been found to preferentially accu- mulate in tumor as compared with normal cells. This phenomenon can be explained by differences in heme-biosynthetic pathway between nonmalignant and malignant cells. It has been shown that decreased activity of ferrochelatase [13–16] and limited availability of iron [17] in tumor cells contribute to increased PpIX accumulation. Enhanced activity of enzymes leading to production of PpIX, such as ALAD, UROD, or PBGD [13, 18] has also been observed in tumor cells. PpIX is a strong photosensitizer, which assembles in mitochondria of tumor cells leading to their damage after light exposure (Fig. 7.1). Usually, about 4–6 h after administration of ALA, when PpIX has been already synthesized, target cells are exposed to light, which leads to excitation of the photosensitizer and formation of 1O2 that exerts cytotoxic effects [19, 20]. 5-Aminolevulinic acid for dermatologic applications is available in different formulations throughout the world today. Brand names are Metvix\u0003, Alacare \u0003, Alasens\u0003 Levulan\u0003 Kerastick\u0003, Ameluz\u0003 with differing concentrations and carriers.

Normally, the activity of ALAS1, is regulated by heme through the negative feedback mechanism. Normally, the feedback mechanism leads to the production of PpIX in such amounts that can be efﬁciently converted to heme by ferrochelatase. Exogenous administration of ALA bypasses the natural regulation that heme exerts on ALA synthesis, which leads to increased production of PpIX. The efﬁcacy of ferrochelatase is then too low to convert excessively produced PpIX to heme, which results in the accumulation of PpIX within cells. About 4–6 h after administration of ALA, when PpIX is already synthesized, target cells are exposed to light, which leads to excitation of the photosensitizer and formation of 1O2 that exerts cytotoxic effects [20] 7 PDT in Dermatology 133 Levulan\u0003 is also known under the name Aladerm. Alasens\u0003 is a formulation from Russia, which might be used orally or topical. All products have approval for the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (AK) grade I and II at least in the countries of origin. Metvix\u0003 additionally is approved for noninvasive superﬁcial squamous cell carcinoma (Morbus Bowen, MB), superﬁcial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) and nodular basal cell carcinoma (nBCC) in combination with prior curettage in Europe. Explicit excluded is the treatment of morpheic (morpheaform) BCC. Whether the treatment of nodular BCC with topical photosensitizers makes any sense or not should be evaluated in studies to come, today in our clinic we do not treat nodular BCC with topical PDT if they extend more than one millimeter into the skin. Reason for this limitation is not the penetration of the drug but the lack of control the tumor in its full extend with optical coherence tomography (OCT), which will be discussed later in this article. Penetration depth of the mentioned ALA formulations, e.g., Metvix\u0003, within the given times is expected to be between 2 and 3 mm in non-hyperkeratotic skin. Already to use formulations are somewhat expensive. But there is a free recipe for an ALA-thermogel by Professor Dr. Christel Müller-Goymann from the Institut für Pharmazeutische Technologie der Universität Braunschweig available at the internet which could easily be prepared by a pharmacist and all components can be obtained by the pharmacist also [21] (Table 7.1). The components should be weighted and stirred together with 1,450 rpm in an unguator for 90 s. During the exothermic reaction a gel may be formed that becomes liquid again if cooled down below 12 \u0004C. Preferably cooled water should be used, as else the gel may becomes too sticky for stirring it properly. The preparation should be stored only shortly and always in a cold place (6–8 \u0004C) as the amino component is not stable in the dissolved form. It is possible to produce a larger amount of the base and add the active component (5-aminolevulinic acid) shortly before use. The ALA-thermogel should be applied when it is still cold and liquid. In contact with skin it turns into a gel that would not run off from the site. If you want to use this recipe please make sure not to violate possible restrictive laws regarding the use of free formulated prescription drugs in the country you are working in. In Germany, it is common to make prescriptions for topical ointments e.g., in dermatology or ENT with a composition of ingredients which is not available as a patented drug formulation. Every medical doctor can write a Table 7.1 Components of ALA-thermogel [21] Component g/100 g 5-aminolaevulinic acid 10.00 Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic\u0003 F127) 18.00 Isopropyl alcohol 11.25 Dimethylisosorbid 11.25 Medium-chain triglycerides(Miglyol\u0003 840) 4.50 Water 45.00 134 C. M. Philipp personalized prescription and if the pharmacist is able to produce it then he becomes liable for the proper composition of the drug and the MD who is using it becomes liable for its use including unwanted side effects. 7.2.2 Penetration Enhancement Compared to the large porphyrin molecules ALA is a small molecule and pene- trates skin faster and deeper. Nevertheless, the application time of a solution of ALA in water or base cream would be much longer as suggested in the fact sheets for the above-mentioned brand formulations. The bioavailability is somewhat crucial for compliance of both patients and clinician, and it is important for marketing. But a higher bioavailability also reduces unwanted side effects due to a lower concentration of the active drug necessary and a higher selectivity. Fur- thermore, during longer permeation times the active substance may be changed by polymerization or other chemical changes. All brand formulations use special pharmacological features to enhance the penetration of the skin barrier. The active ingredient of Metvix\u0003 is the methyl ester of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (MAL, MAOP). It is less polar and therefore penetrates the stratum corneum in a higher rate compared to the more hydrophilic substance. Ameluz \u0003 employs patented nanostructures to enhance the permeability of the skin. Other options to increase the permeation would be the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the base of the for- mulation. For the ALA-thermogel a 7.5-fold increase in comparison with base cream DAC, and a 19.5-fold increase compared to water containing hydrophilic ointment was described [22]. It is clinical practice to remove strong hyperkeratotic layers prior to the application of ALA. A mechanical curettage, erbium laser ablation, or fractionated techniques may be used. Forster reported a strong increase of ﬂuorescence increase and a deeper penetration of ALA after erbium laser ablation of the stratum cor- neum [23]. Less sophisticated microneedle pretreatment has shown to improve the permeability of the skin as well [24] and iontophoresis proved to be effective in increasing the transport for MAL, but both techniques increase the efforts, com- plexity and possible risks of the procedure also [25]. These attempts show that penetration of the drug and the gradient of concentration are of major concern and the limiting factor for topical PDT, as light of the usually applied wavelength for therapy (635 nm) shows a rather deep penetration into tissues and theoretically could be applied up to any total energy. 7 PDT in Dermatology 135 7.2.3 Other Topical Photosensitizers Fosgel\u0003, Foslip\u0003 and Fospeg\u0003 contain Temoporﬁn (mTHPC) a chlorin which is marketed as Foscan\u0003 for systemic applications. Fosgel\u0003/Foslip\u0003 contains mTHPC bound to conventional liposomes, Fospeg\u0003 consists of mTHPC bound to pegylated liposomes. Chlorins are potent photosensitizers, but relatively large molecules. The ﬁrst reports on Foslip\u0003 in 2006 and 2007 in animal models where promising [26, 27]. The evaluation may continues [28] but clinical studies are not reported so far and the formulation is not commercially available, yet it is not announced at the website of biolitec\u0003, the company that distributes Foscan\u0003. Another promising topical photosensitizer is indocyanine green (ICG) currently under evaluation for the treatment of periodontal diseases and acne [29, 30]. Other indications including basal cell carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma showed less favorable results compared to other photosensitizers and were left. Actually, there is no concurrent topical photosensitizer to ALA and its derivative MAL in clinical relevant use. 7.3 Systemic Photosensitizers Most of PDT applications in dermatology are based on topical application of ALA and its derivatives. This might be understandable from the dermatological view, but it is all but logical from the view of an oncologist. It is limiting PDT to benign diseases, epithelial dysplasia and very superﬁcial tumors, which should be not necessarily the limit. At a certain stage in tumor development vascular growth into and nutrition of the tumor masses becomes evident. As the amount of accumulated photosensitizer decreases with the depth in topical application critical regions may be not or insufﬁciently sensitized. In this situation, a photosensitization via a systemic route should be considered as a possible and maybe superior compared to topical application. Today, clinically relevant systemic photosensitizers are based on two substances, hematoporphyrin (HPD) or chlorin. The major disadvantage of both substances is their general photosensitization of skin after systemic admin- istration. Nevertheless, a high speciﬁc uptake ratio with an efﬁcient contrast between solid skin tumors and surrounding healthy skin can be obtained at a certain time interval, which is substance speciﬁc and ranges between hours in case of chlorine-e6 (Fotolon\u0003, not commercially available today, APOCARE Pharma) to one or two days in HPD (Photofrin\u0003, Pinnacle Biologics) and even longer in mTHPC (Foscan\u0003, Biolitec). 136 C. M. Philipp 7.4 Fluorescence Diagnostics: Clinical Aspects 7.4.1 Fluorescence Diagnostics PpIX is a strong photosensitizer but it also shows a bright red ﬂuorescence with center wavelengths of 636 and 700–710 nm when excited with blue light of usually 405 nm (380–440 nm). As it requires the presence of an added ﬂuorophore this type of ﬂuorescence is named xenoﬂuorescence in contrast to autoﬂuorescence from tissue-speciﬁc ﬂuorophores. The clinical use of PpIX-ﬂuorescence goes far beyond dermatological applications, it is used to delineate the borders of gliomas after oral uptake of Gliosan\u0003 as well as of bladder tumors after local installation of Hexvix\u0003. Special pharmacological formulations again help to allow optimized accumulation in tissue-speciﬁc tumors and surroundings. But whatever formula- tion is used, the ﬂuorescence is of PpIX and shows the characteristic red ﬂuo- rescence and all the other typical features and shortcomings, e.g., strong photobleaching and lack of discrimination power between dysplasia and inﬂam- mation. Usually, a two-dimensional image is generated by excitation with a blue light source and applicable ﬁlters for endoscopes or cameras or simply goggles that cut off the blue light to enhance the visual effect. The ﬁrst commercially available system was the D-light\u0003-system by Storz for use in urology. Today numerous systems exist, each with special features for its speciﬁc use. In endoscopy, e.g., for imaging of bronchial dysplasias, the comparison of the autoﬂuorescence and xenoﬂuorescence images is often use to overcome the shortcomings of PpIX- ﬂuorescence imaging. All of the endoscopic systems may be used in dermatology, but excitation is also possible with a woodlight lamp. For documentation a usual CCD or CMOS camera equipped with a cut off ﬁlter for blue light (for example: HOYA, K2 yellow) is applicable (Figs. 7.2, 7.3). Fig. 7.2 PPIX-ﬂuorescence in sBCC (D-light). Image of a typical PpIX-ﬂuorescence in a superﬁcial BCC, as the lesion is clearly demarcated the ﬂuorescence is sharp 7 PDT in Dermatology 137 7.4.1.1 In motley pictures little clarity, much error and a grain of truth… (Goethe, Faust I) The problem with image reception is their powerful reﬂection in our brains. As clinicians we believe what we see, and very often we do not think about the real signiﬁcance of those impressive images. To interpret those images of ﬂuorescence properly, we have to recognize three basic truths: 1. Excitation with blue light always affects only the very superﬁcial layers in depths that range rather in micrometers than in millimeters. 2. Our eyes are not made for an objective assessment as they enhance low intensities in recognition and have only weak discrimination ability for high intensities above a certain level in order to maximize the information. 3. Our eyes are usually not able to discriminate a red of 636 nm from 670 nm and visual recognition underlies numerous inter individual differences. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to judge if ﬂuorescence is weak or strong by the visual aspect. Neither it is possible to decide if the particular ﬂuorescence we see is of PpIX or another substance. Camera systems, e.g., of specially designed ﬂuo- rescence cameras make things usually even worse, as they are constructed (built) to enhance weak signals and the colors of a display usually cannot be trusted. Finally, there is only one message left that could be stated if we see the ‘‘red’’: There is any red ﬂuorescence at the surface. One possible option to increase the contrast is to expose the sensitized region to a small amount of light (even white light). Photobleaching of PpIX will lead to a decay of the signal and superﬁcially ﬂuorescence will be wiped out, while higher concentrations of PpIX remain to discriminate more severe lesions with higher grades of dysplasia. But care has to be taken, that photobleaching does not wipe out all the ﬂuorescence. Overall, it is not a signiﬁcant and reproducible option. Another way is to use a calibrated ﬁber spectroscopic system with integrated excitation and detection ﬁbers and map the region of interest. If application of Fig. 7.3 PPIX-ﬂuorescence in AK (D-light). Image of a typical PpIX-ﬂuorescence in actinic keratosis, as often the AK is situated in a region of more or less solar damaged skin, the whole area displays a strong signal 138 C. M. Philipp ALA is standardized with regard to cleaning of the region, removal of hyperker- atosis, amount of substance per area, time of incubation, and parasitic light pro- tection, the intensity of the resulting peak correlates with the content of PpIX and therefore allows relative measurements of PpIX amount in tissues. It also allows discrimination between red ﬂuorescence from PpIX and other ﬂuorophores, which might occur after ALA application (Figs. 7.4, 7.5, 7.6). The typical curve changes during the irradiation, the typical peaks decreases in correlation with the delivered amount of photons/energy due to the photobleaching effect and a new peak occurring at 670 nm which indicates the production of photoproducts of PpIX, e.g., photoprotoporphyrin (PPP) (Fig. 7.7). 7.4.2 Recovery Fluorescence In some cases (usually deeper lesion, e.g. BCC) a secondary increase of the PpIX- signal at 636 nm is detected after 24 h when the lesion was covered with light protection shields in the meantime but without further application of ALA (Fig. 7.8) and corresponding ﬂuorescence images after photosensitization, after irradiation and after 24 h (Fig. 7.9a–c). Fig. 7.4 Fluorescence from native healthy skin (autoﬂuorescence). The curve resembles different parts of ﬂuorescence, in the blue to yellow range usually some autoﬂuorescence (ﬂavins, NaDH) is detected, while in the red region ﬂuorescence is weak. If there would be any signiﬁcant ﬂuorescence in the red, it could be due to a hidden porphyria of the patient 7 PDT in Dermatology 139 The generation of photoproducts in ALA-PDT is well-known [31–34]. Usually, the major components are photoprotoporphyrin (PPP) and other chlorins, which are responsible for the shifts of the typical ﬂuorescence peaks from 636 and 700–710 to 670 nm (Fig. 7.7). Thus, the ﬁnding of a recovery ﬂuorescence at 636 nm after 24 h may suggest: (a) an excess amount of ALA in the NMSC lesions and surrounding tissues, (b) a deeper penetration of ALA with extended incubation times, (c) a local persistence of viable cells, able to continue the pro- duction of PpIX after ﬁrst irradiation. Excess amount of the precursor drug aminolevulinic acid is an intended safety measure. It is common to apply much higher amounts of the prodrug as possibly needed, to ensure a sufﬁcient supply and therefore a sufﬁcient generation of the active photosensitizer PpIX. The formulation we have used contained 20 % 5- ALA in Tylose\u0003 gel, 10 % 5-ALA in the ALA-Thermogel and the ready to use formulation Metvix\u0003 contains 16 % methylated ALA on a cream base. A well-known microscopic technique (ﬂuorescence recovery after photoble- aching, FRAP) uses the ﬂuorescence recovery to measure the lateral diffusion properties of various membrane or cytoplasmic constituents [35]. The kinetic of ﬂuorescence re-appearance was experimentally used to study the diffusion of methylated ALA and PpIX [36]. Usually, penetration of a drug into skin follows gradient concentrations and time is an important factor for deeper penetration. Fig. 7.5 Fluorescence from ALA incubated healthy skin after 6 h application time. The curve resembles different parts of ﬂuorescence, in the blue to yellow range usually some autoﬂuores- cence (ﬂavins, NaDH) is detected, while in the red region ﬂuorescence is weak. Usually, the curve is comparable with the curve of native skin, some small peak at 636 nm may be visible, e.g., shortly after ALA removal and prolonged application time (as here) 140 C. M. Philipp Excess presence of 5-ALA in the region, in and around the lesion to be treated, may allow a transport (active or passive) toward the diseased cells after primary consumption by the production of PpIX during the incubation time and consec- utive photobleaching during the ﬁrst irradiation. During photobleaching, the gra- dient of concentrations of 5-ALA between the surrounding tissue, acting as reservoirs, and the lesion increases and another transport of 5-ALA is started. Else it may be discussed, if PpIX produced in the surrounding tissues may be trans- ported by diffusion to the lesions. But usually, we found a sharp demarcation with blue-red contrast between lesions and surroundings in the 2D-ﬂuorescence control by means of D-Light system, indicating low PpIX-levels in the surroundings 24 h after the ﬁrst irradiation. If some cells, e.g., in deeper layers of the lesion [37] may not have received lethal doses of drug or light at time of the ﬁrst PDT, these cells bear the risk of a recurrence of the lesion. This requires high attention as it is clinically not acceptable. Remnant cells may continue further PpIX generation or accumulation if ALA or PpIX is or become available. Hence, repeated light exposures should increase the efﬁcacy of ALA-PDT [38]. Bacteria are always present in human skin. They may offer different pathways for the generation of ﬂuorescent derivatives of ALA. Their short cell cycle and migration capabilities allow rapid (re)invasion of necrotic tissues at the lesions Fig. 7.6 Fluorescence from ALA incubated AK with typical pronounced PpIX-ﬂuorescence peaks, the curves resembles different parts of ﬂuorescence, in the blue to yellow range usually some autoﬂuorescence (ﬂavins, NaDH) is detected, while in the red region the signal of PpIX is depicted after sensitization with a dominant peak at 636 nm and a smaller peak at 700 nm. After irradiation of 60, 120, and 600 s, respectively, the peaks decrease, PpIX is bleached 7 PDT in Dermatology 141 Fig. 7.7 Fluorescence from ALA incubated AK after irradiation with decreased PpIX- ﬂuorescence peak and increase of ﬂuorescence at 670 nm indicating the production of photoproducts of PpIX, e.g., photoprotoporphyrin (PPP) Fig. 7.8 Fluorescence from ALA incubated AK after irradiation and after a time interval (24 h) while covered with light shielding dressing and ‘‘recovery’’ ﬂuorescence in the red region 142 C. M. Philipp site, even after local eradication by PDT. Water soluble porphyrins were found after irradiation of bacterial cultures incubated with ALA with a ﬂuorescence peak of 618–620 nm [39]. As this wavelength hardly can be discriminated from 636 nm by 2D ﬂuorescence imaging, it could be falsely interpreted as recovery ﬂuores- cence of PpIX if no spectral analysis is done. 7.4.3 Endpoint of Irradiation The lack of ﬂuorescence is often used as endpoint of irradiation. After all, this is not an ideal guide as the excitation with blue light does not affect the deeper layers Fig. 7.9 a–c (please mount the three images together) Fluorescent images (D-light) of a BCC- lesion, a after photosensitization, b after primary irradiation, c after 24 h with light shielding dressing. Figure 7.9a,b correspond with Fig. 7.6 (loss of ﬂuorescence during irradiation) and Fig. 7.9c corresponds with Fig. 7.8 (recovery ﬂuorescence after 24 h) 7 PDT in Dermatology 143 of the dysplastic tissues or tumors, and remaining PpIX would not be detected. Shallow bleaching could lead to an early interruption of treatment and persistence of deeper portions of the diseased tissues, which still could be sensitized. Insertion of spectroscopic ﬁbers and interstitial mapping of the PS-concentration would be an alternative but is not practicable. We use a precomputed light overdose in PpIX- PDT instead. Neither the photosensitizer (which in case of PpIX is consumed during the procedure) nor the light itself is harmful. Exposure of not sensitized volumes does not lead to additional damage and already lethally irradiated cells have to be regarded as dead. Therefore, an overdose above the decay of superﬁcial ﬂuorescence is advocated. On the other hand, if there is still ﬂuorescence detectable after the calculated and delivered dose of light, the irradiation should be continued. 7.5 Light Sources for PDT, Dosimetry There is a long discussion about the proper light sources for PDT. It is relatively easy to acknowledge that endoscopic guided and interstitial PDT requires lasers, as the transport of the light into the body is the bottleneck and this can easily be handled only with lasers. To irradiate the surface of a body one could also use tungsten ﬁlament, xenon arc, metal halide, and ﬂuorescent lamps or LED, probably OLED in the near future (Ambulight\u0003), and of course lasers. Even daylight has been successfully used in the treatment of low grade AK [40–43]. What would be the best choice then? As always, this cannot be answered ﬁnally at present and prospective and for all indications in the same way. For topical PDT in dermatology, it seems to be rather not very important which light source is used as penetration of ALA into the tissues and subsequent PpIX generation is the limiting factor. Always the total light dose should be administered in a homoge- nous fashion over the area. This is usually realized by LED-arrays (and OLED’s, organic LED) and lasers with ﬂat top proﬁle ﬁber applicator. The calculation of dose and power density is easy, as all light emitted is light of the proper wavelength (usually 635 +-5 nm for porphyrins including PpIX) and the area is described by a circle. In LED the emission range is wider but still covers the typical red absorption peak of PpIX, the irradiated area usually is larger and square. Lamps emit a rather inhomogenous spectrum of different wavelengths and only a portion is effective in PDT, consequently the total irradiation dose has to be much higher and the duration of irradiation is usually of longer duration and side effects may increase. During the lifetime of a lamp, the emission spectrum may change and repeated calibration is necessary. Additionally used ﬁlters add further problems as cooling and wear. As LEDs have become widely available, the use of lamps is decreasing. A typical LED array is Aktilite\u0003 which was designed by Photocure\u0003 for the use with Metvix \u0003 with a recommended energy density of 37 J/cm2. Next step in clinical applications is an battery powered OLED, mounted to a plaster that is applied directly on the diseased and sensitized tissues, allowing an low-power density and long exposure 144 C. M. Philipp times to achieve a total energy density of about 50 J/cm 2 (Ambulight\u0003) for self- administered light for PDT by the patient. The current state (year 2013) of development is reﬂected in a report of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [44]. During the development of modern PDT, dye lasers have played a dominant role as light sources. Only with lasers it was possible to calculate and deliver the required energy at certain wavelengths for the numerous often preclinical photo- sensitizers, each with a speciﬁc absorption peak. Those dye lasers usually were tunable, a single laser could be tuned to a requested wavelength within a certain range. Today, diode lasers with ﬁxed wavelength have totally replaced those bulky, expensive, and hard to handle devices in the clinical work. Usually, 635 nm is used with PpIX and HPD, 652 or 665 nm are used with different chlorins. As ﬁber applicators used to apply lasers may be chosen from a wide variety of emission proﬁles (ﬂat top proﬁle, cylindrical, ball shaped, interstitial, …) they can be adopted to all clinical needs of the different clinical ﬁelds of PDT. Active calculation of the irradiation parameters is necessary with lasers. Power density (PD, W/cm2) should be kept below 200 mW/cm2 as a higher PD leads to unwanted thermal effects. There is a theoretical advantage of higher power densities in deeper lesions, especially if systemic photosensitizers are used. In case of higher PD, an efﬁcient cooling of the tissues is mandatory. The dose for PpIX-PDT depends on the indi- cation and the photosensitizer and ranges between 37 and 200 J/cm2. 7.6 Treatment Protocols 7.6.1 Topical PDT with ALA Induced PpIX In our clinic, the indication for topical PDT in AK and BCC is based on routinely performed OCT investigations of the tumors. If a tumor exceeds one millimeter in thickness, we usually do not settle the indication for topical PDT, only tumors that can be imaged in full are regarded as suitable, other may be treated surgically or with systemic PDT. After careful cleaning and disinfection and removal of hyperkeratotic epithelium the baseline autoﬂuorescence of the tumor is measured using a ﬁbre spectrometer followed by the application of the prodrug. For topical PDT, we use either Metvix\u0003 or ALA-Thermogel in our clinic. A single layer of cotton compress acting as grid is used in larger areas to ensure homogenous distribution of the substance, e.g., in larger areas. The area is covered with adhesive plastic foil (TegadermTM) and a second light shielding plaster made of aluminum foil and Mepore\u0003. After usually 3 h of application time, the prodrug is removed and the light shielding dressing is replaced again for at least 1 h. During this ‘‘incubation time’’ more PpIX is produced in the tumor while surrounding skin clears from surplus PpIX; hence increasing the contrast between dysplasia or tumor and surrounding skin. Directly prior to exposure with light of 635 nm the 7 PDT in Dermatology 145 light shielding dressing is removed and PpIX-ﬂuorescence is measured, again with a ﬁber spectrometer and optionally ﬂuorescent images are taken for documentation purposes. In patients with multiple lesions, the light shielding dressing is kept in later to treat sites and only removed prior to irradiation, in order to avoid photobleaching with sub-therapeutic light doses. One of the major disadvantages of PpIX-PDT is the pain that is developing shortly after the start of irradiation. Pain reception differs inter-individually within a wide range; nevertheless, most of the patients require an analgetic treatment at least with a mild stream of cooled air. Local anesthesia without suprarenin may be used but usually regional anesthesia is more effective and is preferred also because of less local interaction with blood supply and the avoidance of increased inter- stitial pressure in the treatment region. In case the irradiation site is localized at the head, sufﬁcient eye protection with metal shields is applied; else a laser safety goggle offers safe eye protection for the patient. The required light dose is applied either with a laser (Biolitec\u0003) equipped with a ﬂat top proﬁle applicator (microlens\u0003) or the Aktilite\u0003 LED with a dosimetry according to the type of disease. After the calculated energy is delivered, PpIX- ﬂuorescence is measured again and in case of lack of ﬂuorescence the treatment is completed with a petrolatum ointment and wound dressing. In case of residual ﬂuorescence at 636 nm the irradiation is continued. Usually, we then add another 50 % of the intended light dose and measure ﬂuorescence again, and so on. Benign lesions are usually irradiated with a lower light dose, which usually is ﬁxed and remaining ﬂuorescence requires no higher doses. In critically thick lesions, e.g., in some of basal cell carcinoma and Bowens disease, we use a light shielding wound dressing after the irradiation to avoid bleaching of possible newly produced PpIX. In such lesions, we measure ﬂuo- rescence with the ﬁbre spectrometer on the next day, usually about 16–18 h after the ﬁrst exposure. In case of presence of ‘‘recovery’’ ﬂuorescence, the irradiation is repeated with the same irradiation parameters as on day one. Four to six weeks after PDT patients are called in and carefully examined clinically and by means of OCT and punch biopsy if necessary. In case of persistence of lesions a second treatment is performed. 7.6.2 PDT with Systemic Photosensitizers In some situations a systemic PDT is required. Some of the patients are referred from the tumor board after other therapeutic options (e.g., radiotherapy, surgery) have been excluded due to individual circumstances or in case of recurrences after primary ﬁrst-line treatment. Usually in such cases the intention to treat is pallia- tive, but in dermatologic indications the results may be curative. With growing experience, we have started to offer systemic PDT for dermatologic tumors with deeper portions in elective indications and if topical PDT is not suitable. 146 C. M. Philipp The patients are lab checked for porphyria and renal and liver function. At day one of the systemic photosensitization, the patients are hospitalized and receive the photosensitizer intravenously after taking spectroscopic baseline measurements from the tumor site and surrounding tissues. The choice of the photosensitizer is inﬂuenced mainly by tumor type and volume. Patient and treatment rooms are equipped with a yellow ambient light of low intensity which does not lead to skin irritation but provides enough light for orientation and even reading of books or newspapers. During the accumulation time of the photosensitizer in the tumor repeated spectroscopic measurements are performed. Typically, the peaks in the curves are less pronounced and the contrast between tumor and surrounding tissues is less compared to PpIX-sensitization. This measurements help to detect the time of maximum photosensitization of the tumor. Usually, this will be 4 h after Fotolon\u0003 or 48 h after Photofrin\u0003 administration. At appropriate time the patient is transported to the treatment room, where the irradiation site is prepared by using light shielding dressings for the surrounding tissues and a mask that leaves the irradiation site free for exposure with the laser of the speciﬁc wavelength for the photosensitizer, usually 635 nm for Photofrin\u0003 and the deeper penetrating 665 nm for Fotolon\u0003. Other irradiation wavelengths as 532 nm are possible in case a more shallow reaction is required. Further detailed information about possible wavelengths and wavelength combinations, as well as differentiated irradiation protocols may be found in the chapter: ‘‘Implementation of Laser Technologies in Clinical PDT’’. In treatment with Fotolon\u0003 the total dose is delivered in one treatment session; Photofrin\u0003 allows a second irradiation after 24 h if necessary or planned, as the clearance from tumor and patient is much slower compared to Fotolon\u0003. In general, the light dosimetry in systemic PDT is more important for the result/side effect ratio as compared with topical PDT where an overexposure is nearly not possible, whereas a light overdose in systemic PDT may lead to increased side effects on surrounding tissues. The required type of anesthesia is more depending on the tumor and tumor site as on the photosensitizer, ranging from none to general anesthesia. After the calculated light dose is delivered the patient is brought to his room at the ward and stays there for the time necessary to diminish the photosensitization of the skin. During this time (usually two days in Fotolon\u0003 and three to four days in Photo- frin\u0003), spectroscopic readings are performed at usually light exposed sites (fore- head) and sites usually shielded from light (inside upper arm) to detect the appropriate time for discharge from the hospital. Careful instruction of the patient regarding light protection is mandatory. The time and extend of post-PDT light protection may vary with regard to the photosensitizer applied. 7 PDT in Dermatology 147 7.7 Indications/Limitations 7.7.1 Premalignant and Malignant Lesions 7.7.1.1 Actinic Keratosis The majority of topical PDT is applied in actinic keratosis. Another treatment option is cryotherapy. In a number of studies, the results of both treatment options are compared with the result of comparable clearing rates at a high level (80–90 %) but a better esthetic result in PDT [45–49]. Compared to Imiquimod a higher cure rate in grade II lesions was found [50], and Topical PDT has been reported to be equally effective in transplant recipients [51]. The most frequent side effect except burning pain sensation was temporary hyper-pigmentation. Erythema, skin edema, crusting, and exfoliation should not be regarded as side effects they rather have to be seen as intended effects of the treatment. The pain related to irradiation is reported to be stronger with higher power density. 7.7.2 Bowens Disease (Morbus Bowen, Intraepithelial Squamous Cell Carcinoma) In Bowen’s disease, the SCC is present within the epidermis and has not breached the basement membrane. If left untreated, the disease can invade the dermis (invasive SCC) and there is then the potential of metastases. Approximately 3 % of cases will develop into invasive disease [52]. Treatment options include sur- gery, cryotherapy, curettage, radiotherapy, and topical therapies using 5-FU or imiquimod. In a long-term follow-up comparison of topical PDT with cryotherapy and 5-FU treatment a signiﬁcant better result was found in the PDT-group with 68 % complete response rate after 2 years and 82 % after 1 year [53]. Less favorable results with a higher relapse rate over the time were reported in 2012 for the treatment of high grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) with systemic PDT [54]. This is in concordance with own observations, but must be seen with regard to the background of the usually HPV-related development of AIN and of a high co-infection rate of these patients with HIV. 7.7.3 Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, predominantly located in the head and neck areas indicating a strong correlation with excessive UV exposure. BCC is generally slow growing and locally invasive and may take a variety of clinical appearances such as nodular, cystic, superﬁcial, morpheic, ulcerated, 148 C. M. Philipp or pigmented. Treatment options for BCC include surgical excision, curettage, cryosurgery, surgical laser, radiotherapy, imiquimod, topical 5-FU, and PDT. In superﬁcial BCC, an almost complete response to PDT is reported by nearly all authors. A better esthetic outcome is uniformly observed in PDT, when com- pared with surgery or cryotherapy [55]. In nodular BCC, the data for primary complete response are in favor for surgery. Also the long-term recurrence rate seems to be higher (14 %) in topical PDT, even if primary curettage is employed [56]. Some authors found comparable results between PDT with fractionated irradiation and surgery [57]. Effects and side effects are comparable to treatment of AK, nevertheless the BCC lesions are usually smaller and show a sharper demarcation as AK which is often composed by different grade lesions with generalized actinic changes of the surrounding skin. A sustained cure rate between 87 and 94 % depending on photosensitizer dose and irradiation protocol was reported by Betz et al. after PDT with low to regular drug dose PDT with systemic Foscan\u0003-PDT and a mean follow-up of 42 months in 117 patients with 460 lesions. Besides the variations in the study on drug dose, total ﬂuence of light delivered, drug-light interval the higher recurrence rates were seen in recurrent BCCs [58]. 7.7.4 Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTLC, Mucoisis Funguides) Several investigations have appraised PpIX-PDT as a prospective modality for CTCL. Its beneﬁt for CTCL is considerably modest, and it is generally reserved as forth-line therapy. While PDT is efﬁcient for patch/plaque stage of MF, PpIX-PDT is not useful for the tumor stage of CTCL, due to insufﬁcient penetration of photosensitizer and light [59]. It may be useful for resistant cases of localized plaques, particularly in the head and neck region [60]. 7.7.5 Benign Lesions 7.7.5.1 Warts Attempts to treat warts with PDT date back to the ﬁrst topical application of ALA by Kennedy, which was not effective [61]. In a more recent study, ALA-PDT was applied for a maximum of four times versus placebo resulting in 87 % clearance versus 17 % in the placebo group [62]. These results show that ALA-PDT in combination with a sufﬁcient keratolysis is an alternative in the treatment of recalcitrant warts. Pain is also reported during the treatment; therefore, the beneﬁt is questionable as ﬂashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser treatment is at least equally effective after keratolysis and less time consuming. 7 PDT in Dermatology 149 7.7.6 Genital Warts HPV-induced genital warts show an increasing incidence and present considerable problems both for the individual and the health care system. Recurrence rates between 20 and 50 % are reported after surgical CO2-laser therapy, other therapies are even less effective. With a high rate of intra-vaginal and intra-anal involvement other therapies (imiquimod, podophyllin-toxin) are usually limited. There are a larger number of single institution reports on smaller numbers of patients with genital warts with variable response rates [63], but due to the at least partially strong hyperkeratosis a complete topical photosensitization is rather questionable. We have found a weak and not reproducible accumulation of PpIX in genital warts in patients with both AIN and genital warts, who where sensitized for AIN treatment in ‘‘sandwich-PDT’’. 7.7.7 Acne After ﬁrst emphatic reports on the treatment of acne with PpIX-PDT more recent studies revealed equally good results after repeated treatments but also disclosed the high rate of severe side effects as pain, erythema, skin edema, transient hyper- pigmentation, sometimes even blistering or an acute exacerbation [64]. However, as the basic therapeutic concept seems to be effective other modiﬁed treatment protocols may reduce the rate and severity in the future. 7.7.8 Skin Rejuvenation The efﬁcacy of topical PDT for rejuvenation of photoaged skin has been dem- onstrated in several studies. Photosensitizer concentration, application and incu- bation times, light sources (often IPL), light dose, and number of treatments vary between the studies and differ signiﬁcantly from those in topical PDT for pre- malignant and malignant diseases. An excellent overview has been published recently by Kohl and Karrer [65]. 7.7.9 Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitical disease which appears after single or multiple skin lesions after infection with some of the subspecies of the intracellular parasite Leishmania. It presents a common health problem and standard treatments are often ineffective. The systemic variant is called Kala-Azar. Clinical reports have shown promising results from PpIX-PDT as a treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis. But more recent basic studies revealed an unspeciﬁc action by destruction of host cells and lack of antiparasitical effect [66, 67]. 150 C. M. Philipp 7.7.10 Others Topical PpIX-PDT is also mentioned in the literature as treatment option for granuloma anulare, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, hidradenitis suppurativa, and lichen sclerosus. The number of patients treated in each group is relatively small and ﬁnal assessment of the efﬁcacy not possible today. 7.8 Control of Indications and Results with Optical Coherence Tomography Topical PDT is limited to superﬁcial diseases. To settle the diagnosis of an actinic keratosis usually clinical criteria are efﬁcient but with higher grade of dysplasia the risk of development of Bowens disease increases. If the photosensitization would not reach the deeply located portions the therapy would miss the most important part of the disease. Usually biopsies are required to proof the diagnosis, but there remains some uncertainty with regard to right site for the biopsy. A comparable situation exists in the treatment of BCC, e.g., in nodular BCC. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), established in ophthalmology, has more recently become an option for imaging of the dermal structures with faster and deeper reaching systems. OCT allows the reconstruction of images from the upper skin layers, much the same as ultrasound does, but with a much higher spatial resolution. It can be used to illustrate single layers and their vertical and horizontal expansion. Imaging depth is usually about 1 mm but is dependent on the speciﬁc properties of the tissues [68–72]. It is neither able to image single cells, nor a grade of dysplasia at the present state of development. The SR-OCT system (Thorlabs) we have used includes a broadband super- luminescent diode (SLD). The particular SLD radiates at 930 nm and has a 95 nm spectral bandwidth, which yields a maximum imaging depth of approximately 1.6 mm and an axial resolution of 10 lm in skin. The lateral resolution varies with the tissues between 10 to 15 lm. In all displayed pictures the OCT image grasps 2 mm horizontally and 1 mm vertically. The SLD is ﬁber-coupled to a Michelson interferometer. The interference signal, from the sample and reference arm reﬂections, is coupled back into the same ﬁber and is redirected by the ﬁber optic coupler to a high-speed spectrometer. The spectrum exhibits peaks and troughs, and the period of such a modulation is proportional to the optical path difference (OPD) in the interferometer [73]. If multilayered objects such as tissue are imaged, each layer imprints its own modulation periodicity depending on its depth (OPD), with the amplitude of the spectrum modulation proportional to the square root of the reﬂectivity of that layer. A CCD camera can be used to transform the optical spectrum into an electrical signal which exhibits ripples of different frequencies. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the spectrum of the CCD signal translates the periodicity of the channeled spectrum into peaks of different frequency, related to 7 PDT in Dermatology 151 the path imbalance (Fig. 7.10). Immersion with Instillagel\u0003 was used to reduce surface reﬂection for optimized images by index matching. In terms of optical properties the upper layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, is a smooth reﬂecting surface and some of the incident light will be scattered by its multiple layers of keratin. The lower layer of the epidermis is built up of proliferating cells and is usually more transparent. The dermis consists mainly of cells, collagen, and elastic ﬁbers with a hydrocolloid surrounding and blood vessels. It also bears adjacent skin structures such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Each of these structures shows typical three dimensional pat- terns of cellular aggregation and will be displayed in the OCT images with regard to their optical properties, i.e., difference in refractive index compared to adjacent tissues. The base is formed by the subcutis with larger blood vessels, sweat glands, and nerves for the upper skin layers as well as the hypodermic fat and connective tissue, which may be displayed also. The OCT can produce images of the layers of skin and their changes (AK) as well as dermal tumors (BCC) and display their vertical and horizontal dimensions proportionally. The imaging depth is slightly variable and depends on the optical density, scattering, and absorption parameters of the tissues and may be distorted by hair or dust particles on the surface. However, below 1 mm the imaging quality decreases signiﬁcantly with currently available systems. In healthy skin, a good correlation between the images of histological samples and the two-dimensional OCT images was found. In diseased skin equivalents of typical gross histological features of changes in dermal layers, epithelial dysplasia as AK and BCC and could be found in OCT images [74]. Although the spatial resolution in turbid media is less than in air and does not allow the observation of cellular features or thin layers (e.g., the basal membrane) the different skin layers can clearly be distinguished [75] by currently available OCT systems. We there- fore use OCT routinely as investigative tool in the clinical evaluation of actinic Fig. 7.10 OCT, schematic 152 C. M. Philipp keratosis and NMSC lesions, both for settling the indication for either topical or systemic PDT and for control of the post-PDT outcome. 7.8.1 OCT Imaging of Actinic Keratosis The actinic keratosis is a potential preliminary stage of Bowen’s disease and may develop into a SCC. It usually appears in sun exposed skin areas, e.g., nose, forehead, temples, backs of the hand, ears. AK appears as a well-deﬁned, reddened skin area with epithelial alterations (Fig. 7.11). Histopathology of AK shows an acanthosis and a thickened or watery stratum corneum or ulceration (Fig. 7.12). In this sample of a AK, the thickened stratum corneum is visible as a bright line in OCT (Figs. 7.13, 7.14). The epithelium is broad and with a brighter and more condensed aspect when compared to healthy skin; the dermal layer appears as a Fig. 7.11 Clinical image of AK Fig. 7.12 Histopathology of AK 7 PDT in Dermatology 153 relatively thin band with a bright signal (high lucidity). In Fig. 7.13, the image taken from the scalp, dandruff is visible on top of the stratum corneum. Figure 7.14 shows partially on the right side erosive AK (right) and hyperkeratotic rim (left), erosive AK may display different patterns. However, as single cells are not displayed due to the lack of resolution in OCT imaging the grade of dysplasia can only be assessed by secondary pattern changes. 7.8.2 OCT Imaging of Bowen’s Disease Bowen’s disease is an intraepithelial SCC (carcinoma in situ). Invasion into deeper skin layers is possible and has to be excluded before local treatment as metastases are possible in the invasive disease. This skin tumor is also promoted by UV-light, chemical materials (e.g., arsenic) or certain viruses (HPV). BD appears as a red or white demarcated skin area (Fig. 7.15) with hyperkeratosis and may ulcerate in later phases of the disease. In histopathology an irregular epidermal layer is found with hyperkeratosis and acanthosis and an irregular thickness with portions reaching deep into the dermis (Fig. 7.16). Fig. 7.13 OCT of AK at the hairy head (d dandruff, sc stratum corneum, e epithelium, bm level of basal membrane) Fig. 7.14 OCT image of AK with hyperkeratosis (left) and ulceration (right) 154 C. M. Philipp Comparison of the histopathological image with the OCT image (Fig. 7.17) shows a good correlation for the appearance of the thickened stratum corneum and the upper layers of the epidermis. The loss of visualization of the dermal epidermal junction due to the thickness of the upper layers is a signiﬁcant sign. The plane of the basal membrane is not depicted in the obtained OCT image as it fades into black for deeper layers. In non-hyperkeratotic lesions or after removal of the hyperkeratosis the trans- formation into Bowens disease is depicted by irregular portions of the epithelial layer that penetrate through the region of the basal membrane into the corium. These regions, once depicted by OCT, may be evaluated in the near future by 2-photon-microscopy (2PM, TPM), another optical method that provides 3D insight views of cells and at the same time allows spectroscopic, time resolved ﬂuorescence or Raman spectroscopy measurements with a single instrument. A new device that could obtain images comparable to sectional histology com- bined with the mentioned properties was described by Göppner et al. recently [76].

M. Philipp 7.8.3 OCT Imaging of Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma is an inﬁltrative and destructive growing tumor, usually without metastasis. The most frequent cause for the development of the BCC is UV-light damage, in particular with light skin types. Basically, three types of BCC can be distinguished: the superﬁcial, nodular, and morpheic form, although the German guidelines discriminate between 10 types. Figure 7.18 shows the clinical appearance of a solid BCC, Fig. 7.19 the histological preparation of a sample from the same tumor. TheOCT image(Fig. 7.20) is characterized by nodular structures in the dermis. Even cystic formations in cystic BCC can be found in the corresponding OCT image (Figs. 7.21, 7.22). A clinical image of a morpheic BCC at the thorax is Fig. 7.20 OCT image of solid BCC displaying the typical nodules (n) located below the epidermis with the stratum corneum (sc) and small vessels (v) Fig. 7.21 Histopathological image of a cystic BCC 7 PDT in Dermatology 157 Fig. 7.23 Clinical image of morpheic BCC Fig. 7.22 OCT image of cystic BCC, (n nodular structures of BCC, C cysts, e epithelial layer, B plane of the basal membrane) Fig. 7.24 Histopathological image of the morpheic BCC in Fig. 7.23 158 C. M. Philipp given in Fig. 7.23, the corresponding histopathological image (Fig. 7.24) shows the multiple small extensions of the tumor, which correspond to the dark sub- epithelial structures in the OCT image (Fig. 7.25). 7.9 Conclusion In conclusion PDT is not a ‘‘promising technique’’ but a substantial part of der- matologic-oncology practice. The concept of a prodrug that is converted to the active substance preferably by tumors allows a high contrast between diseased and surrounding tissues and makes this therapy easy to handle and safe. Currently, most of the applications are related to low grade superﬁcial lesions, but with potentially upcoming new systemic photosensitizers and improvement of nonin- vasive imaging of skin tumors larger tumors will come in reach and the success story will continue.

Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD), ﬂuorescence guided tumour resection (FGR) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is undergoing intensive clinical investigations as adjuvant treatment for malignant brain tumours. Besides many reports on clinical phase I/II trials for PDT for malignant brain tumours, there are only few controlled clinical trials. Variations in treatment protocols make the evaluation scientiﬁcally difﬁcult; however, there is a clear trend towards prolonging median survival after one single photo dynamic treat- ment as compared to standard therapeutic regiments. According to a met-analysis the median survival for primary glioblastoma multi-forme WHO IV after PDT was 22 months and for recurrent GBM 9 months as compared to standard conventional treatment which is 15 and 3 months, respectively. Fluorescence-guided resection of the tumour demonstrated signiﬁcant greater reduction of tumour burden. The combination of PDD/FGR and intra operative PDT (‘‘to see and to treat’’) offers an exciting approach to the treatment of malignant brain tumours. Photodynamic treatment supported by observational studies with combined total of [ 1,000 patients and 3 controlled trials in GBMs. PDT was highly selective, safe, signif- icantly improved good quality survival and delayed tumour relapse (p \\ 0.001). The following chapter provides an overview on the current clinical data of PDT as well as photosensitisers, technical developments and indications for photodynamic application in neurosurgery.

Glio- blastomas are the third most common cause of cancer death in patients between 15 and 35 years old. Malignant brain tumours carry a lethal prognosis with a median survival of 15 months for grade IV tumours [1–3] (Table 8.1). The 5-year survival is under 1 %. Surgery is the ﬁrst and most important step in the treatment of malignant gliomas and remains the mainstay in therapy. However, radical resection is hardly possible due to inﬁltration into normal brain parenchyma. Recurrences occur 95 % locally within 2 cm from the initial site and arise from tumour cells (guerrilla or satellite cells) embedded in the area of oedematous or normal brain adjacent to tumour (brain adjacent to tumour region ‘‘BAT’’) [2]. For almost 30 years, Pho- todynamic therapy (PDT) has been used to treat malignant brain tumours and is further under intensive clinical investigations as adjunctive treatment for malig- nant brain tumours [2–5]. Since photosensitisers are accumulated in pathological brain tissue to a higher extent than in normal brain parenchyma, subsequent activation by light produces a variety of cytotoxic oxidative reactions which induce selective tumour destruction [6, 7]. Therefore, PDT offers more selectivity as compared to chemo and radiotherapy and seems to be a logical concept for brain tumours inﬁltrating into normal brain. Clinical studies demonstrated a beneﬁt for the patients treated with PS-medi- ated PDT in terms of prolongation of median survival time as well as quality of life [2, 5, 7–10]. Fluorescence guided delineation had been under investigation to distinguish normal from pathological brain tissue with ﬂuorescine and tetracycline or auto ﬂuorescence [11–13], however, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity were too low to be of clinical signiﬁcance for neurosurgery. Modern intraoperative imaging techniques such as MRT, CT, neuronavigation and ultrasound are expensive tools and—which is very important in clinical use—do not calculate the brain shift during operation. The ﬂuorescence properties of photosensitisers such as HPD, 5-Amino-Leavulinic- Acid (5-ALA) and chlorine compounds such as meta-TetraHydroxyPhenylChlorin (mTHPC) and Fotolon (Clorine e 6) are used for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) Table 8.1 outcome of malignant gliomas WHO gradings, therapeutic strategies [1] Histology WHO Therapy Recurrence time Median survival Glioblastoma multiforme WHO IV (GBM) Surg, CHT, XRT 6 months 15 months Anaplastic Astrocytoma WHO III (AA) Surg, CHT, XRT 18 months 3 years Astrocytoma II Surg, XRT 3 years 6 years Astrocytoma I Surg, 8 years 10 years Surg surgery, XRT radiotherapy, CHT chemotherapy 166 H. Kostron and FGR has been established in various clinical applications and in neurosurgery [11–17]. This intraoperative PDD allows a ‘‘real-time’’ optical delineation of normal and malignant tissue which facilitates intraoperative orientation and allows ﬂuorescence guided resection (FGR) which results in a more radical resection. This translates directly in a signiﬁcant longer survival [4, 15, 17]. This was also combined with PDD and PDT involving two sensitizers; one sensitizer for diag- nosis (ALA) and one for treatment (Fotofrin) [17, 18]. Intraoperative mTHPC mediated PDD followed by intraoperative PDT has been reported in recurrent glioblastoma multi-forme with promising results [15–17]. Simultaneous intraoperative PDT involving only one sensitizer offers a logical supplement to PDD according to the KOSTRON slogan ‘‘to see and to treat’’ [15]. This review analyses the available data and draws the future potential of PDD and PDT for its application in neurosurgery. 8.2 Basics: Photosensitisers, PDT Mechanisms, Effect on Normal Brain 8.2.1 Photosensitisers Photosensitisers used for brain tumours require a different proﬁle than for e.g. superﬁcial tumours. The tumour burden in the brain is much larger and radical resection is hardly possible because of inﬁltration of tumour into normal brain tissue of 2 cm and deeper. The ideal neurosurgical sensitizer should have (a) A high selectivity for tumour and tumour cells and should cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and target also tumour cells embedded in normal brain tissue (guerrilla cells); (b) Photo activation in the near infrared range and beyond; (c) Strong ﬂuorescence properties; (d) High quantum yield; (e) No systemic toxicity with no or only short lasting sensitisation of the skin [19]. The photosensitizer of ﬁrst generation Hematoporphyrin deriva- tive (HPD) is a complex mixture of various porphyrins [20, 21], which was used for most of the basic experimental work and almost exclusively in the clinical brain tumour studies. HPD has its optimum absorption between 628 and 635 nm and allows a penetration depths up to 5 mm depending on the tissue. The dose in clinical use is 2 mg/kg injected intravenously. Energies required are ranging from 60 to 260 J/cm2. The ratio of the concentration in tumour to normal brain ranges from 2.5 to 4:1 and in animal experiments it ranges up to 12:1. In human GBM the concentrations vary signiﬁcantly from 1.46 to 4.00 lg/g wet weight. The con- centration in the BAT region ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 lg/g. In this series the amount of PS correlated positively with the survival of the patients [7]. Light sensitisation of the skin was observed for up to 8 weeks. Meso-tetra-hydroxyphenyl-chlorin (mTHPC, Tempoforin, FOSCAN\u0002) has been used as second generation sensitizer with a higher tumour to brain ratio in humans of 10:1 at a dose between 0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg and light doses of 20 J/cm2 8 Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy 167 [15, 16, 22–24]. The ratio in the BAT region is around 1:20. Clinical results of FGR mediated by mTHPC followed by intraoperative PDT have demonstrated a signiﬁcant beneﬁt for survival in recurrent malignant gliomas [15]. Light sensiti- sation of the skin was observed for 4 weeks. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) induced protoporhyrin IX produces excellent ﬂuorescence for diagnostic purposes and is activated at 635 nm. Sufﬁcient cell kill of superﬁcial tumours such as bladder and skin tumour is achieved at energies of up to 100 J/cm2 [14, 23, 25]. The ratio of ALA concentration in tumour to normal brain is around 4:1. Currently there is a phase I/II trial for PDT mediated by ALA under investigation [26]. A randomised phase III trial investigating the effect of ALA (GLIOLAN\u0002) mediated FGR demonstrated a higher incidence of radical tumour removal than under white light, which translated also in a progression free survival but did not inﬂuence overall survival [14]. Skin phototoxicity after ALA application is only few to 24 h after instillation. Bacteriochlorine, Benzoporphyrin (BPD), boronated porphyrins, Chloralumin- ium-phthalocyanine (AlClPc), Fotolon (clorine e6), hypericin, methylene blue, Tin Ethyl purpurin (SnET2) and texaphrin are further sensitizers with great potential for its use in brain tumour surgery [27–31]. 8.2.2 PDT-Mechanisms The mechanisms of PDT are based on photo-oxidative reactions and depend strongly on the type of photosensisers, light dose regime and investigated tumour cells, the pathology, the absorbance and chemistry of the sensitizer and the incubation time [6, 8, 10, 19]. Over the past years, many different pathways of PDT-mediated cytotoxicity were found at the molecular level. Besides the primary vascular damage and direct cellular effect [7], further cytotoxic mechanisms are mediated by cytokine mod- ulation and autophagy [32]. Transforming growth factor, ﬁbroblastic growth fac- tor, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 but also PDGF and TNF play a role in mediating the photo-oxidative cytotoxic process [33, 34]. Interleucin-6, an auto- endocrine stimulator for glial tumours, is signiﬁcantly reduced in cell cultures after PDT [35, 36]. Oxidative stress activates early response genes further modulates apoptosis depending on the cell lines employed [37]. Since porphyrins are incorporated in lipoproteins, the low-density-lipoprotein receptor pathway is one important factor for the selective accumulation of porphyrins by glial tumour cells express signiﬁcant amounts of LDL–lipoprotein receptor related protein. One other contribution to cytotoxic efﬁcacy might be the inhibition of migration of human glioma cells [38]. All these above mechanisms outlined above could contribute to the PDT effect exceeding the depths penetration of the activating light (bystander effect). More details of the mechanisms of PDT are found in this book at Chaps. 2 and 3. 168 H. Kostron 8.2.3 Effect of PDT on Normal Brain Despite a high selectivity of PS towards tumour cells, injury to normal glial and neurones had been observed in the normal brain [6, 19, 23, 31]. This damage depends on the type of sensitizer used, the concentration of sensitizer, time interval of sen- sitisation to light exposure and light density. An important part plays the blood– brain-barrier which protects the normal brain from toxic substances. Whereas the blood–brain-barrier does not exist within the tumour, and the surrounding oedema, this barrier is well intact in the brain embedding tumour island [23, 24]. However, the evidence is mostly derived from experimental work. HPD is taken up by normal brain in a dose depending fashion varying from 0.2 lg/g to 1.2/g lg wet weight brain tissue at a dose of 10 and 20 mg HPD/kg bodyweight. Twenty mg/kg and 100 J cause death of the animals due to severe swelling. Fluorescence diagnosis demonstrated the presence of the sensitizer mostly along the ﬁbre bundles of the white matter. Upon light activation ﬁrst break down of blood–brain barrier, swelling of astrocytes and neurones are observed. After 2 days coagulation necrosis occurs in a dose dependent fashion at concentrations higher than 5 mg HPD [7, 11, 25]. Intra tumoral or intra parenchymal instillation of the sensitizer does not exhibit selec- tivity; however, the higher doses resulted in higher tissue concentrations which again created a greater toxicity. Experimental studies used high doses of HPD whereas at clinical relevant doses of 2.0 mg to 5 mg/kg only few reports described morphological changes in the normal human brain [7, 33]. Focal necrosis around the vessels 24 h after intra-arterial injection was found in only one series [7], whereas oedema post PDT was described by almost all authors. Muller reported a signiﬁcant increase of intracranial pressure despite avoiding hyperthermia effects [39]. After stereotactic PDT cerebral oedema was observed in most of the cases. The amount of postoperative swelling correlates with the residual tumour volume, so the tumour resection has to be performed to the out- most possible extent [7, 39]. 8.3 Interaction of PDT with Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy In 2000 Temozolemide was introduced as highly effective chemo therapy for malignant brain tumours and constitutes now the golden standard in conjunction with surgery and ionising radiation [40, 41]. Steroids (like dexamethasone) are widely used in neurosurgery for the treatment of tumour-associated oedema and might decrease the uptake of PS into the tumour cells [7]. However, this varies strongly within the various cell lines and tumour. Doxo- rubicin e.g. potentiates therapeutic efﬁcacy of mTHPC-mediated PDT signiﬁcantly when given after light irradiation, but to a lesser extent when given prior [42]. There are no reported clinical data on the interaction of PDT and chemotherapy. 8 Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy 169 PDT might be of advantage in the treatment of tumours not responding to chemotherapy because cells which express multi drug resistance features are less likely to be cross-resistant to PDT [43]. The combination of PDT and targeted drugs, such as VGF, PDGF, EGFR as well as factors enhancing apoptosis and phagocytoses enhance or potentiate the efﬁcacy of PDT [44–46]. A promising approach is the combination of Bleomycin and Photochemical internalisation (PCI) in various clinical indications [47–49]. 8.3.1 Interaction of PDT and Ionising Radiation Ionising radiation is a standard therapy in the postoperative course after surgery of malignant brain tumours [1, 4, 40]. The interaction of HPD-mediated PDT and ionising radiation was investigated in a rat gliosarcoma model 9L. After intra- peritoneal injection and low doses of HPD an additive effect of both treatment modalities could be observed, whereas direct injection with high intra tumoral concentration and high light doses of 120 J/cm2 and 4 Gy resulted in signiﬁcant greater response indicating a potentiating mechanism. The effect was more pro- nounced when PDT was followed by XRT within 30 min [50]. The underlying mechanism is thought to be the inhibition of the potential lethal damage induced by PDT. In a more recent study, employing human glioma spheroids study it was shown that gamma radiation and PDT interact in a synergistic manner only if both light ﬂuence and gamma radiation dose exceed approximately 25 J cm-2 and 8 Gy, respectively [51]. In an early series at the authors institution patients with de novo glioblastomas were treated with one single dose of 4 Gy of electrons within 30 min after PDT [7]. The results remained unchanged to that ones without immediate x-radiation treatment; therefore, this treatment protocol were not continued. Radiotherapy was commenced in addition in all de novo patients within 10 days after surgery and PDT. We did not see any side effects from this radiotherapy. There were also no side effects reported in the 5-ALA-mediated PDD/FGR trial where ionising radi- ation of 60 Gy was commenced within 4 weeks after sensitisation [7]. There is a recent feasibility report of the combination of stereotactic radio surgery and PDT in brain tumours which showed a synergistic effect and gave promising results [52]. 8.4 Instrumentation Initial work was performed with argon dye laser systems or xenon arc lamps with adequate ﬁltering. Now LEDs and diode lasers are available in almost all desired wavelengths and are much reliable and cost effective. Laser light delivery in Neurosurgery has become the state of the art and interstitial PDT has become 170 H. Kostron possible. Light delivery and dosimeter is a critical point in PDT and especially in neurosurgery with no ideally geometrical shaped or superﬁcial lesions and irreg- ular and large volumes must be treated [53, 54]. An inﬂatable balloon is employed to facilitate dosimetry. In general the cavity or the balloon is ﬁlled with a 0.1 % concentration of intra-lipid solution or plane water to achieve a homogeneous light distribution [7, 39]. The superﬁcial light delivery is performed mostly by bare ﬁbres or spheroids. Interstitial light appli- cation is performed by cylindrical ﬁbres at power density of 250 to 350 mW/cm2 without producing carbonisation at the ﬁbre tip. The placements of up to 6 ﬁbres are done by 3D planning and stereotactic methods [40–42, 55, 56]. Repetitive PDT treatments were given using 100 J/cm2 of a Diode Laser at 630 nm [57, 58]. Important parameters such as ﬂuence rate, sensitizer ﬂuorescence intensity, and changes in local blood oxygen saturation can be measured with the same ﬁbres that deliver the therapeutic light [59]. 8.5 Photodynamic diagnosis and Fluorescence Guided Resection At the beginning of the photodynamic story, PDT was strongly driven forward to improve the results in the treatment of various cancer entities and brain tumours, since there was no other effective treatment. Since the late 90 the ﬂuorescence aspects of photodynamics became more important. Besides phototoxic properties, the ﬂuorescence abilities of the photosensitiser are used for optical discrimination of normal and malignant tissue allowing intraoperative PDD and FGR thus min- imising residual tumour [11]. Intraoperative ﬂuorescence is induced by UV light (370–440 nm). The induced ﬂuorescence light is collected by a dual optical ﬁbre to a CCD camera and a spectroscopy. Normal white light illumination of the surgical microscope can be switched to blue light excitation with simultaneous observation by the naked eye. The induced ﬂuorescence could be seen direct through the observer light path. Standard neurosurgical microscopes (Zeiss, Leica) have been adopted for ﬂuorescence detection [11, 16, 17, 60]. Reduced dose of Foscan is under clinical examination (Kostron personal comm). 8.6 Methods and Patients The indications for PDT are primary and recurrent malignant brain tumours. Slow growing tumours such as low-grade astrocytomas or other benign lesions are not taking up sufﬁcient concentrations of photosensitisers. Tumours which are not protected by the blood brain barrier (BBB) are a good indication for PDD/PDT such as Scull base tumours or tumours of the pituitary gland. There are similar ﬁndings in maxillofacial tumour patients [61]. Most recent case reports include 8 Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy 171 patients suffering from metastasis, malignant meningeomas and recurrent pituitary tumours (Table 8.2)[62, 63]. The patients were treated with a variation of PS, such as various formulations of HPD (HPD, Photofrin I, DHE, Photofrin II, Photosan 3 or mTHPC. In order to utilise PS also for intraoperative diagnostics Photofrin and 5-ALA are combined [5, 60, 62, 63] or mTHPC for both indications [15, 16]. Photolon has equal properties but there are only mostly experimental and few favourable clinical data are published [31]. The following protocol for PDT is generally accepted. The patients are sensi- tised with HPD (Photofrin) 2, 5 mg/kg or with Foscan\u0002 0.15 mg/kg BW 24 to 48 h prior to a standard craniotomy [7, 15, 17]. Steroids are withdrawn 2 to 3 days prior to sensitisation, so far tolerated. A standard craniotomy is performed and after maximal tumour resection under white light the resection is continued with intraoperative PDD and under ﬂuorescence guidance. Nowadays, PDT is performed by diode lasers emitting at the required wave- lengths. The light is delivered by bare ﬁbres coupled into a modiﬁed balloon system, by a spherical distributor or by a 20 mm long cylinder for interstitial treatment. The power density for surface illumination varies depending on the lasers used. For interstitial treatment the power density ranges from 250 to 350 mW. For treatments of HPD-mediated PDT the light dose was increasing from 20 J/cm2 for the ﬁrst patients to the standard dose of up to 250 J/cm2. Residual tumour in functional areas can be treated by interstitial PDT which is performed at a power density of 250–350 mW/sec to a total dose of 150 J. The light dose for the mTHPC sensitised patients was 20 J/cm 2 and the interstitial Table 8.2 Metastasis, malignant meningeomas and recurrent pituitary tumours Author Number of patients Histology Median survival Eljamel 2008 [17, 65] 103 Variousa braintumors 13 mo for GBM Muller 2006 [39] 112 HGG 11 mo Kaneko 2008 [62] 90 GBM 18.5 mo AA 36.2 mo Kostron 2006 [7, 15] 116 GBM 19 mo Recur GBM 9 mo Stylli 2006 [63] 350 GBM 24.3 mo Recurr GBM 16 mo AA 76.7 Pichlmeier 2006 [14] 243 GBM GBM cr 16.7 GBM ic 11.8 GBM Glioblastoma multiforme WHO IV AA Anaplastic Astrocytoma WHO III HGG High-grade glioma WHO IV and WHO III GBM cr GBM with complete resection [ 95 % GBM ic GBM with incomplete resection a Various braintumours GBM, metastasis, meningeomas, pituitary tumour 172 H.

After mobilisation the patients were slowly exposed to normal sunlight to allow pigmentation of the skin. A light metre was provided for the patients to control light exposure. The patients were followed by clinical exams and MRI/CT scans every 3 months [15]. 8.7 Clinical Trials and Results Since 1980 more than 1,000 patients had been treated meanwhile world-wide [7, 39, 62–64] (Table 8.2). This number is relatively low as compared to the amount of patients treated with lung, bladder or skin cancers. The reason might be that the incidence of brain tumours is lower and their treatment more complicated since it requires highly sophisticated surgery and instrumentation. In general the patients were sensitised with HPD-Photofrin in various formulations and only one trial used mTHPC as sensitizer [15]. The majority of the patients were sensitised parenterally and few patients received intra tumoural or intra-arterial sensitisation [7]. Light irradiation was performed with photo radiation lamps, dye laser, gold vapour KTP dye laser and diode lasers. Patients presenting with primary glio- blastomas underwent 45 Gy of irradiation within 4 weeks after PDT. The light dose was initially low at 70 to 180 J/cm2 which was ﬁnally increased to 240 J/cm2 in the majority of the patients. Most of the patients underwent standard craniot- omies and open tumour resection [7]. Stereotactic approach was chosen by several other authors [7, 26, 56]. Muller observed complete response with excellent sur- vival in cases where a cystic geometric tumour cavity allowed a very homoge- neous light distribution [39]. The results of the reported cases of high-grade tumours are difﬁcult to evaluate because the histology are in general not detailed. High-grade gliomas consisting of WHO grade IV and grade III gliomas are often pooled but they have a signiﬁcantly different prognosis with 15 months vs. 36 months, respectively. 8.7.1 Primary Glioblastoma Primary glioblastoma were initially treated with various formulations of HPD 24–72 h prior to treatment. These patients received in addition conventional radiotherapy of total 55–60 Gy as well as chemotherapy (Temozolemide). Photofrin\u0002 is now easily commercially available. The median time to progression was 13 months. Patients with recurrences after PDT underwent retreatment with PDT without any other treatment. Their median survival was 10 months. There was no adverse effect from a second photosensitization and photo radiation [7]. 8 Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy 173 The total median survival of primary glioblastomas in the compiled series was 19 months (range 9–27 months). In the Canadian phase III study 112 patients were treated with PDT and adjuvant radiotherapy of 45 Gy. The median survival was 9 months. Furthermore, at this institution a randomised phase III was conducted enrolling 77 primary GBM which underwent whether surgery plus PDT and XRT or surgery and XRT. The results were not signiﬁcant with a median survival of 11 months vs. 8 months, respectively [39]. A similar result was reported enrolling 31 patients which had a median survival of 13 months after FGR and PDT as compared to 6 months in the controls [17].The largest series enrolling more than 350 high-grade gliomas was reported by Stilly 2006 in an uncontrolled trial [63]. Primary gliomas received 45 Gy in addition and reached a median survival of 27 months. Eljamel conducted an innovative randomised trial combining FGR and metronomic PDT, which yielded signiﬁcant better results as compared to the control group [17]. Recurrent glioblastomas: Thirty-nine patients with recurrent glioblastomas were treated photodynamically because of treatment failures. The median time to ﬁrst recurrence without any other treatment was 7 months and the median survival time after PDT was 9 months (range 3–18 months). Fourteen patients were re- operated after 12 months having presented with a ﬁrst recurrence. No further treatment was commenced. These patients suffered another recurrence within 3 months. After a third surgical procedure and PDT the median time to recurrence was 6 months (3–8 months) [7]. Stylli reported a median survival of 18 months for patients with recurrent high- grade gliomas and PDT [63]. Muller reported 64 recurrent glioblastomas which underwent a dose escalation in a randomised phase III trial. Patients receiving more than 1,700 J had a median survival of 9.2 months, whereas those receiving less than that had a survival of 6, 6 months [39]. Kaneko had treated 90 patients mostly bearing glioblastomas with a median survival of 18 months [62]. Fifteen recurrent glioblastomas were treated by mul- tiple interstitial ﬁbres which were based on a computed 3D image and stereotac- tically placed interstitial ﬁbres. The light dose was 100 J/cm2 with median survival of 6 months or a light dose of up to 400 J/cm [55, 56], (Figs. 8.1, 8.2) High-grade gliomas WHO III: Over 120 recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas were treated photodynamically with energies varying from 45 to 175 J/cm 2 with a median survival of 56 months (range 36, 0 to 76, 7 months). Malignant mixed oligo-astrocytomas and ependymomas had a 2 year survival of 37 and 75 %, respectively [5, 7, 39, 62, 63]. Brain tumours of other origin: Malignant meningiomas were treated with light dose up to 260 J/cm 2 and the median survival was 6, 15 and 23 months, respectively. Pituitary tumours: These are benign tumours, however, when they recur they produce anatomical malignancy. Thirty patients suffering from recurrent pituitary tumours were treated in combination with ﬂuorescence-guided localisation and resection because of repeated recurrence and treatment failures. All cases 174 H. Kostron responded favourable all showing no progression or recurrence of tumours for 2, 5 years [64]. Metastasis: There are 46 reported cases of metastasis of various origins. All except of melanoma metastasis showed complete or partial response and patients usually died to systemic progress with local control. Surgiscope Neuronavigation Fig. 8.1 Pre-operative planning for stereoactic PDT treatment after FOSCAN mediated ﬂuorescence guided resection Fig. 8.2 Operative setting for stereotactic ﬁbre insertion for PDT 8 Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy 175 8.7.2 MTHPC-Mediated PDT Twenty-four patients with primary or recurrent GBM were enrolled in this trial and demonstrated a median time to progression of 4 months and a median survival time of 9 months [15].The patients with metastasis demonstrated complete tumour control in 2 cases for up to 28 months, 2 were progressing 6 months after treat- ment and were lost to follow up. One scull base tumour demonstrated a complete response with a follow up of 24 months; the other relapsed within 7 months. All patients tolerated mTHPC-mediated treatment well; one patient suffered swelling of the treated area. Two patients experienced severe toxic reaction to sunlight due to unintentional exposure to direct sunlight requiring conventional treatment. One patient was treated with a malignant nerve sheath tumour of the scull base and the tumour recurred 12 months after treatment. 8.7.3 Photodynamic diagnosis and Fluorescence Guided Resection 4.9 Maximal tumour resection is directly correlated with a longer survival [1, 2, 4, 39] which can be facilitated by intra operative PDD and FGR. Five-ALA (GLIO- LAN\u0002) is given orally at 20 mg/kg BW 3 to 4 h prior to surgery or also FOSCAN \u0002 0.15 mg/kg BW whether 24 or 96 h prior to surgery. A randomised phase III trial proved that FGR mediated by 5-ALA results in a signiﬁcant higher amount of almost complete resection than without, which translated in greater survival of 16.7 versus 11.8, respectively [60]. Foscan-mediated PDD and FGR was investi- gated in recurrent GBM and compared to a cohort of paired patients. The histo- logical specimens of ﬂuorescent tissue correlated to a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 89 and 96 %, respectively [16, 22]. Complete resection was achieved in 68 % as compared to 35 % in the control group which was demonstrated by MRI within 48 h after surgery. These latter patients underwent immediate PDT after FGR tumour resection was accomplished. The results were signiﬁcantly longer in the treatment group with 9 months as compared to the matched pair group, which lived 3 months in the median [15]. Since tumour grows invasively also functional areas such as speech, motor function or psychic function, complete resection cannot be performed in order not to harm the patient. In such cases, interstitial PDT can be performed in those functional areas [18, 55, 56]. Care has to be taken not to harm the patients since an impaired neurological status (KPI \\ 60 %) correlates with a shorter overall survival [1], (Figs. 8.3, 8.4), (8.5) 176 H. Kostron 8.8 Discussion The purpose of this review is to summarise the current available data on brain tumours which underwent photodynamic-mediated therapies, which includes FGR/PDD and PDT. Because of variations in the treatment protocols of each individual investigator, the data are hardly comparable. There are two randomised Treatment superficial interstitial stereotactic Fig. 8.3 Typical intraoperative PDT treatment; clockwise: intracavitary balloon treatment; interstitial treatment with laser ﬁbres in place; stereotactic treatment Fig. 8.4 Post-operative resection cavity with no hint of residual tumour, note the whitish area at one o’clock 8 Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy 177 phase III trials, one trial with paired controls and 15 uncontrolled trials in com- parison with historical controls. The largest series currently comes from Melbourne which recruited more than 350 patients presenting with high-grade gliomas, the majority being recurrent tumours [63]. The median survival for primary glioblastomas undergoing Photo- frin-mediated PDT (180–240 J/cm 2) and 45 Gy of radiation was 24 months, anaplastic gliomas WHO III had a median survival of 76, 7 months, respectively. Recurrent gliomas demonstrated a 16 months median survival after PDT as compared to historical controls which lived in the median 12 months. Muller reported on two randomised controlled phase III studies with primary as well as recurrent on high-grade gliomas which were sensitised with 2 mg Photo- frin 12–36 h prior to operation [39]. This randomised Phase III study enrolling 43 primary glioblastomas in the treatment arm and 33 patients in the control showed a trend towards prolonged survival with a difference of 3 months; however, the numbers were too small to show statistical signiﬁcance. The comparison high to low dose light radiation did not show a difference in survival, whereas a previous study reported signiﬁcant better results. Patient undergoing PDT greater than 1,700 J had a survival of 9.2 months as compared to 6.6 months who were treated with a lower dose than 1,700 J. A high light dose was always associated with a longer survival. The results for primary glioblastomas at our own institution showed a median survival of 19 months and for patients suffering from recurrent tumours 9–6 months, which is signiﬁcantly longer as the natural lifespan and up to same as with high cost chemotherapy demonstrating the PDT affectivity and efﬁciency. Direct intra-tumoural or selective intra-arterial injection performed in few patients resulted in a high intra-tumoural PS concentration; however, the results were not improved as compared to intravenous sensitisation [7]. Photosensitiser kinetics depends on the tumour blood ﬂow and oxygenation of the tumour is highly inconsistent within tumour entities and varies signiﬁcantly in in vivo and in vitro Fig. 8.5 Post-operative PDD, note the clear ﬂuorescence derived from FOSCAN at one o0clock 178 H. Kostron models [23, 24] The concentration of the sensitizer varied signiﬁcantly among the tumours even in tumours of the same histology [7, 25]. After PDT the relapses always recur locally and there is no difference in the patterns of recurrence as after conventional treatment modalities. The reason of the recurrences is multiple. In comparison to tumours localised elsewhere in the body, brain tumours exceeds 100 cm3 and more. Even after most radical resection, tumour cells embedded in the normal brain might escape PDT. This BAT area is often the site of tumour recurrence. At this critical area a low light dose and low sensitizer dose coincidence. To overcome this problem and to circumvent the BBB the sensitizer were injected directly into the tumour cavity resulting in signiﬁcant higher intra-tumoural concentration; however, the clinical results were not improved. Muller irradiated patients within 12 h after sensitisation to prevent the rapid washout of sensitizer at the BAT region [39]. Therefore, most likely a low penetration of activating light seems to be the most realistic reason for recurrences on that site [25]. In the opposite, interstitial radiation improved depth penetration to about 2 cm and dosimetry at this critical area, but this also did not improve the results [15, 55, 56, 59]. The best results were actually achieved by Stylli and Kaye using high dose of superﬁcial irradiation [63]. Different approaches in varying light delivery, timing of light delivery, varying photosensitiser concentrations and also drugs changing the micro-environment of the tumour had been investigated which will induce and prolong different photochemical and phototoxic reactions. Metronomic or multiple treatment sessions after one time sensitisation with Photofrin has been reported with favourable effects. Multiple investigations are currently performed to elucidate metronomic PDT [57, 58]. Ionising radiation was applied to the patients whether almost simultaneously or consecutively within 4 weeks after PDT. There was no observed adverse inter- action between these two modalities. In a most recent trial, there was a signiﬁcant advantage reported for PDT followed by immediate intraoperative radiation [50, 52]. A synergistic response of hyperthermia with PDT was observed when was delivered simultaneously or within 30 min after PDT [65], however, there is no clinical relevance of hyperthermia in neurooncology. Of greater importance in neurooncology might be the fact that PDT does not induce resistance to chemo- therapy and might be effective in tumours expressing multidrug resistant features [43]. PDT in combination of targeted therapies changing the molecular signature of the tumour cells could further improve the treatment response [36, 42, 44–46]. However, the interactions of PDT with current standard treatment modalities such as ionising radiation and chemotherapy is by far not yet fully elucidated and investigated. The use of carrier systems such as liposomal encapsulated photo- sensitizers or PCI enhances selectivity and the PDT-mediated cytotoxic effects signiﬁcantly [47, 49]. Vector enhanced delivery of non-viral or viral vectors are further promising approaches to enhance the selectivity and effectivity of PDT [66, 67]. PDT-speciﬁc side effects were considered as mild responding to conservative treatment with only short impairment of the patients. Besides the prolonged skin sensitivity for Photofrin and Foscan, increased intracranial pressure was reported 8 Photodynamic Diagnosis and Therapy 179 from various centres [15, 39]. A reversible diencephalic syndrome and neuropathy was reported during PDT of the middle cerebral fossa most probably due to hyperthermic effect to the midline structures [68, 69], however, this did not impair the patient’s outcome. ALA-(GLIOLAN\u0002)-mediated FGR has been approved in various countries and is considered as standard in resection for high-grade brain tumours [60]. However, despite the visualisation of the tumourous tissue the limitations in resection are functional structures such as speech, motor and intellectual function. Therefore, immediate treatment of the residual tumour in such areas is a logical concept ‘‘see and to treat’’, which was emphasised by Kostron in 1998 [11]. Foscan-mediated PDD/FGR has the advantage of only one drug performing also very efﬁciently PDT [15], whereas ALA-mediated FGR needs the addition of a second sensitizer such as Photofrin to perform PDT [17, 18]. However, it could be demonstrated that ALA-PDT induces signiﬁcant apoptosis [37] and immune mediators [35, 38]. Currently a pilot study investigates PDT-mediated 5-ALA following FGR [26]. The development of instrumentation has to be, however, as intensive as for sensitizers. Light dosimetry is critical for PDT response and under dosing might often be the cause for therapeutic failures. On-line dosimetry could prevent such failures [59]. Computer aided planning with 3D reconstruction of the remaining tumour and an exact planning of dosimetry, which can be archived by multiple stereotactic interstitial ﬁbres placed by neuronavigation systems, should be con- sidered mandatory for treating brain lesions [54–56]. The prime indications of PDT in neurosurgery are inﬁltrating high-grade gli- omas. Pituitary tumours, spinal tumours, cystic lesion at the scull base and scull base tumours and metastatic lesions are also good indications in second line therapy. Low-grade gliomas demonstrate a signiﬁcant longer survival and may be not good candidates for PDT. Also tumours in delicate areas such as brain stem must be excluded from PDT, whereas it can be used interstitially for example in the motor strip or other functional areas without impairing function [15, 19]. Novel indications are scull base tumours and tumour in the ﬁeld of ENT [61, 70] as well as osseous tumour such as metastasis of the vertebrae or bone at the scull base [71]. The sensitizers in clinical practice such as Photofrin, 5-ALA and Foscan show efﬁcacy in regard to cytotoxicity and gave proof of principle of the effect of PDT in neurooncology. Photodynamic treatment supported by several observational studies with combined total of [ 1,000 patients and 3 RCT used PDT in GBMs. PDT was highly selective, safe, signiﬁcantly improved good quality survival, and delayed tumour relapse (p \\ 0.001). Fluorescence image-guided surgery for maximum safe surgical resection achieves complete resection in [ 65 % and prolongs tumour free survival (p \\ 0.001). PDT is currently offered in only a few selected centres, although it is gaining acceptance as adjunctive treatment modality to conventional cancer therapies. The clinical potential and implementation of PDD and FGR has brought general PDT to a wider acknowledgement to the neurosurgical community and will increase the 180 H. Kostron awareness in neurosurgery. The data show that PDT especially in combination with PDD/FGR is a safe and an effective treatment for a second line therapy in neurooncology and has the potential to be the fourth mainstay in neurooncology besides surgery, chemo and radiotherapy.

Kostron Chapter 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology Keyvan Moghissi and Ron R. Allison Abstract Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) continues to evolve in the management of thoracic malignancies. The relative simplicity of this treatment, in combination with reliable tumour ablation, has allowed for function sparing treatment to become a reality for a worldwide audience. Of particular importance is the ability of PDT to offer primary or palliative therapy to a cohort of patients who may otherwise be without good treatment options. Most important is that PDT ﬁts well into the current multidisciplinary approach to cancer care as PDT compliments surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This can only help our patients in their ﬁght against the scourge known as cancer. 9.1 Introduction The architecture of the chest is based on two bony pillars; one in front, the sternum, and the other behind, the vertebral column. The pillars are connected by a series of ribs. The bony framework of the chest thus constructed resembles that of a cage, the thoracic cage, which is covered with muscles, connective tissues and skin. The breasts are, in effect, a pair of glands within the anterior chest wall. The thoracic cavity is comprised of three compartments: • Two laterals, the pleural spaces, each of which accommodates one lung. • The middle space, the mediastinum (mediastinal space), containing the heart and its great vessels.

Abdel-Kader (ed.), Photodynamic Therapy, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-39629-8_9, \u0002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 185 • The oesophagus and a number of other structures such as the thymus glands and a network of lymphatic vessels and intercalating nodes. The three spaces within the chest are separated from one another by membranes which curtain them off into compartments. The tissue component of any of the organs and structures within the thoracic cavity, and/or the chest wall, may develop malignant neoplastic changes, some of which are amongst the most important cancers in terms of incidence, difﬁculty of treatment and mortality. Lung cancer has the highest rank in incidence and death rate by cancer in men. The breast is the top of the list in women. Four cancers are particularly signiﬁcant both from the point of view of relative inadequacy of the so-called standard cancer therapy methods: surgery, chemotherapy and radio- therapy, and also from the perspective of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), these are: 1. Lung cancer 2. Oesophageal cancer 3. Mesothelioma 4. Breast cancer 9.2 PDT Mechanisms in Thoracic Oncology The modus operandi of PDT is the activation of a photosensitiser (PS) by a light of speciﬁc wavelength. Oxygen is an important third party whose presence is essential in generating cytotoxic agents, notably singlet oxygen, which induces death of the treated cell. In the laboratory situation this is called the Photodynamic Reaction (PDR) or Photodynamisch Wirkung by the German discoverer of the process [1]. The mechanism of PDR in the laboratory setting is discussed amply elsewhere in this book. Translation of PDR to a clinical situation related to thoracic malig- nancies needs some elaboration. As currently practiced clinical PDT in the thoracic region requires application of a photosensitizing agent, which is allowed time to accumulate in the tumour bed and also to clear normal tissues. Intense illumination is then applied as exclusively as possible to the tumour bed. The light energy activates the photosensitizing agent allowing for creation of the PDR which is highly toxic to the tumour and sur- rounding vasculature. To better understand this complex interaction of drug, light and reaction pertaining to thoracic tumours we will elaborate on each of these three critical components. Photosensitisers (PSs): By deﬁnition these are natural or synthetic substances that can create, what is termed, a ‘‘type II photochemical reaction’’. The end result is creation of singlet oxygen species which is a highly toxic free radical that can destroy cellular function. PSs may also create a type I reaction which results in toxic peroxidation. As will be detailed, many PS may also ﬂuoresce which plays a great role in thoracic PDT [2–6]. 186 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison Whilst thousands of structures may behave as a PS, only a handful have been approved for use in clinical PDT. Most are derivatives of porphyrins or dyes, both of which allow for high production of the type II reaction and generally also for ﬂuorescence capability. For thoracic PDT several PS have become commercially available [2]. Potential beneﬁts and consequences for these PS in thoracic PDT are now brieﬂy detailed. • Photofrin: This is the oldest and most common PS and remains the standard against which all newer PS are compared. Photofrin is a mixture of various hematoporphyrins and is available worldwide. The drug is infused, usually at 2 mg/kg, in an outpatient setting. About 48 h is allowed for the PS to con- centrate in the tumour and clear normal tissue. Then illumination may be undertaken with highly reliable ablation of lesions within the treatment region. Photofrin is not the most rapid producer of the type II reaction so clinical treatment time is about 10–20 min per lesion. The treatment is generally painless. Unfortunately, Photofrin remains in most tissues, including the skin, for 4–6 weeks post infusion so sunlight precautions are critical to prevent severe sunburn during this period. • MACE: This is a synthetic chlorin (plant porphyrin) that produces a high level of reaction so that treatment time can be only a few minutes. The drug also achieves high levels of tumour concentration only a few hours after infusion meaning that treatment can occur on the same day, which is very convenient. Photosensitivity remains for several weeks. Usually 3 mg/kg is infused. • Foscan: This synthetic chlorin is the most potent of the current photosensitizers, where treatment of only a minute or two per lesion is required. However, because it is so potent, reﬂected light may have enough energy to activate the PS which can lead to treatment of inappropriate anatomy. Importantly, after the drug is infused into the patient, even room light may cause a severe photo- sensitivity reaction in exposed skin. Patients must, therefore, be kept in a dark room for the ﬁrst 24 h after PS infusion (0.15 mg/kg). Treatment initiates about 4 days (96 h) post infusion. The treatment itself is relatively painful and anaesthesia should be considered. • ALA: This is a pro-drug that is enzymatically converted to an active PS: PPIX. ALA has found utility in PDT since it can be formulated as a cream for skin PDT or as a pill for systemic PDT. In cream form ALA does not penetrate tissue deeply so it is an excellent therapy for superﬁcial cutaneous lesions. Treatment can be the same day as cream application, but 24–48 h is required for systemic therapy (20 mg/kg oral dose). ALA can also be very painful during illumination. Light Sources [7]: Each PS has its own characteristic intensity (ﬂuence) and wavelength for activation; these are not interchangeable. Therefore, appropriate illumination equipment is required for each particular photosensitizer. The PS used in thoracic oncology activates in the red light spectrum (600 nm or greater). Red light penetrates tissues to perhaps 1 cm or more; so many endobronchial, oesophageal and cutaneous lesions are amenable to PDT illumination though those that are bulky may require several PDT sessions for treatment success. As will be 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 187 discussed, the light source may also be implanted into a bulky tumour. The goal in all cases is to achieve the correct intensity of light to the entire tumour, so that the PS can be activated for lesion destruction. However, the clinician does not want to illuminate regions without tumour as this will result in excess morbidity. Cur- rently, light delivery comes in two categories. First are ﬁbreoptics with diffusing tips which illuminate in all directions. Second are microlens ﬁbreoptics which are forward illuminating, like a ﬂashlight. Depending on availability and the clinical situation either or both ﬁbreoptics may be employed in treatment. The light source itself may vary from intense incandescent or ﬂuorescent bulbs to lasers. Currently, lasers are preferred as they can offer the optimal intensity and wavelength of light tuned to a particular PS. Recently, light emitting diodes, which are less expensive, have become available for many photosensitizers. Photodynamic Reaction: This is the accumulation of light energy transfer to the photosensitizer. Upon successful activation by appropriate light energy and wavelength the PS will produce singlet oxygen. These singlet oxygen species are highly destructive. Tumour cell membranes and organelle membranes will be injured or destroyed leading to programmed cell death (apoptosis) and/or necrosis. In both cases tumour tissue can be eradicated but, clinically, the mechanism of cell death may be of importance. [4–6] Apoptotic death results in tumour dissolution with re-absorption. In contrast, necrotic death pathways result in release of cellular contents which may lead to cytokine release and immune response. This may have ramiﬁcations as this regional and immune response may lead to additional normal tissue injury, termed the bystander response. Similarly, singlet oxygen will also injure and destroy vascular membranes as the PS also accumulates here. This will lead to rapid loss of blood ﬂow, stasis and clotting. The loss of blood supply will signiﬁcantly enhance the ability of PDT to achieve complete ablation of tumour. PS also accumulates, though to a lesser degree, in surrounding normal tissue. Therefore, it is critical to minimise illumination to these regions in order to avoid normal tissue injury. In clinical reality this is almost impossible to do as tumour and normal tissues intercalate. Yet by accurate and focal illumination normal tissue injury can be minimised. Upon illumination the PDR occurs rapidly. During treatment, visible lesions turn dusky, hypoxic and often leak exudate. At the completion of the illumination session the physician should have visual conﬁrmation of these changes. Normal surrounding tissue will also react, but less briskly. Signiﬁcant tumour and normal tissue slough are a possibility, followed by healing. This tissue slough is generally of little consequence, except endobronchially when tissue slough can lead to pulmonary obstruction. To prevent this, all patients must undergo repeat bron- choscopy 48 h post PDT for pulmonary toilet [8, 9]. Fluorescent Detection: As the PS loses energy it can emit detectable light, termed ﬂuorescence. Intentionally, ﬂuorescing the PS by using lower energy light is termed ﬂuorescent detection or photodiagnosis (PD). As PS accumulates in tumour, by intentionally ﬂuorescing the tumour region it is possible to better demarcate lesions as well as detect lesions that were not visually obvious. Fluo- rescence is, therefore, a useful clinical tool to improve PDT both by localising the 188 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison regions to illuminate and also avoiding regions not requiring PDT. Further, loss of ﬂuorescence after PDT treatment is correlated with treatment success and is thus a good means to assess if a lesion requires additional PDT after initial treatment illumination [4–6]. Clinical Procedure: For all patients it is extremely important to understand that skin photosensitivity initiates at PS application, not treatment. Patients who cannot abide by photosensitivity precautions should not be offered PDT. As light source placement is critical to success, this is generally the most difﬁcult aspect of PDT. Endobronchial or oesophageal lesions may be treated endoscopically in the vast majority of cases. The clinician should illuminate the entire lesion with as homogeneous an illumination as possible. Under-illumination will not create a sufﬁcient PDR for success. Over-illumination may lead to unnecessary morbidity particularly to nearby normal tissues. For non-bulky lesions the clinicians may, if possible, choose between a diffuser and microlens. The lens may be focused on the tumour, minimising normal tissue illumination. [10, 11] The diffuser usually will lie over the tumour regions. Whilst this will maximise tumour illumination it also exposes surrounding normal tissues to the full light dose. In bulky lesions illumination may be more difﬁcult due to anatomical issues. Here, diffusing ﬁbres are often used inserted into the tumour mass to illuminate from the inside out. As most diffuser ﬁbres will break upon excessive pressure, in these situations the tumour may be ‘‘opened’’ by tools such as the biopsy needle or use of laser to core an opening. More peripheral lesions may be approached endobronchially by using magnetic guidance or through a VATS procedure. In all cases the concept is to try to bring the treatment light to an appropriate position to illuminate the tumour bed [12, 13]. Diffuse regions such as mesothelioma may require additional expertise for appropriate illumination. In these situations multiple lesions of fairly large volume may be treated, therefore, multiple lasers may be required. Further, to improve light distribution additional substances such as emulsion may be applied. This is further described in the Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) Sect. 9.5.6. Cutaneous lesions occurring in the chest wall have many treatment options. PDT can play a role since it can ablate lesions of various histologies including metastatic tumours. In each instance it is important to ensure that all lesions are homogeneously illuminated. As some patients may have 30–40 lesions, a system to ensure this, as well as the appropriate equipment is critical. This is further described in the chest wall involvement by local recurrence of breast cancer, of this text [14, 15]. It must be emphasised that in clinical situations the tools and parameters to assess the results of PDT are not similar to those which are used in the laboratory or even in some in vivo experiments which effectively measures PDR. That is to say that, in practice, laboratory and experimental work may not translate to the outcome in patients. 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 189 9.3 Lung Cancer (Bronchial carcinoma) 9.3.1 Introduction Lung cancer has been one of the most important therapeutic challenges of the twentieth century. The development of pulmonary surgery culminating in the ﬁrst pneumonectomy by Graham and Singer in 1933 [16] was hailed as the road to a new era of lung cancer treatment which could lead, it was hoped, to reversal of the poor outcome of the disease known for centuries. Unfortunately, in the following years, this proved not to be the case. In 2008 some 1.6 million people were diagnosed as having lung cancer in the world. In the same year 1.3 million died from the disease [17]. Advances in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, referred to as standard cancer treatments, in the past 50 years have not translated to a signiﬁcant amelioration of the outcome for lung cancer sufferers. Clearly, new methods of detection and a change of treatment ethos must seriously be considered in order to improve the situation. 9.3.2 Development of Broncho-Pulmonary Cancer It is generally acknowledged that lung cancer develops in a stepwise fashion. This implies that, in response to different carcinogens, gradual aberrations occur in the molecular and genetic makeup of normal broncho-pulmonary cells. Initially, these changes are not reﬂected in the morphology of the affected cells. Continuation of carcinogenic exposure leads to microscopic morphological alterations of the affected cells at ﬁrst characterised by ‘‘metaplasia’’. The next gradual steps in carcinogenesis become a crescendo of abnormal changes of the morphology and aggressive cell division from metaplasia, through various grades of dysplasia, to carcinoma in situ. As the name suggests, carcinoma in situ is a localised and superﬁcial neoplastic lesion of bronchial epithelia which, as yet, has not penetrated deep below the mucosal surface. Deeper involvement beyond the epithelial surface results in yet further deterioration of the cells and tissues subjected to carcino- genesis. Local invasion and expansion results in lymphatic and extra pulmonary metastatic involvement and true generalised neoplastic disease. This sequence of events, initiated with molecular changes of the cells and ending with full blown invasive cancer and generalised neoplastic disease, has important diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. Firstly, at the earliest stage of molecular events and even in the dysplastic morphological stages, cessation of the carcinogenic stimulus and local treatment can allow reversal of the process and a return to normal. At carcinoma in situ and local invasion stage interventional bronchoscopic methods speciﬁc to cancer, including lasers and PDT, may eradicate the disease. The success of local therapy methods, including surgical resection, becomes improbable as the tumour crosses the boundaries of ‘‘localness’’. 190 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison An early diagnosis of molecular changes can be made using molecular/genetic methods identifying ‘‘markers’’. There are as yet no speciﬁc and reliable molecular markers for the early detection of lung cancer. However, bronchial pre and early neoplastic morphological changes may be visualised through bronchoscopic examination, particularly when a ﬂuorescence method (autoﬂuorescence bron- choscopy—AFB) is used instead of ordinary white light bronchoscopy [18, 19]. Standard bronchoscopic examination of the bronchial tree uses an electric generated (white) light which can reveal a tumour when it causes a raised mass of 2–3 mm. In contrast AFB, using a monochromatic light in the region of blue- ultraviolet wavelength, has several times more possibility of localising a superﬁ- cial lesion, such an intra epithelial neoplasia and carcinoma in situ [18, 20] (Fig 9.1a, b, c, d). 9.3.3 Classiﬁcation of Lung Cancer Classiﬁcation is a way of grouping different types of lung cancer into categories, allowing understanding and providing a universal language for communication amongst scientists and clinicians. Fig. 9.1 a Appearance of normal bronchial mucosa at white light bronchoscopy. b Appearance of same area using ﬂuorescence light (note homogenous green). c Appearance of left lower lobe bronchial mucosa at white light bronchoscopy. d Appearance of same area using ﬂuorescence light (note reddish brown colour of early cancer) 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 191 • Histological classiﬁcation [21]: Lung cancers are classiﬁed according to their histological characteristics. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recognises principal histological types, squamous-cell carcinoma, adeno-carcinoma, large cell and small cell varieties. The three main histological types, other than small cell carcinoma, are collectively referred to as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). • Topographical classiﬁcation: This is based on the area within the lung where the tumour has initially originated. In this respect some tumours (60 %) start within the airway (bronchial tree) and these are known as central type tumours. Some other tumours initiate in the substance of the lung; these are known as peripheral lung cancer (Fig. 9.2a, b). • Stage (TNM) classiﬁcation [22]: This is the most important of all classiﬁcations which arranges the cancer according to size and extent of local and distant spread and then attempts to correlate these parameters to survival outcome within a given treatment spectrum. By convention the stage classiﬁcation uses acronyms: T (for tumour) its size and location graded by numbers 1–4, N (for lymph node involvement) and numbered from 1 to 3 according to location in the chest and M (for distant metastases) numbered according to their location and numbered 1–3. TNM classiﬁcation allows clinicians and pathologists to place a given cancer within a chart and give a rough prognosis; thus, bringing about a universal understanding. For instance a patient with a T4, N2, M2 lung cancer indicates an advanced cancer locally with serious lymph node spread and metastatic component. Fig. 9.2 Peripheral lung cancer: a diagram, b chest x-ray appearance 192 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison 9.4 PDT for Lung Cancer After a long period of gestation and much laboratory work, clinical PDT emerged from the laboratory and became a therapeutic reality; in fact, it was over 30 years ago that the Japanese thoracic surgeon Hyata and colleagues at the Tokyo Medical University [23] carried out the ﬁrst bronchoscopic PDT in a patient with early stage bronchial carcinoma who was otherwise unﬁt for surgical resection. The patient survived over 4 years, completely cancer free, and died from unrelated causes. During the 1980s and 1990s a considerable volume of work was carried out throughout the world. These clinical studies were responsible to deﬁne the indi- cations and reﬁne the methodology. 9.4.1 PDT Indications in Lung Cancer Traditionally, at least during the past 60 years, the standard treatment for lung cancer has been formulated under the trio of surgery, radiotherapy and chemo- therapy, solo or in concert. Progress in science and technology has allowed a number of newer methods to enter into the ﬁeld of therapy of which the most promising in the past 25–30 years has been PDT. It must be emphasised that PDT, like surgery, is essentially a local therapy and its use in lung cancer should be considered as local ablation of the tumour. It can, however, be used in conjunction with chemo-radiation to achieve local and general effects just as is the case for surgical resection of cancer. PDT indications in lung cancer are: 1. In locally advanced endobronchial tumours. In such cases an endobronchial exophytic tumour causes collapse of an entire lung, or a major part of it, through blockage of the air conducting system. The role of PDT in these cases is to necrose the tumour allowing opening of the blocked airway [7, 24]. 2. In early stage superﬁcial endobronchial cancers in patients ineligible for sur- gical resection. PDT is used in such cases with curative intent [10, 25, 26]. 3. In recurrent or metachronous tumours after previous major lung resection. This is an important indication of PDT since neither further surgery nor chemo- radiation would be of beneﬁt, even if the patient was otherwise ﬁt. This is because residual pulmonary function is impaired proportionally to the extent of the resection. Likewise, chemo-radiation, by inﬂicting collateral injury to the normal lung, further compromises the already impaired pulmonary function. 4. In peripheral lung tumours when the patient is unﬁt or unwilling to undergo surgical resection including minimal access surgery such as Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) [12, 13]. 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 193 9.4.2 Methodology • Pre-sensitisation: For all lung cancers, pre-sensitisation is carried out by IV administration of the drug. The PS licenced and most commonly used (at least in the western world) is Photofrin\u0003 (Porﬁmer Sodium). • Illumination: Two types of illumination are used: (a) Interstitial in which the cylindrical diffuser of the delivery ﬁbre is placed within the mass of the tumour (Fig. 9.3). (b) Surface illumination in which light exposure is carried out by placing the diffuser in proximity of the lesion (for example within the lumen of the bronchus). Alternatively, a delivery ﬁbre with a forward projection is used (microlens) (Fig. 9.4). The methodology in practice is summarised in Fig. 9.5 Bronchoscopic PDT is carried out under general anaesthetic using the rigid and/ or ﬂexible bronchoscope. The delivery ﬁbre is introduced through the biopsy channel of the ﬂexible bronchoscope Fig. 9.6 [7, 24, 27]. For bulky tumours the interstitial method of illumination is used employing 630 nm laser light. After appropriate exposure (standard of 200 J/cm) clearing is carried out. This involves removal of the necrotic tissues and debris followed by thorough bronchial washing with saline solution. For superﬁcial, early stage endobronchial tumours, surface illumination is used delivering 150–200 J/cm of the lesion according to thickness of the tumour (if this is known by imaging). Such patients with early cancer are usually submitted to surgical resection which is considered as the treatment of choice when their general condition and pulmonary function allow the undertaking. About 2–3 h after recovery from the anaesthetic the patient can be discharged from the hospital.

Symptomatic relief, both in terms of improvement in breathing and reduction of dyspnoea index, discontinuation of repeated chest infection, haemoptysis, cough and haemptysis. Symptomatic improvement is proportionate to re-canalisation of the airway, clearing of chest x-ray and improved spirometry [7, 23, 27, 28]. • Early superﬁcial: There are a number of publications clearly indicating that in early neoplastic endobronchial lesions, long-term complete remission/response follows bron- choscopic PDT. Japanese clinicians, who from the start concentrated their efforts on treating such early cancers, offer PDT in selected patients as the primary treatment of choice on par with surgery. In effect they show that the results of PDT compare with the best results of surgical resection in patients with early stage endobronchial tumours [25, 27]. Other workers, including this author, demonstrate that 5 years survival in such tumours is 65–67 % [10]. However, if the non-cancer deaths were to be taken into consideration the ﬁgure reaches to 70 %. In a highly selected patient population an 80 % ﬁve years survival has been reported [29, 30]. • Peripheral lung cancer: There is not much experience in the use of PDT in the substance of the lung. Such tumours cannot be accessed for illumination bronchoscopically. Some authors have used a trans-cutaneous approach under CT imaging [12]. Our group, with a small number of cases, advocates using a thoracoscopic approach under vision [13]. 9.5 PDT for Cancer of the Oesophagus and Barrett’s Dysplastic Mucosal Lesions 9.5.1 Introduction Cancer of the oesophagus is one of the most distressing conditions which, worldwide, affects nearly 462,000 people annually and causes death in some 406,500 [17]. At its early stage, the condition escapes diagnosis since its initial symptoms are non-speciﬁc and, in many, by the time the disease is suspected and diagnosed, surgical resection and reconstruction, which is the treatment of choice, cannot be applied with curative intent. In effect over 50 % of cases are inoperable at presentation and of these at most 20 % will have an early stage cancer suitable 196 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison for surgery with curative intent [31]. However, 75–80 % of patients with stage I (mucosal cancer) could have a chance of 5 years or more survival when operated by an experienced team. [32–34]. Over the past 50 years the standard method of treatment for oesophageal cancer has been formulated, by tradition and experience, to be the trio of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in different combinations. In the absence of a validated screening programme for early detection, and despite the considerable advances in diagnostic methods, and in each of the three standard treatment methods, the outcome from the patient’s perspective has hardly changed and remains poor. For every 100 patients diagnosed, only 10–15 will have a chance of surviving more than 5 years. However, the concerns and problems for clinicians involved in the treatment of oesophageal cancer, do not totally relate to early diagnosis of the disease for which surgical resection remains the mainstay of therapy. Therapeutic and management problems relate to ﬁnding the best therapy which can be applied to the overall majority of patients who, at presentation, are at an advanced stage of the disease which is not oncologically suitable for operation, and for the cohorts who are oncologically suitable for surgical treatment but otherwise inoperable because of their general condition and/or comorbidity. In the mid twentieth Century a number of minimally invasive methods of treating cancer of the oesophagus became available with the aim of relieving dysphagia, which is distressing and eventually responsible for nutritional deﬁ- ciencies. Being unable to swallow solids or liquids and, in the course of time even saliva, for patients with advanced oesophageal cancer is distressing enough. The inability to ingest medications (including analgesics) is an added therapeutic problem not shared with many other equally distressing cancers. From its inception PDT became one of the important methods of therapy for patients with severe dysphagia caused by the protrusion of tumour into the oesophageal lumen. Although PDT was initially used for symptom relief in these patients, in the course of time a number of other indications of PDT for oesoph- ageal cancer evolved. 9.5.2 Current Indications of PDT in Oesophageal Cancer PDT indications in oesophageal cancer are: 1. Locally advanced disease. 2. Early stage cancer. 3. Miscellaneous indications of PDT in Oesophageal cancer. 9.5.2.1 PDT in Locally Advanced Cancer of the Oesophagus This concerns cases in which the tumour presents as a mass protruding within the lumen of some part of the oesophagus causing dysphagia (swallowing difﬁculties) 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 197 of different scales, usually III–IV (I being difﬁculty with solids and IV being total dysphagia even to saliva) [35]. Many such patients will have lymph node involvement and possibly metastases in the liver and other organs. The primary aim of treatment is palliation of dysphagia allowing patients to swallow normal consistency food or at least up to and including semi-solids. 9.5.2.2 PDT for Early Stage Cancer Patients with early oesophageal cancer usually do not have endoluminal lesions; therefore, they do not present with dysphagia at the initial phase of the develop- ment of their tumour. In fact they may be asymptomatic and have been diagnosed in the course of investigations for indistinct upper gastro-intestinal tract symptoms, perhaps during a fortuitous endoscopy and biopsy for a different condition. In the normal way such patients are good subjects for resectional surgery following further investigation. Nevertheless, oesophagectomy is a major undertaking and some patients will be ineligible for the surgical treatment. In this cohort of patients, PDT has an important indication and is a worthwhile undertaking [36]. 9.5.2.3 Miscellaneous Indications of PDT in Oesophageal Cancer This group includes a number of heterogeneous indications: (a) Local recurrence at the site of anastomosis after oesophagectomy and recon- struction of the upper alimentary tract. (b) PDT for blockage of oesophageal stent by tumour re-growth. (c) PDT as salvage for local failure after chemo-radiation therapy (RCT). 9.5.3 Methodology [37, 38] • Pre-sensitisation: Review of the literature indicates that an overall majority of clinicians consider that the preferred methodology for PDT of oesophageal cancer is systemic (IV) administration of PS followed by laser light illumina- tion. Most clinicians, including the authors, use Photofrin (Porﬁmer sodium) which is administered 24–72 h prior to endoscopic illumination. Photofrin is activated by 630 nm light which is delivered through an optical ﬁbre, endo- scopically delivered. • Endoscopic Illumination: (a) For most locally advanced tumours with a bulky mass of exophytic lesion, the interstitial method of illumination is carried out (Fig 9.6). Using this method the cylindrical diffusing end of the light delivery ﬁbre is inserted into the mass of tumour. This permits a regular delivery of the light within a radius of 7–10 mm. 198 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison In cases where the mass of the tumour is involved circumferentially in the oesophageal wall, illumination will have to be intraluminal as shown in Fig. 9.6. Experience has shown that a light dose of 200 Joules/cm is appropriate for optimal illumination. This is made up of 400 mW for the length of the lesion. (b) Illumination for superﬁcial mucosal lesions is usually carried out via intra- luminal illumination. Although the standard dose is indicated by many of the clinicians and scientists to be 200 J/cm of the lesion, in practice this can be 100–150 J/cm of lesion as, in most cases, there are planned or unplanned areas of illumination overlap. Whilst clearly it is possible to perform endoscopic illumination in patients under topical anaesthetic and sedation, we prefer to carry out the procedure under general anaesthetic. This allows better control by the operator and focusing on the illumination process rather than the comfort of the patient. Oesophagoscopic PDT is usually undertaken as a day case procedure. 9.5.4 Results of Endoscopic PDT for Oesophageal Cancer Adverse events: • Death attributed to PDT is extremely rare. • Uncommon adverse events reported in the literature are pain and oesophagitis which may last for a few days leading to ulceration and haemorrhage. • Haemorrhage, requiring blood transfusion, and perforation are extremely rare. • Photosensitivity skin reaction (burn) is the commonest of the adverse events. However, the incidence is dependent of the type of the PS used and the level of experience and management skill of the PDT team. On the whole Photofrin needs a lengthier clearance time from the body and skin than ALA. However, the range of photosensitivity skin reaction reported in the literature for Photo- frin\u0003 PDT is reported to be between 0 and [35 %. At the Yorkshire Laser Centre, where the majority of PDT cases use Photofrin\u0003, photosensitivity in its milder form has never been [5 % and for the past 2–3 years was 0 %. • Stricture formation is the most serious of complications. Its incidence is reported to be higher in patients undergoing PDT with the use of Photofrin\u0003 (about 23 %) than for ALA (about 8 %). The records of the YLC related to stricture following PDT in early cancer and Barrett’s mucosa with HGD stands at 8 %. 9.5.4.1 Results in Locally Advanced Disease The aim of these cases is palliation of symptoms, essentially that of dysphagia. Necrosis of the obstructing tumour allows recanalisation thus permitting amelio- ration of swallowing. Figure 9.7 shows the change of dysphagia scale 6 weeks 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 199 after endoscopic PDT in large series of patients [37, 39, 40]. The relief of dys- phagia is accompanied by improvement in performance status and nutritional status of patients. Although only a small proportion of patients with bulky endo- luminal tumour will have complete response in the pathological sense, with macroscopic and microscopic evidence of clearance of the tumour, after endo- scopic PDT the majority have important partial response allowing the passage of solid and liquid through the oesophagus to the stomach. Objectively this can be shown by endoscopic examination and contrast study. 9.5.4.2 Results of Endoscopic PDT in Early Stage Cancer The aim of PDT in early stage cancer as previously stated is survival beneﬁt, a true oncological treatment of an early stage cancer in patients who are ineligible for surgical resection. This is an area of increasing interest since oesophagectomy, which is the prime option for such patients, may not be a practical proposition for some whose general condition puts them into the category of inoperability because of the prohibitive risk of surgery in their case. Personal experience and the review of the relevant literature indicate that PDT can achieve the expected long survival [41, 42]. In a group of 40 patients with clinical stage I oesophageal cancer who were ineligible for surgical resection on account of high operative risk and important co-morbidity, over 50 % survived 5 years or more; if non-cancer mortality were to taken into account, the ﬁgure rose to over 60 %. Similar results have been reported by other authors [42–44]. 9.5.4.3 Miscellaneous Indications of PDT (a) Local recurrence after oesophagectomy and reconstruction can be due to a variety of reasons, such as microscopic involvement of the oesophageal margin of resection, pre-existing high grade dysplasia (HGD) degeneration to Fig. 9.7 Changes in dysphagia scale resulting from endoscopic PDT in locally advanced cancer of the oesophagus 200 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison carcinoma, co-existence of cancer with HGD, missed or misinterpreted biopsy specimen, and true de novo development of tumour at the site of the anasto- mosis. All large published series show a few of such cases which can pose therapeutic dilemma [31, 45–48]. PDT is a suitable method of therapy for these patients. (b) PDT for blockage of oesophageal stent by tumour re-growth: Over and under growth of tumour above or below the stent is not unusual. Not is in-growth of tumour within the coils of some uncovered stents. In either circumstance, PDT is a very suitable method to be used for re-canalisation of the lumen of the stent [39, 41]. (c) PDT as salvage for local failure after chemo-radiation therapy: this concerns two categories of patients: • Patients who are offered chemotherapy to down-stage their cancer prior to surgery. A number of such patients, either by intention or due to deterioration of their general, haematological and/or nutritional state cannot complete the treatment, or even the chemotherapy part of the package. These patients are difﬁcult to treat and PDT is another indication which can help at least some with better quality of life (QOL) and survival. • Some patients with early cancer are offered, or opt to have CRT instead of or in addition to surgery. Failure of treatment means that they are at risk of expansion or upgrade of the cancer to higher stage. PDT is shown to be an effective mode of therapy in such patients [49, 50]. 9.5.5 PDT in Barrett’s Oesophagus 9.5.5.1 Introduction Barrett’s oesophagus refers to a condition in which a variable length of the mucosal lining of the lower part of the oesophagus (over 3 cm above the gastro- oesophageal junction) is covered by columnar epithelium of either gastric or intestinal type instead of the usual squamous variety (Fig. 9.8). Norman Barrett, a British thoracic surgeon, who initially described the condition, thought that the abnormal mucosa was congenital in origin [51]. It later became apparent that the abnormal mucosal lining was an acquired occurrence resulting from gastro- oesophageal reﬂux [52, 53]. When such a columnar (metaplastic) epithelial-lined mucosa is repeatedly exposed to gastric content with its high acid component, by episodes of gastro-oesophageal reﬂux, mucosal injuries characterised by inﬂam- mation, ulceration and scarring may develop. In some cases, over time, the injured cells of the mucosa start a stepwise morphological pattern with parallel behav- ioural changes. These changes are referred to as dysplasia which can be of different degree; namely low, moderate and high grade. Morphological and 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 201 histological crescendo changes are akin to what have already been described in the section of lung cancer under Development of Lung cancer. In short, Barrett’s metaplastic mucosa is predisposed to changes which could progress to HGD. In terms of cellular abnormalities this approaches an early cancer (adenocarcinoma) of the oesophagus. It is generally accepted that patients with metaplastic Barrett’s mucosa have a slightly higher risk of developing oesophageal cancer than the normal population. However, by the time the mucosal transformation reaches to HGD, the possibility of cancer formation is considerably greater. Indeed, based on experience, some authors [45–48, 54] including these authors, believe that 30–40 % of patients diagnosed with Barrett’s mucosa with HGD are harbouring an early intra-mucosal or even sub-mucosal cancer. It, therefore, follows that many surgeons consider that persistence of HGD in a long segment of Barrett’s mucosa warrants investigation and oesophagectomy and reconstruction of the oesophagus. Others argue that such a major undertaking is only justiﬁed in cases showing histologically proven characteristics of cancer in a biopsy sample. The advent of PDT as an oncological therapeutic method has only expanded the debate. 9.5.5.2 Indications of PDT in Barrett’s Oesophagus It is generally agreed that patients with metaplastic mucosa but without HGD should be followed up by endoscopic surveillance and treated with anti-reﬂux medication and/or surgical procedure to prevent continuing reﬂux of the gastric content into the oesophagus with its unpleasant symptomology. Without an anti- reﬂux procedure, the frequency of such surveillance is debatable. In the case of Barrett’s mucosa with HGD, therapeutic opinions are divided. Many experienced surgeons would opt for surgical resection and reconstruction of Fig. 9.8 Left oesophagoscopic appearance of metaplastic Barrett’s mucosa (white area normal squamous epithelial oesophageal mucosa, red area metaplastic columnar mucosa). Right histology of a biopsy showing metaplastic intestinal Barrett’s mucosa 202 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison the oesophagus in young and ﬁt patients, arguing that Barrett’s Mucosa with HGD is a carcinoma in waiting if it is not already a cancer [45, 46]. Others believe that it is unjustiﬁable to undertake the major operation of oesophagectomy, with its operative mortality and post-operative morbidity, ignoring considerable advances made in recent years in endoscopic therapeutic methods. Should the operative strategy be adopted, surgery should be undertaken by a team with experience and high throughput [54]. They prefer to resort to suppression of gastric acid content by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication and continuing surveillance. PDT has introduced a third therapeutic option allowing a high proportion of patients to be treated endoscopically. The personal experience of these authors suggests that: • One should consider the surgical option in a ﬁt patient with HGD associated with long standing Barrett’s mucosa. Alternatively, in such a patient, one could carry out one endoscopic PDT cycle and later re-evaluate the situation endo- scopically and with appropriate imaging (CT scan). • Depending on the level of response to endoscopic PDT, one may continue with a further cycle if downgrading of dysplasia has occurred. • When, and if, there is no change in the grading of dysplasia, surgical resection should be considered unless there is a high risk of operative mortality and/or post-surgical morbidity such that affects the QOL. 9.5.5.3 Methodology • Pre-sensitisation: Photofrin\u0003 is the most frequently employed PS in BO. It is administered at the dose of 2 mg/kg body weight intravenously. 5-ALA has been used by some investigators in varying dose 20–60 mg/kg body weight taken orally. Foscan (mTHpc) has also been tried in a small number of patients at the dose 0.15 mg/kg/bw [55]. • Illumination: Light is delivered via an optical ﬁbre which is placed into the lumen. Some authors use a nude diffuser end of the optical ﬁbre directly into the lumen. Others use a fabricated balloon or applicators which have been tested in respect of their light transmission. The light dose depends on the type of applicator and the PS being used as well as the experience of the operator. 9.5.5.4 Results Complete response: Eradication of HGD is the aim of all endoscopic procedures including PDT with whichever PS. Review of the literature places the success rate in large series between 20 and 77 % after a year. Despite many trials, randomised or otherwise, the position of PDT in Barrett’s mucosa with HGD must be viewed as a method 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 203 which can be used in selected patients by clinicians experienced with all aspects of the treatment of the condition. In the absence of convincing evidence, the choice of PS should be that with which the operating practitioner is familiar and can achieve the best results and used in the context of clinical trials protocol. Finally, on the subject of Barrett’s mucosa, we believe that since metaplastic mucosa is in the ﬁrst place produced by gastro-oesophageal reﬂux, an anti-reﬂux operation and/or non-surgical mechanism should always be considered as part of the endoscopic treatment package. 9.5.6 PDT in Diffuse Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma 9.5.6.1 Introduction The pleura is a thin membrane which envelops the lung, covering its external surface (visceral pleura) and then reﬂects on itself as one continuous sheet to cover the inner surfaces of the chest wall (parietal pleura). It is smooth and shiny and its function is to facilitate movement of the lungs during respiration and to prevent friction when the lungs change their volume and come into contact with the chest wall during inspiration and expiration. Diffuse MPM is a slow growing tumour which arises from mesothelial cells which, in turn, are the basic structural cells of the pleura. The tumour spreads locally in all directions to involve the whole of the pleural membrane of the inner chest wall (parietal pleura) as well as the outer surfaces of the lung (visceral pleura) (Fig. 9.9). Distant metastases are uncommon. MPM is essentially a local Fig. 9.9 Left schematic diagram showing the involvement of the right lung and the inner left chest wall by diffuse malignant pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). Right thoracoscopic view of the pleural space showing involvement of the chest wall (bottom) and the lung involvement (top)by MPM 204 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison disease and the cause of death usually relates to respiratory insufﬁciency. The characteristic gross appearance of the ‘‘en bloc’’ pleura-pulmonary resection or post-mortem specimen is one of encasement of a compressed lung beneath a thick and rigid sheet of tumour resembling a spongy cake (the lung) covered all around by thick layers of icing (pleural tumour). The disease is usually caused by exposure to asbestos dust or ﬁbres and manifests itself after a long period (sometimes [30 years) after exposure. Its insidious evolution over many months makes early diagnosis an incidental ﬁnding based on a high index of suspicion. Symptoms are gradual, initially presenting with increasing shortness of breath due to the development of diffusely thickened pleural membrane thus encasing the underlying lung which is practically crushed under the unyielding and hard sheet of mesothelioma. Pleural effusion, associated with pain, appears as the disease progresses. Diagnosis is reached by radiology and biopsy of the pleural membrane and cytological examination of the pleural ﬂuid. Treatment: There is no generally agreed standard treatment for MPM. When treated for symptom relief and with supportive measures, the median survival for a patient with MPM is variously reported to be between 6 and 17 months [55–57] depending on the stage of disease at presentation. Thus far, none of the standard cancer therapy methods, when used in their single modality protocol, have shown to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the outcome of the disease over and above its natural history and what is achieved through non-speciﬁc supportive treatment [58–62]. Therefore, effort is being made to develop multi-modal regimes [63, 64]. Surgical treatment of total or partial de-bulking, forms the fundamental part of multi-modal therapy. Extra pleural pleura-pneumonectomy was introduced in the 1950s. However, surgical operation and adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy have shown to offer survival beneﬁt [65, 66]. Early in the development of PDT, its potential to treat a wide variety of malignant tumours were investigated by Dougherty et al. [67]. Considering that MPM is essentially a localised disease and that PDT is also essentially a local treatment, it seems reasonable to use PDT to treat MPM. 9.5.6.2 Role of PDT in MPM The role of PDT in MPM is evolving and, so far, much effort has been directed towards establishing credible methodology. Review of the literature [68] indicates that PDT has been tried intra-operatively (SURG-IOP-PDT) in conjunction with surgery ± chemo-radiation therapy. In effect all investigators have carried out: a surgical procedure followed by an intra-operative PDT and have introduced chemo-radiation before or following the ‘‘Surgery-PDT duo’’. The basic structure of the Surgery-and Intra-Operative PDT (SURG-IOP-PDT) protocol is based on: 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 205 • Administration of the PS is prior to surgery. • Operation scheduled to be carried out at an optimal time between drug administration and illumination, appropriate to the particular PS. • Surgical operation with the objective of de-bulking; excision of the visible tumour partially or totally macroscopically at operation. A variety of surgical operations have been used within the Surg-IOP-PDT ensemble: partial pleurectomy (decortications), radical pleurectomy (RP), simple pleuro-pneumonectomy (resection of the lung and pleura) en-block, and radical pleuro-pneumonectomy (excision of the lung, pleura, diaphragm, and pericardium). Tri-modality treatment involving radical extra pleural pneumonectomy, radio- therapy and chemotherapy which was championed by Sugarbaker and colleagues [69], has received enthusiastic reception by some thoracic surgeons [70, 71]. However, in the last few years, the idea of Tri-modality has been abandoned by many in favour of the principle of pulmonary parenchyma preservation to which PDT is added with/without chemo-radiation component [68]. Yet it is still with tri- modality treatment that the best survival outcome is achieved, though with the penalty of long hospitalisation and an inferior QOL. Friedberg recently published some interesting results showing that following parenchyma-saving surgery of RP (macroscopic clearance of tumour) and PDT, there is advantage of better QOL than that offered by more radical surgery added to by survival beneﬁt [72, 73]. The struggle to ﬁnd a solution to MPM treatment goes on within and without the framework of PDT. Review of the literature concerned with the use of PDT in MPM [68] and further updates [73] suggest that PDT does have a role for this disease. 9.5.6.3 Methodology Pre-sensitisation: Photofrin\u0003 (Porﬁmer Sodium) has been used most frequently at the dose of 2 mg/kg/bw in a majority of cases. Foscan\u0003 (mTHPC) has also been tried in a few series but with more complications [68]. Illumination: The choice of light source is not an issue since each PS has its deﬁned light with speciﬁc wavelength which activates the PS. However, the major issue resides with the device(s) that can be used to deliver the light and to distribute it within the vast and multi-facetted hemithorax, destroying the tumour and preserving the rest of the structure. Both theoretically and practically, there are a number of major issues to be resolved concerning uniform illumination. In this regard some manufacturers have been working to develop ﬁbreoptic fabrics to better distribute the light within the thorax. 206 K. Moghissi and R. R. Allison Light dose is yet another unresolved issue: The latest in the unceasing efforts to develop PDT in MPM is reﬂected in a recent publication by Friedburg [74] in which 38 patients with MPM underwent RP and intra-operative PDT. A total of 35 also received systemic therapy. The median overall survival for patients with epithelial subtypes of cancer was nearly 3 years. This was despite the fact that these overall survival results did not translate to improved progression-free survival. This might, however, be attributed to the conservation of the lung in patients undergoing RP and IOP, instead of pleura-pneumonectomy. What transpires from a review of the literature is that RP ± IO PDT is attended by survival beneﬁt even when the disease-free period had not been improved. 9.6 PDT for the Chest Wall Recurrence of Breast Cancer PDT is sometimes employed for chest wall recurrence from breast cancer [14, 15]. This usually applies to some patients with a biopsy proven tumour that is actively progressing locally on the chest wall despite previous attempts at salvage with various chemotherapeutics, further surgery and additional radiation therapy. At that point treatment options are very limited. Lesions that are not controlled will enlarge, become painful, fester and ulcerate often with a foul smell, leading to a diminished QOL. PDT may be an option. Amongst the earliest trials with Photofrin PDT were patients with cutaneous recurrence from breast cancer. Various drug and light doses were delivered. It was evident that the usual 2 mg/kg was able to ablate these lesions but wound healing was difﬁcult, probably due to the patient undergoing previous extensive surgery, chemo and radiation. Several investigators then employed lower drug doses; 0.8 mg/kg appeared to offer a high degree of efﬁcacy in terms of lesion ablation and, as important, at this dose wound healing was to be expected. Essentially, for chest wall recurrence from breast cancer, low dose Photofrin PDT replaces a non- healing, tumour-infested wound with a wound that is sterilised of tumour and will eventually heal. It is important to select patients carefully and to evaluate the depth and the extent of cancer inﬁltration. The length of time it takes to heal appears to relate to the volume of tissue requiring PDT as well as the volume of the actual tumour. Often these lesions are multifocal and may become conﬂuent, requiring a large volume of skin to be illuminated. In these cases wound healing may take weeks if not months. Small-deﬁned cutaneous lesions (\\1 cm) can heal rapidly, so earlier intervention will improve the outcome for PDT in this group of patients. Unfor- tunately, most patients are considered for PDT after they have failed all other options and their lesions may be too large for PDT to offer a high chance of 9 Photodynamic Therapy for Thoracic Oncology 207 success. In selected individuals several PDT sessions may be required. Further, for patients who have responded well to PDT but have developed new cutaneous lesions, additional PDT sessions are possible and often successful. As these patients often have multiple and large volumes requiring illumination it is critical to have the appropriate equipment and staff. This might require multiple lasers and microlens available for therapy (Fig. 9.10). With Photofrin PDT these out-patient treatments may stretch many hours and nursing must be available. A means to demarcate the area requiring therapy and also an ability to annotate which areas have been illuminated is also a necessity. A map of the treatment volume, as is often employed in Dermatology, is suggested. Appropriate eye protection for patient and staff is mandatory. Generally, by the end of the PDT sessions, cutaneous lesions take on a dusky appearance and also begin to weep. Within 48 h most lesions appear necrotic. Often an eschar will form over larger volumes of illuminated tissue. In many cases a slow but steady healing will take place. Less intervention to the wounds is best. Most patients should be given a weeks supply of narcotic pain medication, though in many cases after PDT, the chest wall is less painful as the tumours involutes. Given the relative complexity of treatment, the requirement for multiple lasers and stafﬁng issues, chest wall PDT requires a multidisciplinary approach to encompass not only therapy but also the healing of these often extensive, highly symptomatic lesions. The use of PDT for primary treatment of breast cancer is possible but should be part of an IRB approved treatment protocol as this is not considered standard care.

Allison Chapter 10 Photodynamic Therapy for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy Patrycja Nowak-Sliwinska, Michel Sickenberg and Hubert van den Bergh Abstract Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Visudyne\u0002 was the ﬁrst successful therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Clinical tests of PDT for wet AMD surprisingly showed a signiﬁcantly better outcome for patients from Japan, Singapore, and China as compared to the results obtained on Caucasian patients. These differences pointed to the fact that patients with polypoidal cho- roidal vasculopathy (PCV), which is encountered more frequently in people with darker skin, had inadvertently been included among the AMD patients. As these two diseases are difﬁcult to distinguish with the ﬂuorescein angiography used in these trials, the switch to indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) then permitted the more speciﬁc and detailed study of PCV with Visudyne\u0002 therapy. The results of PCV treated with PDT turned out to be very good indeed, even though on the time scale of 1 year or more retreatment was needed in some patients. Anti-VEGF therapy by itself, however, did not show anywhere near the same beneﬁt for treating PCV as was the case for the treatment of wet AMD. Recently, triple therapy with Visudyne\u0002-PDT combined with anti-VEGF therapy and a steroid was found to give the best results for the visual acuity of patients with PCV. This chapter summarizes the data on PDT of PCV, and the effect of different combi- nation therapies. Some of the pathological and genetic similarities and differences between PCV and wet AMD are also discussed.

PDT with Visudyne\u0002 as a photosensitizer was the ﬁrst effective and safe treatment for subfoveal lesions, saving more than a million eyes from blindness. CNV is encountered in patients with AMD, but also occurs in pathologic myopia, inﬂammation, angioid streaks, trauma, and choroidal rupture [2, 3]. Although wet AMD constitutes only a small fraction of AMD, it is the major cause of blindness of the elderly in the western world [4]. CNV often develops in the central part of the macula called the fovea, where the leaking vessels lead to edema, and ﬁnally scar tissue replacing the photoreceptors. The maintenance of healthy macular function is dependent on the integrity of the different layers of the retinal tissue in this region. These include the choroidal blood supply, Bruch’s membrane, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the neural retina containing the photoreceptors, and the network of other cells which preprocess the optical signal before sending it via the ganglion cells, axons, and the optic nerve to the brain. The etiology of CNV secondary to AMD is not completely known. It has been proposed that the photoreceptor outer segments accumulate oxidative stress in the vision process, and then these outher segments are ‘‘partially’’ shed and are replaced. The shed outer segment fragment is then phagocytosed and destroyed by the neighboring RPE cells. Upon aging this process no longer functions optimally, 214 P. Nowak-Sliwinska et al. which leads to deposits of fatty material in and under the RPE. Such deposits, that may show up as colored spots during ophthalmoscopy, are called drusen. The decreased transport of oxygen, liquid, and nutrients through these lipophilic deposits leads to hypoxia, the induction of HIF-1a and VEGF-A and hence neo- angiogenesis and vascular sprouting from the choroid into Bruch’s membrane. Neovessels are frequently restricted to the area below the RPE and near Bruch’s membrane. These are sometimes called ‘‘occult’’ CNV, as in ﬂuorescein angiog- raphy they are more difﬁcult to detect due mainly to the absorption of the exci- tation and emission wavelengths by the melanin in the RPE. However, the choroidal neovessels are sometimes capable of transgressing the RPE [2, 5, 6] thus making them more visible. These may be called ‘‘classic’’ neovessels. The newly formed blood vessels are pathologically and functionally abnormal, leaking lipids, ﬂuid, and blood into the retina causing the edema and retinal thickening which is often associated with vision impairment. If this leakage extends over longer times it can lead to scar tissue in the retina and scotoma, i.e., dark regions in our central vision. The size and number of drusen can be correlated with disease progression and has been used as a predictor for patient outcome [7]. This pathology and its successful treatment by Visudyne\u0002-photodynamic therapy (V-PDT) have been described extensively by our group and others [8–11]. Brieﬂy, V-PDT is a treatment that utilizes the somewhat selective endothelial uptake of a photoactivatable compound in the CNV after i.v. injection of liposomal benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPDMA). Applied ‘‘standard’’ pro- tocol of local light delivery (light dose of 50 J/cm2, irradiance of 600 mW/cm2 of 689 nm light over 83 s) produces a vaso-occlusive effect. Endothelial cell damage begins with the calcium inﬂux into the cell. This provokes alterations in cyto- skeletal components leading to cell shrinkage, loss of tight junctions between endothelial cells, and exposure of the vascular basement membrane [12]. Blood platelet aggregation after irradiation and their interaction with procoagulant extracellular matrix components comes with vessel constriction and eventually leads to thrombus formation [13]. The clinical results of AMD treatment trials involving PDT alone or in combination with other treatment modalities are described in detail elsewhere [14–24] and are summarized in Table 10.1. While comparing the clinical trial results obtained in the identical AMD treat- ment, between Asian and Caucasian patients, it turned out, that the responses to PDT were better for Japanese patients (JAT trial) as compared to Caucasian patients (TAP trial) [25], see Fig. 10.1. Exactly, the same therapy in Japanese patients diagnosed with AMD gave better visual acuity gain then in the Caucasian patients also diagnosed with AMD [26–28]. Historically, with the use of ICGA atypical cases of AMD had been found, with a vascular network that terminates in polyp- oidal lesions. These lesions were called PCV. PCV was recognized for the ﬁrst time in 1982 by Yannuzzi and colleagues as an uncommon hemorrhagic disorder of the macula [29]. Two years later similar changes named ‘‘posterior uveal bleeding syndrome’’ were observed by Kleiner et al. [30]. In 1985, Stern and colleagues characterized multiple, bilateral, serosanguineous retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachments occurring in the posterior segment in black woman [31]. 10 Photodynamic Therapy for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy 215Table10.1SummaryofclinicaltrialswithV-PDTforchoroidalneovascularizationStudyTreatmentregimentFollowupperiod(months)ResultsReferenceTAPStandardﬂuenceV-PDT24V-PDTreducedtheriskofmoderateorseverevisionlossinpatientswithCNVduetoAMD[15]VIPStandardﬂuenceV-PDT(NorthernAmerica,Europe)24Inthev-PDTgroup,VAimprovementbyatleastﬁveletterswasobservedinpatientswithCNVduetopathologicmyopia[14]Lametal.StandardﬂuenceV-PDT(Asianpatients)24MedianVAimprovementwas1.7lines,butthemeannumberofPDTretreatmentsrequiredintheﬁrst2yearswas2.3—lowerthanintheVIPstudy[16]ANCHORRanibizumab(0.3or0.5mg)standardﬂuenceV-PDT12RanibizumabwasclearlysuperiortoPDTwithrespecttobothvisualacuity(VA)andanatomic(lesionsizeandCNVleakage)efﬁcacyoutcomes[18]FOCUSRanibizumab0.5mgmonthly;shaminjectionsmonthly+standardﬂuenceV-PDT24CombinationtherapywasmoreeffectivethanV-PDTaloneandhadalowrateofadverseevents[17]PROTECTSame-daystandardﬂuenceV-PDT+ranibizumab0.5mg12ImprovedVA,lesionswerestabilizedwithminimaltreatmentrequiredaftermonth3[19]MONTBLANCStandardﬂuenceV-PDT;ranibizumab0.5mg12VAimprovementsinthecombinationgrouparenoninferiortoaranibizumabalonewiththreeranibizumabdosesfollowedbyinjectionsonamonthlyregimen[20]DENALIStandardﬂuenceV-PDT+ranibizumab0.5mg;reduced-ﬂuenceV-PDT+ranibizumab0.5mg;ranibizumab0.5mg12DENALIdidnotdemonstratenoninferiorvisualacuitygainforV-PDTcombinationtherapycomparedwithranibizumabmonthlymonotherapy[22](continued) 216 P.

It now became clear that the V-PDT trials on what had been identiﬁed by ﬂuorescein angiography as AMD, had inadvertently included cases of PCV. The darker skinned patients have a higher percentage of PCV then their Caucasian counterparts, and the better visual acuity outcome in the JAT trial was thus mainly associated with more effective treatment of PCV as compared to AMD. 10.2 Clinical Appearance and Diagnosis of Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy PCV was often found to be the main vascular disorder in patients of pigmented races diagnosed with neovascular maculopathies, especially African-Americans and Asians. PCV is remarkably high in the Japanese population. PCV occurs in white patients [33], but to a lesser extent. Japanese clinical studies suggested that 54.7 % of the patients with neovascular AMD also have PCV [34]. This PCV is characterized by a branching vascular network originating from the inner choroid that terminates in polypoidal lesions [29]. The main clinical manifestation of PCV is the presence of serosanguineous RPE detachments in the region of the central macula or around the optic nerve. These lesions may bleed, causing vitreous hemorrhage, which potentially can lead to vision loss. Another feature is the presence of degenerated small arterioles and capillaries with a thickened basement membrane [35]. The polypoidal lesions range from small to large and perfusing Fig. 10.1 Comparison of mean change of the visual acuity with different treatments in wet AMD. ANCHOR trial (PDT+ranibizumab), JAT and TAP trials (PDT). Month zero is the baseline 218 P. Nowak-Sliwinska et al. branching inner choroidal vessels [36]. They are detectable mainly by means of ICGA, since the longer excitation and detection wavelengths, as compared to ﬂuorescein angiography, can penetrate the RPE easier, allowing improved imag- ing. In early phase ICGA, PCV vessels are ﬁlled before retinal vessels and the area around polypoidal vessels remains hypoﬂuorescent. Subsequently, small hyper- ﬂuorescent polyps become visible within the choroid. The late phase ICGA is associated with reversed ﬂuorescence observations as compared to the early phase, i.e., the area surrounding the polypoidal lesions becomes ﬂuorescent and the center of the lesions becomes hypoﬂuorescent. In the very late stages of ICGA, the disappearance of ﬂuorescence from the lesions is observed [37] (Fig. 10.2). Another feature of the PCV is a hyalinization of choroid-based vessels. The latter refers to the replacement of smooth muscle tissue due to elevated intralu- minal pressure or elastin coding gene (ELN) dysfunction [38]. Other histopa- thological features included plasma and/or ﬁbrin exudation [39]. The reason for choroidal hyperpermeability as detected by ICG angiography in PCV is still not well known. High-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, giving a cross-sectional view of the retina and the choroid, showed that the polypoidal structures are located beneath the RPE [33, 40]. Subfoveal choroidal thickness is greater in eyes with choroidal hyperpermeability than that in eyes without it, in both wet AMD and PCV, whereas in eyes without choroidal hyperpermeability, the mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was greater in PCV than that in typical AMD [41]. While the branching vascular network may be quiescent in some cases of PCV, it can remain the main cause of leakage and exudation in other patients. The presence of PCV in one eye generally indicates a high risk for bilateralism [29]. PCV is usually detected only after serosanguineous detachment of the RPE, or vitreous hemorrhage, but with less ﬁbrous scarring compared to CNV [42, 43].

Moreover, it still remains somewhat controversial whether PCV represents a subtype of neovascularized AMD or a completely separate disorder. Both diseases share some similarities, like laterality (bilateral), presence of CNV and some genetic background [44]; however only based on the differences, the proper diagnosis and treatment can be performed (see Table 10.2). Patients with PCV are mostly Asians or African-Americans and on the average they are younger than the patients diagnosed with AMD. Their eyes have considerably less, or even a complete lack, of drusen, which are a characteristic sign of AMD [44]. Although associated with multiple recurrent serosanguineous macular detach- ment, PCV is not linked to signiﬁcant ﬁbrous proliferation as is the case in end- stage neovascular AMD [46]. Choroidal thickness turns out to be different in the two disorders. As identiﬁed using enhanced-depth imaging OCT, i.e., by the measurement of the vertical distance from the Bruch’s membrane to the innermost scleral layer [47], subfoveal choroidal thickness was thicker in the eyes with PCV, in contrast to the thinner choroid observed in eyes with AMD. The relative importance of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenesis stimulator, and of pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), a protein that inhibits angiogenesis, both of which are expressed in choroidal neo- vascular membranes in the eyes with PCV and AMD, also appears to differ between the two diseases. VEGF and PEDF were shown to be strongly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells of the excised subfoveal ﬁbrovascular human CNV tissues [48]. The correlation in the expression of these two factors suggests their importance in the neovascularization process. Although the expression level of VEGF is increased in both pathologies as compared to the healthy eye, the VEGF level in PCV diagnosed eyes was considerable lower than in AMD eyes [49]. The genetics of PCV and AMD has been extensively studied [50, 51]. It was hypothesized that overexpression of high temperature required factor A1 (HTRA1) that controls the integrity of Bruch’s membrane, facilitates the invasion of cho- roidal capillaries [52]. HTRA1 was found to be associated with both disorders, being about two-fold stronger in AMD than in PCV [52] in Asian patients. Another susceptibility gene in PCV seems to be the elastin gene (ELN), which is shown to be more associated with PCV than with AMD [38]. Moreover, the genes of comple- ment factor H (CFH), HTRA1, and complement factor C2 were associated with both AMD, and PCV. The LOC387715 rs10490924, i.e., the gene which codes mitochondrial protein in photoreceptors, was found to be strongly associated with PCV and presented a different distribution in AMD and PCV [53]. LOC387715 rs10490924 correlates with vitreous hemorrhage, and also with the lesion size. 220 P. Nowak-Sliwinska et al. 10.4 Photodynamic Therapy in PCV The most effective treatment for PCV is not yet well established for all cases. Early studies showed positive results using thermal laser photocoagulation [54–56]. Visudyne\u0002-PDT (V-PDT) is clearly a safer treatment modality for subfoveal or juxtafoveal AMD and PCV due to the minimal damage done to the retina, and it has consequently been used very successfully in treating PCV.

The summaries of the studies, which are discussed below, are presented in Table 10.3. A prospective interventional study was performed in Japanese patients [26]. Based on ICGA, 36 eyes (39 %) were diagnosed with PCV and 54 eyes (58 %) with CNV secondary to AMD. Visual recovery after V-PDT was reported to be more favorable for the eyes with PCV (8 letters) than in those with AMD (7.0 letters). The VA improved (15 letters or more) in 6 % of the AMD patients, in 25 % of the PCV patients, and decreased (15 letters or more) in 31 % of the AMD patients and in 8 %, of the PCV patients. At 1-year ﬂuorescein leakage was suppressed in 86 % of the PCV patients and 61 % of the AMD eyes. In conclusion, V-PDT resulted in superior results for treating PCV as compared to CNV sec- ondary to AMD [26]. Spaide et al. [58], in 1 year retrospective review, reported on 16 patients with subfoveal PCV treated with V-PDT. The visual acuity improved in 9 (56.3 %) of the patients, and remained the same in 5 (31.3 %), and decreased in 2 (12.5 %) of the patients. There were no reported long lasting complications after the treatment. The mean change in visual acuity was an improvement of nearly 2.4 lines! Promising results were also found in other studies in Japanese patients at 1 year after standard ﬂuence PDT [27] or reduced-ﬂuence V-PDT [28, 59]. In both studies PCV showed a signiﬁcantly lower PDT frequency and greater improvement in the visual acuity than in the case of AMD, i.e., fewer PDT treatments per year were needed to obtain optimal results in the case of PCV than in the case of wet AMD. The recurrence period of PCV after PDT was clearly signiﬁcantly longer than that in the case of AMD. Even though all polypoidal lesions regress with PDT, its effect on branching does not seem to be permanent and thus recurrence of polypoidal lesions may occur in the long run. Another problem is the heterogeneous localization of the polyps, especially those in the peripapillary area, which is not always easily accessible for the laser light. Finally, repeated PDT may induce persistent cho- roidal atrophy. In another example, during a 3-year follow-up period, a nonrandomized study was conducted involving eyes with newly diagnosed PCV, which were treated exclusively with V-PDT [60]. Patients were submitted to an average of 3.19 treatment sessions. In this study, approximately, 75 % of the treated eyes had no signiﬁcant loss of vision, and 14.8 % showed signiﬁcant improvement in visual acuity. Although the recurrences were frequent (59.3 % of the eyes at 3 years of follow-up), they responded well to retreatment, and were not associated with increased visual acuity loss. Other limitations of PDT are a pigment epithelium detachment or the possibility of a large submacular hemorrhage. Hirami et al. retrospectively reviewed data for 91 eyes of patients who underwent PDT for the treatment of PCV [61]. In this study, during the follow-up period after PDT, postoperative subretinal hemorrhage was seen in 30.8 % of eyes. In 78.6 % of these eyes, the subretinal hemorrhage 222 P. Nowak-Sliwinska et al.

Although visual acuity was the same or increased in 81.8 % of eyes with subretinal hemorrhage alone, it decreased signiﬁcantly in 50.0 % of the eyes with postoperative vitreous hemorrhage. Akaza et al. with a follow-up of 24 months showed regression of the polypoidal lesions in 29 out of 31 eyes (94 %). However, recurrence of polypoidal lesions appeared in 10 of 29 eyes (34 %) and additional PDT was suggested. V-PDT could reduce the size of polypoidal lesions, but did not destroy them completely. Thus, the persistent branching vessels in the network are supposed to be at the origin of the new polypoidal lesions [62]. Similar results were obtained in another study with a follow-up of 19.2 months [63]. After initial V-PDT, the polypoidal lesions regressed in 94 % of eyes, but the branching vascular network remained in all eyes, and increased in size in 42 % of eyes. Summarizing, PDT in CNV demonstrated very positive short- to medium-term results. Retreatment is necessary in many cases, but at a relatively low frequency. The observations reported above prompted the PDT ﬁeld to search for efﬁcient strategies to improve the efﬁciency and selectivity of V-PDT and reduce the treatment burden. 10.5 Combination Therapies in PCV PDT in combination with other treatment modalities for neovascular AMD has been extensively investigated in in vivo models and in clinical trials by our group and by others [13, 64–66]. The closure of unwanted neovasculature by the com- bination of PDT with antiangiogenic compounds to prevent recurrent neovascu- larization, as well as with corticosteroids to prevent inﬂammation may provide an effective multilevel treatment for both AMD and PCV. Unique characteristics in the pathogenesis of PCV contribute to disease development and can be potential targets for intervention. To date, there is limited information on combination therapy for PCV that is refractory to anti-VEGF therapy. The exact role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of PCV remains to be elucidated. However, the recent studies Table 10.3 (continued) Treatment regiment/patient origin Follow up period (months) Results Reference bReduced-ﬂuence V-PDT+ranibizumab 0.5 mg 12 In 95 % of the eyes, best-corrected visual acuity remained stable or improved [74] a Reduced ﬂuence: 25 J/cm2 for 83 s b Reduced ﬂuence: 25 J/cm2 for 70 s; Standard ﬂuence: 50 J/cm2 , 600 mW/cm2 at 689 nm VA visual acuity; V-PDT Visudyne\u0002 -photodynamic therapy 224 P. Nowak-Sliwinska et al. that show PCV being refractory to anti-VEGF therapy suggest that the develop- ment of PCV is less likely to be strongly dependent on VEGF-related pathways. Bevacizumab was found to decrease the amount of exudation associated with PCV, however, the results of this anti-VEGF monotherapy were not anywhere near as promising as those obtained in the treatment of AMD [33, 65, 67, 68], possibly due to the fact that in PCV one may deal with more mature vasculature than in the case of AMD. Kokame et al., in a trial of monthly intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg) injections for PCV, reported the stabilization of vision at 6 months in 12 eyes [69], as well as resolution of subretinal hemorrhage and a decrease in macular edema. Moreover, polypoidal lesions decreased in 33 % of eyes, but branching choroidal vessels were still present. Presently, in order to investigate the safety and efﬁcacy of a high dose rani- bizumab (2.0 mg) in PCV patients, a phase II clinical trial (PEARL2) is recruiting patients [70]. The results are pending and are expected in 2013. Due to the limited effectiveness of the anti-VEGF treatment by itself in PCV, combined therapy might be an option when persistent or recurrent exudative change is seen post-anti-VEGF treatments. 10.5.1 PDT and Anti-VEGF Targeting In PDT of PCV, the mechanism of ‘‘selective’’ photothrombosis causes regression of the polyps and allows the gradual improvement of the pathological features. Combining PDT with an anti-VEGF agent can potentially create a synergistic effect that would (1) induce polyp regression, (2) reduce ﬂuid leakage, and (3) reduce inﬂammation (see Fig. 10.3 a-h). There are several studies reporting promising results on PDT combined with anti-VEGF treatment. Selected trials are summarized below, as well as in the Table 10.3. The EVEREST trial showed a 6-month efﬁcacy of V-PDT in combination with ranibizumab for PCV. Complete regression of polypoidal lesions was achieved at 6 months in 77.8 % of the eyes after combination therapy, as compared to 71.4 % after PDT alone and 28.6 % after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. At this time point the VA outcome of the 3 arms of this study was +10.9, +7.5, and +9.2 letters, respectively. However, at 24 month follow-up, 64 % of eyes treated successfully with V-PDT showed recurrence of polypoidal lesions [71]. In the study reported by Ruamviboonsuk et al. [72], 12 eyes diagnosed with PCV were treated with PDT combined with 3 monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. The patients were monitored monthly with measurements of best- corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and OCT for 1 year. At that time point, the mean BCVA change from baseline was +12.3 letters and in all patients regression of polyps without recurrence was observed. This combination therapy, however, did not reduce the number of patients who required retreatment over 1 year follow-up, when compared to data in the studies of PDT alone (see Fig. 10.3 i). 10 Photodynamic Therapy for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy 225 Also Gomi et al. reported superior results in PCV patients treated with PDT combined with intravitreal bevacizumab injection (1.25 mg) over patients treated with PDT alone. The rate of development of subretinal hemorrhage within 1 month from the initial treatment was signiﬁcantly lower in the combined therapy group than in the PDT monotherapy group. Combined treatment decreased the rate of PDT-related hemorrhage but did not affect the recurrence of the lesions [64]. In a retrospectively reviewed study of 28 patients treated with 3 monthly intra- vitreal injections of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) and V-PDT performed 1 or 2 days after the initial injection of ranibizumab [66] and a follow up of 12 months, the mean visual acuity levels improved from 0.33 at baseline to 0.61. The mean improvement in BCVA from baseline was 2.65 lines and the central retinal thickness decreased by Fig. 10.3 PDT+ranibizumab treatment results in PCV.

[72]) 226 P. Nowak-Sliwinska et al. two-fold. Combined intravitreal ranibizumab and V-PDT maintained or improved visual acuity and reduced the exudation without adverse events. Reduced-ﬂuence V-PDT (with a light dose of 25 J/cm2 delivered over 83 s, and with an irradiance of 300 mW/cm2) combined with intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) was reported recently by Sagong et al. [73] in 16 patients with PCV. At 12 months, the visual acuity improved in 56 % of the eyes by 3 lines or more, was stable in 37 % of eyes, and decreased in 1 eye because of the recurrence of polyps. Reduced-ﬂuence PDT combined with bevacizumab for PCV seemed to be effec- tive in improving vision and reducing complications. Similar promising results were reported recently using reduced-ﬂuence V-PDT (light delivery over 70 s) followed 48 h later by intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg) [74]. Summarizing, the combination therapy showed encouraging results including improved vision, the reduced incidence of subretinal hemorrhage, as well as the reduced recurrence of polyps when compared to PDT monotherapy for PCV. 10.5.2 PDT and Anti-inﬂammatory Strategies PDT destroys existing neovessels effectively acting as a ‘‘CNV eraser’’, and can be combined with an anti-VEGF strategy aimed at inhibiting further neovessel growth and leakage, and corticosteroids, which will have an anti-inﬂammatory and anti- ﬁbrosis effect. Thus, by affecting separate pathways, one may presume synergies that might lead to a better treatment outcome. Whereas, promising results of PDT in combination with anti-inﬂammatory compounds were reported in AMD, e.g., [75], this treatment modality did not seem to be so efﬁcient in PCV patients. A retrospective analysis of PCV patients who underwent V-PDT with or without intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA), with follow-up of 2 or more years, was reported [76].Totally, 27 eyes were analyzed, with 12 eyes treated by PDT monotherapy and 15 eyes treated by combined PDT with IVTA. PDT reduced the risks of visual loss in patients with symptomatic PCV in the short term, but the effect was not sustained after 1 year. The adjunctive use of IVTA during PDT did not appear to result in additional beneﬁt for treating PCV. 10.5.3 Triple Therapy To date, we have found only one report with a long-term evaluation of the com- bination therapy involving V-PDT, anti-VEGF, and anti-inﬂammatory agents [77] in PCV. The gain of visual acuity was reported in almost 42 % of patients treated with the triple therapy, and only in 12 % in the V-PDT group. Moreover, in the triple therapy group, the retreatment-free period was longer and the vitreous 10 Photodynamic Therapy for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy 227 hemorrhage was reduced as compared to that in the V-PDT monotherapy group. Further long-term studies are necessary to optimize this very promising triple therapy protocol in PCV. 10.6 Conclusions and Future Directions The current opinion for PCV treatment is based on clinical experience and a number of intermediate size and fairly large case series. A question that still remains is whether the more selective targeting of choroidal neovascular mem- branes would improve the therapeutic outcome of PDT leading to reduced re- treatment rates [78]. The current use of PDT, both in AMD and PCV, is driven mainly by its combination with other treatment strategies affecting distinctly separate pathways. Additional problem when making treatment decisions in PCV management is the branching vascular network that supplies the polyps. The branching vascular network can continue to persist or even proliferate after ther- mal laser treatment or photodynamic ablation of the polyps, and thus may ﬁnally cause new leakage. Maybe when the polyps are located outside of the macula they might be efﬁciently destroyed by a thermal laser beam. Another way to effectively and selectively close neovascularization is through treatment with vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) targeting tubulin. Tubulin is a protein dimer composed of a and b subunits that form microtubules, which are essential to cellular functions like mitosis, transport, and cytokinesis [79]. VDAs reversibly depolymerize the microtubules, leading to an instant shutdown of the blood vessels. Zybrestat (Fosbretabulin, Oxigene Inc.) is a small molecule com- bretastatin A4 phosphate prodrug that is converted to combretastatin inside endothelial cells. Once activated within the endothelial cells, it causes rapid col- lapse and necrosis of the vasculature. The compound is currently under develop- ment for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer [80]. The FAVOR trial was a phase II study investigating the use of a single intra- venous injection of Zybrestat at different doses (15–45 mg/m2) compared to pla- cebo in Asian patients with PCV, followed by imaging of the retina on days 2, 8, 15, and 28. The primary objective of the study was to observe a change in the number of polyps from baseline following the administration of Zybrestat. The data showed that Zybrestat was well tolerated. However, in the patients with decreased polyp activity, the reduction in subretinal ﬂuid and retinal edema was insigniﬁcant [81]. In conclusion, PDT combined with anti-VEGF therapy and steroid represents, at this point of time, it seems, the best treatment modality for PCV. Larger clinical trials may help to further improve this treatment of PCV. Moreover, future molecular investigations will help to identify the genetic differences between PCV and AMD. This knowledge may then lead to the design of optimal personalized treatment strategies. 228 P. Nowak-Sliwinska et al. Acknowledgments The authors are grateful for ﬁnancial support from Dr. J.

A brief overview of anti- microbial photodynamic therapy (PDT) and targeting strategies is provided for context only, followed by the development of the functional targeting that is the substance of this chapter. Deeper reviews on PDT and antimicrobial PDT are topics of other chapters in this book, and other publications. The constructs termed b-lactamase enzyme-activated photosensitizer (b-LEAP)/b-lactamase enzyme- activated ﬂuorophore (b-LEAF) and their potential applications and signiﬁcance are described in the context of existing technologies. The conclusions with the current state of the art is that this methodology may provide a practical and rapid test for establishing the utility of antibiotics to speciﬁc infections, thus reducing the empirical use of these drugs and lowering the incidence of development of drug-resistant pathogens. A less developed aspect of the chapter is the potential for the use of these same constructs in PDT, where they can be used to eradicate lactamase-based drug-resistant bacteria that survive conventional antibiotic treat- ments, in addition to drug-sensitive bacteria. The chapter ends with a perspective on the broader potential of this platform in microbiology and parasitology. S. Khan \u0002 T.

The discovery of antibiotics was a major advance of the 20th century that revolutionized the management of infectious diseases and had a high impact on overall mortality rates worldwide. However, the overuse of antibiotics empir- ically has led to widespread incidence of drug resistance, where bacteria have devised various means to render antibiotics ineffective or evade their actions. The major mechanisms implicated in antibiotic resistance include enzymatic inacti- vation of antibiotics, altered target sites, decreased uptake and increased efﬂux of the antimicrobial agents [1]. Bacteria often employ multiple resistance factors concomitantly [2, 3]. Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) form a major portion of the antibiotic- resistant infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) esti- mates *1.7 million HAI from bacteria, contributing to 99,000 deaths each year [4]. Staphylococcus aureus, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is one of the leading causes of HAI. As per the Association for Pro- fessionals in Infection Control & Epidemiology, 1.2 million HAI are caused by Staphylococcus annually in the U.S. (2007). MRSA is the most common cause of ER skin infections (New England Journal of Medicine, 2006) and caused 89,785 infections and 15,249 deaths as per reports in 2008 (CDC, 2008). On an average, hospital costs increase *$6,400 and hospital stay increases *ﬁve days due to these infections (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Brief, 2007). One of the treatment strategies has been to develop new antibiotics that can kill bacteria through different mechanisms. To this end, there have been ﬁve new classes of antibiotics since 1970—linezolid (2000) and daptomycin (2003) for systemic infections, mupirocin (1985) and retapamulin (2007) for topical infec- tions, and the recent approval of ﬁdaxomicin (2012) for the treatment of gut infections caused by Clostridium difﬁcile [5]. The rate of introduction of new antibiotics, however, does not match up to increasing drug resistance. Developing new treatment as well as diagnostic modalities, that can provide alternate treatment options and/or rapid information to guide therapy is vital. New methodologies being developed include an application of nanotechnology to deliver high payloads of antibiotics to bacteria using nanoparticles [6]; strategies to interfere with bacterial cell-to-cell communication through quorum sensing pathway to inhibit virulence and/or bioﬁlm formation [7–9]; infection control using endolysins or virion-associated peptidoglycan hydrolases produced by bac- teriophages, capable of digesting bacterial cell walls [10–12] and use of plant derived products and metal ions in conjunction with antibiotics [13]. 238 S. Khan and T. Hasan 11.2 Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy Among emerging new approaches for management of bacterial infections is PDT, a photochemistry-based approach that has demonstrated efﬁcacy against both drug-resistant and nonresistant pathogens. During PDT, light activation of certain photosensitizers (PS) results in formation of active molecular species, which are toxic to the surrounding cells and tissues [14]. Although PDT was discovered more than a century back as an antimicrobial [15, 16], its more recent application has been primarily for cancer treatment [17–19]. Renewed interest and developments in antimicrobial PDT or photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) are fairly recent, accelerated by the advent of antibiotic resistance. One of the advantages of PACT is that both antibiotic resistant and susceptible bacteria can be killed effectively [20–22]. Furthermore, so far there is no evidence of microbial resistance to PACT, even upon repeated application [23, 24]. This may be mainly because the mechanism of PDT-based killing/inhibition of microbial cells is different and relatively nonspeciﬁc compared to antibiotics, which tend to target speciﬁc components of the bacterial cell [25]. Additionally, PDT has broad spectrum of action, and the same PS can be used against bacteria, fungi and parasites. PDT has shown promise in the pathogen control preclinically and clinically [14, 26]. This mode has been utilized to treat various tropical pathogen infections including leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis and malaria, fungal infections and viru- ses, besides bacteria [27–41]. Different bacterial species, including Mycobacterium bovis BCG, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Helicobacter pylori have been demonstrated to be susceptible to PDT [14, 42–50]. Furthermore, Phase II clinical trials have revealed encouraging results for PDT of leg ulcers and diabetic foot lesions [51]. Perhaps the most successful application of PDT thus far has been in dentistry. Pathogens in plaque have shown to be efﬁciently killed, and this modality also offers viable treatment options for periodontitis, as well as sterilization of endodontic root canals [26, 52–54]. Periowave, a photodisinfection technique developed by Ondine Biomedical (Vancouver, Canada) has been tested in ﬁve clinical trials and is available in Canada and some European countries, and is under review by the FDA currently (http://www.ondinebio.com/products/ periowave). Helbo Photodynamic systems (Weis, Austria) and Denfotex Ltd (Inverkeithing, UK) have also developed PDT-based products for dentistry that have undergone clinical trials [53]. Ondine has developed other products as well for photodisinfection. These include MRSAid for eradication of bacteria in nasal passages, Exeloume for treating bacterial bioﬁlms on inner surface of endotracheal tubes and Vitalwave to decolonize the birth canal to prevent transmission of HIV and other pathogens (www.ondinebio.com). MRSAid is in clinical trials and approved as a medical device in Canada, while Exelume and Vitalwave are in the prototype stage. 11 Functional Targeting of Bacteria 239 11.3 Targeted PDT The active molecular species generated during PDT have multiple cellular targets [55]. This is advantageous because of the potential for broad use in bacteria with varied biology. However, on the ﬂip side, other than the site of PS administration, passive preferential accumulation of the PS and light illumination interval, there is no mechanism for achieving selective destruction of bacteria [56]. This can result in damage to the healthy host tissue due to the nonspeciﬁc accumulation or con- centration of PS [57]. Currently, most applications of PDT are limited to localized infections, where damage is controlled both by the slight preferential accumulation of the PS at infection site and by conﬁning the volume of illumination. To make antimicrobial PDT more widely applicable, including both regional and systemic infections, targeted approaches that minimize collateral host damage need to be devised. The simplest approaches to such targeted PDT include localized light delivery/illumination and/or targeted PSs [14, 47, 58, 59]. To date, there have been only a few approaches for targeting antimicrobial PDT. Targeted photolysis is a method by which selectivity can be achieved. A moiety recognizing a cell surface marker, such as an antibody, hormone or cytokine can be used to target PS to cells to be killed. Monoclonal antibodies conjugated to PSs have been developed for speciﬁc and focused delivery for bacterial killing [60, 61]. Using liposomes for selective delivery of PS to bacterial cells is also possible, as the presence of negatively charged molecules like pep- tidoglycans, lipotechoic acid and lipopolysachcharides on the surface results in more negative charge in bacterial cells compared to host tissues [62, 63]. One study has demonstrated use of nanoparticles to achieve PS concentration in Enterococcus faecalis in a simulated dental infection [64]. Functionalization of polymeric nanoparticles is another method which may make it possible to target speciﬁc bacteria [65, 66]. 11.4 Functional Targeting of Bacteria A targeted approach that exploits functionality unique to bacteria, and absent in mammalian cells has been developed. This allows for exquisite selectivity between bacterial and host cells. The methodology, termed b-LEAP (b-lactamase enzyme- activated photosensitizer), is centered on a novel probe construct of the same name (b-LEAP), which capitalizes on the photophysical phenomenon of quenching and dequenching of certain PS. The PS can be quenched when in close proximity, decreasing probability of PS excited state transition, and hence there is decreased formation of active molecular species or ﬂuorescence. b-LEAP is designed such that in the intact probe the PSs remain quenched. Upon cleavage of the b-LEAP probe by b-lactamase, free PSs capable of light-activated antimicrobial effects are released (Fig. 11.1). Here the chromophore serves as a PS, while in a parallel 240 S. Khan and T. Hasan approach, b-LEAF (b-lactamase enzyme-activated ﬂuorophore), the chromophore is a ﬂuorescing molecule that is used for diagnostic purposes. This is described subsequently. The underlying concept involves synthesis of a photoactivable construct, which recognizes a unique target in bacteria. We focused on b-lactamase enzyme as a molecular target to use against bacteria. The bacterial enzyme b-lactamase that targets and cleaves the lactam ring of b-lactam antibiotics is a major resistance mechanism against b-lactam antibiotics. Production of b-lactamases is believed to be the ﬁrst resistance mechanism developed against b-lactam antibiotics [67]. There is a wide array of b-lactamases with varying speciﬁcities and activities, found in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species [68–70]. b-lactamase is an attractive target to use against bacteria, as this enzyme is absent in mammalian cells. This design and concept is extendable to other targets and pathogens. 11.5 b-LEAP and Targeted Antimicrobial PDT The PS 5-(4’-carboxybutylamino)-9-diethylaminobenzo[a]phenothiazinium chlro- die (EtNBS-COOH) was shown to be a potent antimicrobial agent [71]. In b-LEAP, two EtNBS PSs are conjugated to a b-lactam ring containing cephalosporin derivative, 7-amino-3-chloromethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid p-methoxybenzyl ester (ACLE), via their free carboxy groups. b-LEAP shows ground-state quenching, and has nearly 5-fold lower ﬂuorescence emission compared to EtNBS- COOH [47]. Homodimerization quenching, as seen here, has the added advantage of releasing two active PSs following probe cleavage, with potential for double the phototoxicity compared to a heterodimer or monomeric system. This targeted use of PDT against resistant bacteria exploits a bacterial drug- resistance mechanism to activate the PS locally and speciﬁcally, affording greater selectivity [47]. b-LEAP was shown to be readily cleaved by Bacillus cereus pen- icillinase (a type of b-lactamase enzyme) with an enzyme concentration-dependent increase in ﬂuorescence emission as a function of time (Fig. 11.2,[47, 72]). Fig. 11.1 b-LEAP quenching and dequenching. The photosensitizers (R) are statically quenched (blue) in the uncleaved construct, and hence inactive. When the b-lactam nucleus (red ring)is cleaved by b-lactamase, two free photosensitizer moieties that are potentially phototoxic (red) are released 11 Functional Targeting of Bacteria 241 Thus, with higher b-lactamase enzyme concentrations, more PS will be produced correspondingly. The antimicrobial effect of b-LEAP dependent PDT was demon- strated using MRSA clinical isolates [47]. The phototoxicity of b-LEAP and free EtNBS-COOH to human foreskin ﬁbroblasts was compared, showing markedly lower toxic effects when the b-LEAP construct was used [47]. Co-cultures of MRSA and human foreskin ﬁbroblasts showed more b-LEAP uptake in the resistant bacteria compared to human cells. Thus, b-LEAP can target lactamase producing bacteria selectively, with less damage to host tissue compared to a free PS. This strategy and concept, where the bacteria’s resistance mechanism is turned against it and utilized for therapy, represents a paradigm where PDT may be applied systemically, to target infections selectively and speciﬁcally. This thera- peutic application looks promising based on this early work, and can be used in conjunction with standard antibiotic therapy and/or alone, to target both nonre- sistant and resistant bacteria. A potential limitation to this technique is that the timing of light delivery could be crucial. Enough time should have elapsed, allowing maximal release of free PS release due to b-lactamase action. At the same time, delays could result in diffusion of the cleaved product, reducing effectiveness of PDT at target infection site, as well increasing probability of nonselective host tissue damage. A better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and optimization of the time-point at which light should be applied following PS administration, as well as the duration of light application, can help circumvent these problems. An application of this functional targeting of bacteria approach, where it may have an even greater impact, is as a rapid diagnostic tool, b-LEAF. In this context, the probe has a dual application—detection of the resistance biomarker b-lacta- mase and prediction of antibiotic susceptibility. These applications are described in detail below. Fig. 11.2 Penicillinase cleaves b-LEAP resulting in ﬂuorescence increase over time 242 S. Khan and T. Hasan 11.6 b-LEAF: Rapid Diagnostic Tool for b-Lactamase Detection and Antibiotic Susceptibility Determination Currently, antibiotics are routinely prescribed before antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is available. The empiric antibiotic regimens can be associated with treatment failures and may also promote resistant strains. Essentially, a misuse of antibiotics can create a selection pressure, enabling drug-resistant populations to increase in number. Furthermore, standard procedures test low bacterial inoculums and are not time efﬁcient. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections thus dictates the need for rapid detection of bacteria and determining respective antibiotic susceptibility proﬁles, including resistance mechanisms, if any. For severe infections, especially, rapid identiﬁcation and AST are crucial factors that affect the treatment outcome [73, 74]. Strategies to simplify the pre- scription procedure based on recommendations from a rapid assessment tool are much needed [75]. b-LEAF is sensitive to b-lactamase, and can hence be used to detect this resistance biomarker. As described, b-LEAF mimics the structure of b-lactam antibiotics, and contains a cephalosporin core, including the cleavable lactam ring, conjugated to two identical EtNBS moieties [47]. By virtue of this structural similarity with b-lactam antibiotics, it can also be utilized to ascertain antibiotic susceptibility. The function of the chromophore as a ﬂuorophore, rather than as a PS, is utilized for diagnostics and a rapid (*1 h) assay for detection of b-lactamases and determination of antibiotic susceptibility simultaneously has been developed. Timely information of this nature can aid clinicians in making an educated prescription choice about treatment options, rather than relying on empiric or ‘best-guess’ regimens. Studies have demonstrated the b-LEAF substrate to be useful for rapid func- tional deﬁnition of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLS) [72]. b-LEAF can serve as a ﬂuorescent probe for the detection of b-lactamase activity and also identify the effectiveness of antibiotics by a competitive inhibition kinetic analysis (Fig. 11.3). When two substrates compete for the active site of an enzyme, their relative binding afﬁnities can be ascertained. Increasing the concentration of the competitive inhibitor increases the observed Km, as the competitor occupies the enzyme active site with respectively greater frequency. The concentration dependent increase in the observed Km can be used to determine the Ki for the competitor substrate [76]. This concept was applied to test different b-lactam antibiotics with penicillinase enzyme (a b-lactamase enzyme). b-LEAF was considered as the substrate and the b-lactam antibiotic as its competitive inhibitor. By calculating the kinetics of the reaction for b-LEAF (Vmax and Km) in the absence and presence of a competitor antibiotic, the afﬁnity of the respective antibiotic for the b-lactamase was calculated (Fig. 11.3).The reaction velocity of b-LEAF cleavage was observed as the rate of ﬂuorescent product formation (V). The dependence of V on b-LEAF concentration ([S]) was determined using multiple [S]’s and used to determine the Michaelis–Menten constant (Km). The ability of a competitor b-lactam antibiotic to increase the observed Km (Km, obs) 11 Functional Targeting of Bacteria 243 of b-LEAF was probed for a range of concentrations and used to determine the dissociation constant of the enzyme competitor complex (Ki). Further, the Ki of the b-lactam antibiotic competitor was divided by the Km of b-LEAF to derive the competitive index (Ci) (Fig. 11.3). The susceptibility of B. cereus 5/b to a panel of b-lactam antibiotics was tab- ulated, and Ci value established within 20 min (Fig. 11.4a). The competitive indices, thus determined, were shown to be related to minimum inhibitory con- centrations (MIC) determined by conventional AST methods [72], for the different antibiotics respectively, thus validating the approach (Figs. 11.4a, c). (MIC = lowest concentration of antibiotic that inhibits the bacterial growth). These ﬁndings demonstrate that the b-LEAF assay is not only more rapid than the MIC assay, but also has a greater sensitive range. Furthermore, a panel of known extended spec- trum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli strains from ATCC was assayed with b-LEAF and the antibiotic ceftazidime. These results also showed a good co- relation between the calculated Ci and conventional MICs (Figs. 11.4b, d). The incubation time for the b-LEAF assay was 20 min while that of the MIC assay was 20 h. Thus, competitive assays with b-LEAF can provide a rapid insight into antibiotic susceptibility. Though several rapid test methods are available for predicting a resistance biomarker or antibiotic susceptibility, the b-LEAF assay is the only one to date that can provide information about both aspects in a single test. We propose that the b-LEAF assay is a reliable and rapid dual predictor of b-lactamase and anti- biotic susceptibility, being at least 20-fold faster than conventional methods. An important aspect is that these studies serve as a platform technology and pave the way for the development of assays utilizing a broader variety of bacteria, targets and antibiotics.

Photochemistry and Photobiology. The American Society of Photobiology 244 S. Khan and T. Hasan The full signiﬁcance of being able to test both these parameters—resistance biomarker b-lactamase and antibiotic susceptibility, in 1 h, can be appreciated better upon understanding the state of AST currently. We discuss below some salient points to put these issues in perspective. 11.7 Available Methods for AST and Resistance Detection 11.7.1 Current State of AST Existing methodologies for determining antibiotic susceptibility include conven- tional broth/agar dilution and disk-diffusion methods, which involve culturing bacteria in presence of antimicrobials and observing their resultant growth pattern Fig. 11.4 Readouts of b-LEAF assay (20 min, a and c) and MIC assay (20 h, b and d). a Relative Ci values of b-lactam antibiotics for B. cereus 5/ß, b relative MIC values for B. cereus 5/ß, A Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of 0.899 was determined for these two data sets (a and b) indicating that b-LEAF can accurately proﬁle the susceptibility of B. cereus to a panel of b-lactam antibiotics, c the Ci values of ceftazidime for the panel of ESBLs, d the MIC values of ceftazidime for the panel of ESBLs were determined. The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of for these two data sets (c and d) was 0.984, indicating that b-LEAF accurately proﬁles the susceptibility of multiple ESBL producers to ceftazidime. All data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post test (* p \\ 0.05, ** p \\ 0.01, *** p \\ 0.001). Data reproduced from Sallum et al., Photochemistry and Photobiology [72]. Copyright 2010 The Authors. Photochem- istry and Photobiology. The American Society of Photobiology 11 Functional Targeting of Bacteria 245 [77–79]. Thereafter, based on results, the bacterial isolate is designated as sus- ceptible, intermediate or resistant to the antibiotic tested, by comparing with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Interpretive Charts [80–83]. These methods take at least 24 h to get the results. Automated instruments that serve to detect bacterial growth optically work on the same principles, while reducing the time, manual labor and errors compared to the conventional AST tests. These instruments can aid in both identiﬁcation and AST of bacteria. These methods are essentially growth-based and useful only in cases of rapidly growing bacteria. Besides taking a large window of time (24–72 h), these methods may fail to predict antibiotic susceptibilities accurately. Perhaps the greatest pitfall of conventional test methodologies is the use of relatively low bacterial numbers for testing (5 * 105 CFU/ml). In this context, it becomes important to consider phenomenon such as the ‘Inoculum effect’. Essentially, Inoculum effect is deﬁned as a signiﬁcant increase in Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC; deﬁned as lowest concentration of antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth) of an antibiotic, when number of organisms inoculated is increased. This effect is observed most commonly with b-lactam antibiotics with b-lactamase producing bacteria, and can be a cause for treatment failures [84–90]. Thus, standard methods of AST utilizing (5 * 105 CFU/ml) [80–83] may fail to report antibiotic susceptibility accurately in high burden or heteroresistant infections (as genetic heterogeneity may go unde- tected due to the low numbers tested). The b-LEAF method of detection allows for testing of even 1,000-fold higher concentrations, and hence may provide a more realistic idea of antibiotic susceptibilities in clinical infections. 11.7.2 Detection of b-Lactamase-Based Resistance In this era of varied antibiotic resistance mechanisms, diagnostics to detect resistance are gaining importance, and increasingly being performed in addition to simple antibiotic susceptibility determination. b-lactamase enzymes are produced by several clinically relevant bacteria. Several growth-based microbiological methods, most of which are variations of the disk-diffusion methods can be employed to determine b-lactamase activity [91], but are rarely used now. Examples include the three-dimensional disk tests and double-disk tests. Other more simple and rapid techniques have become more popular over the years. b-lactamase cleaves the b-lactam ring of b-lactams to form penicilloic acid. Three main methodologies rely upon detection of the penicilloic acid as an indi- cator of b-lactamase production. These include the acidimetric method which works on the principle of pH change due to formation of penicilloic acid, resulting in phenol red changing color from red to yellow; iodometric detection wherein iodine reacts with penicilloic acid rather than penicillin and color of starch-iodine complex disappears and chromogenic tests which utilize chromogenic cephalo- sporins such as nitroceﬁn, CENTA, PADAC and S1. In this case, following the cleavage of the b-lactam ring, the molecule undergoes a color change [92]. 246 S. Khan and T. Hasan These tests can be performed using commercially available strips or disks, and may also be performed by preparing strips, slides, or in tubes and microtiter plates ‘in-house’ [92]. These chromogenic methods of b-lactamase detection have emerged as the most popular and widely used in recent times. PCR-based methods involving detection of the b-lactamase gene (e.g. blaZ in S. aureus) can be used to determine b-lactamase production indirectly [93, 94]. Patho-Proof Mastitis PCR Kit from Finnzymes is a commercially available kit that can be used for detection of the blaZ gene, among others, in milk. Multiplex PCR- based methods are useful to identify bacterial species as well as determine a wide array of antibiotic resistance genes [95–97]. These PCR-based methods have been suggested as diagnostic tools to complement existing methodologies. However, they are capable of predicting only the presence of a gene, which may or may not lead to resistant phenotype. Assaying for gene expression, i.e., the functional resistance enzyme is of paramount importance, and likely to be of greater sig- niﬁcance than genotype alone. 11.7.3 Fluorescent b-Lactamase Substrates b-lactamase has been employed as a reporter system for gene expression studies [98–100] and b-lactamase substrates are utilized to aid these analyses. Some ﬂuorescent b-lactamase substrates, mainly to be employed for reporter gene assays, are available commercially from Invitrogen. These are ﬂuorescence reso- nance energy transfer (FRET) -based substrates, designed to become ﬂuorescent following cleavage by b-lactamase, and have potential for application in micros- copy, FACS and microtiter plate assays. One of these, CCF2/AM substrate has been shown to be useful for protein interaction studies and distinguishing between b-lactamase positive and negative E. coli cells [101]. A fairly recent study reports novel near-infrared ﬂuorogenic substrates to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis b-lactamase BlaC, thus allowing for imaging tuberculosis [102]. All of these are detection modalities only. The b-LEAF ﬂuorescent substrate has shown encouraging results as a diag- nostic modality for both AST and detection of b-lactamase-based resistance ([72], unpublished results). Thus far, it is the only methodology reported which can provide information about both parameters rapidly (*1 h). This approach needs to be validated and developed further toward being incorporated in clinical use, and we are currently extending this work in these directions. 11.8 Summary and Perspectives It is apparent that the rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains necessitates treating each infection with appropriate modality, rather than using a generalized approach. Rapid diagnostics as well as new treatment strategies are being 11 Functional Targeting of Bacteria 247 developed to cope with these challenges. PDT has shown great potential for generalized as well as targeted therapeutic application, as described here as well as in other chapters of this book. b-LEAP provides an extra level of sensitivity and an option for the killing of drug-resistant bacteria, while minimizing damage to host cells. This opens the potential of using antimicrobial PDT systemically and regionally. Much development remains, including improved constructs, a clearer understanding of the pharmacokinetics, illumination intervals and light delivery for translation of the approach as a therapeutic modality. In recent years, there has been an increase in development of diagnostics for pathogen infections. Different culture-based and PCR-based methods are available for pathogens like MRSA, for example [103–105]. The newer diagnostic methods seek to dissect resistance mechanisms, and also look at mixed pathogens to enable distinguishing them. Some methods like ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)- based pathogen ID kits from AdvanDx and Miacom Diagnostics are available, that can help identify different pathogens in a biospecimen. A diagnostic method to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections has also been developed [106]. Methods such as these, and others summarized in this chapter can be used to rapidly identify pathogens and resistance mechanisms, allowing for a more informed treatment choice. In this context, a multimodal method such as the b-LEAF approach, which can be used for rapid diagnostics to predict both resis- tance factor b-lactamase and antibiotic susceptibility, simultaneously, has shown great promise [72]. Further optimization of probes and assay conditions and more rigorous testing is, however, needed to develop and enable direct biospecimen testing for rapid determination of antibiotic susceptibility proﬁles for a given bacterial infection. Such a method can enable customized antibiotic therapy, improving treatment outcomes, lowering costs and reducing emergence of resis- tance. The b-LEAF technology, based on unique chemical probes that mimic antibiotic structure and target speciﬁc resistance enzymes, may be integrated with existing devices, funneled as a probe-array or probe kit that may be used in tandem with available automated instruments, and/or may be independently packaged with a small device as a portable system. Determination of treatment regimen very early on, as per severity of an infection and resistance of bacteria involved, along with prediction of effective antibiotics would be useful in primary healthcare settings, hospitals, as well as military settings. It should be noted, however, that much validation is needed to make this a routine procedure in order to negate the false positives and establish unequivocally the antibiotic drug resistance, susceptibility, virulence, etc. [105]. Finally, this technology should be viewed as a platform where constructs customized to different molecular targets (including targets other than lactamases) maybe developed for different pathogens. The lactamase targeted construct has shown effectiveness in killing of Brugia malayi, a parasite responsible for ﬁlariasis [107]. These and other applications merit further exploration to establish the impact of this rather simple technology. 248 S. Khan and T.

Application of this thera- peutic modality to the treatment of spontaneously developed infections in dogs resulted in a very efﬁcient healing of wounds with an extensive drop in the pop- ulation of pathogens. The treatment appeared to be applicable for both mycotic and bacterial infections and was devoid of detectable undesired side effects. No sig- niﬁcant differences in efﬁcacy was observed whether a porphyrin, chlorin, or phthalocyanine photosensitising agent was used in spite of strong differences in the light absorption spectrum among the three tetrapyrrole derivatives. 12.1 Introduction Porphyrins and their tetrapyrrole analogues, such as porphycenes, chlorins, phthalocyanines, and naphthalocyanines, are currently used as photosensitising agents in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors and other nononcological C.

The photodynamic process is promoted by the combined effect of a photosensitiser and visible light wavelengths, and acts via the formation of either free radical species (type I mechanism) or most frequently via energy transfer to ground-state dioxygen which is converted to the highly reactive [1] Dg singlet oxygen derivative (type II mechanism [2]. As a consequence, several constituents of cells and tissues, including nucleotides, proteins, unsaturated lipids, and steroids [3] are irreversibly damaged leading to cell death. In the case of porphyrins, the subcellular binding sites are generally represented by membranous districts, such as the plasma membrane, the mitochondrial and lysosomal membranes, the Golgi apparatus, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum; therefore, cell death is usually caused by the alteration of a number of compartments in a multitarget process [4]. Most recently, the PDT approach has been shown to act very efﬁciently also for the inactivation of a variety of microbial pathogens, including the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi, mycoplasmas, and parasitic proto- zoa [5–7].This technique is characterized by a high degree of speciﬁcity for the target microorganisms, provided the chemical structure of the photosensitiser is suitably engineered to induce the selective association of the photodynamic agent with structural elements which are typical of microbial cells. In particular, cationic photosensitisers have been demonstrated to rapidly and tightly bind with the array of negatively charged functional groups that are known to be at the surface of the outer wall surrounding several types of microbial cells [8]. The photochemically induced modiﬁcation of the outer wall signiﬁcantly increases its permeability allowing the penetration of the photosensitiser to inner cellular areas whose integrity is critical for cell survival. The application of PDT for the treatment of infections of microbial origins is thus ﬁnding an increasing interest in an attempt to overcome the rampant onset of multiresistance to antibiotics exhibited by bacterial and fungal pathogens [9]. 12.2 Rationale for Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy Microbial cells display a large variety of subcellular organizations, which has obvious effects in controlling the interaction of photosensitising agents with cell constituents, thereby affecting the efﬁciency of photosensitised cell death. How- ever, the available evidences point out that a general frame can be adopted to describe the pathway of photosensitiser binding and the pattern of photobiological events leading to cell death. Thus, the predominantly hydrophobic nature of photodynamic sensitisers usually determines their preferential or selective binding to the plasma membrane of microbial cells; hence, the photoprocess is completed within the photosensitiser microenvironment with no appreciable involvement of the genetic material [5, 9]. This feature is extremely important since porphyrin- photosensitised inactivation of microbial cells does not lead to the onset of mutagenic processes or the selection of PDT-resistant strains [10]. At the same time, the multitarget nature of the photodynamic action typical of porphyrin 256 C. Fabris et al. derivatives allows the efﬁcient inactivation of both antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial and fungal species with essentially identical efﬁcacy [11]. Typically, membrane-marker enzymes, such as NADH-, succinic-, and LDH- dehydrogenase, are extensively inhibited after very short light exposure times. The consequent alteration of the plasma membrane three-dimensional organization is accompanied by severe functional and morphological changes promoting the diffusion of the photosensitiser from its original binding sites into the cytoplasm, thus leading to the additional modiﬁcation of several cytoplasmic proteins, inhi- bition of cell-wall synthesis, and loss of potassium ions [12]. The photodynamic action of porphyrin-type photosensitisers causes both a bacteriostatic and a bactericidal effect. The interplay between these two effects is modulated by a combination of experimental variables, including the nature of the photosensitiser, the incubation time of microbial cells with the photosensitiser, the physical and chemical properties of the medium, the total delivered light dose, and the irradiation ﬂuence rate [9, 12]. A proper selection of the individual parameters allows one to achieve an extensive (up to 5–6 log) decrease in the population of the pathogenic agents, as well as a high selectivity of microbial cell killing under conditions in which the cells of the host tissue (e.g., ﬁbroblasts or keratinocytes) are spared [13]. The use of photodynamic processes for the treatment of microbial infections is thus gaining an increasing attention and initial clinical trials are under way in a number of European and North American and Brazilian centers [14]. The most suitable candidates for antimicrobial PDT are represented by localized lesions, which are susceptible to topical treatment: these include periodontitis, oral can- didosis, chronic ulcers, nasal decolonization, as well as speciﬁc diseases such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. The broad spectrum of action shown by photo- dynamic sensitisers, such as cationic porphyrins and their analogues, is of utmost importance in the case of infectious diseases which are originated by a hetero- geneous microbial ﬂora. On these bases, we performed a thorough investigation to deﬁne the potential and scope of PDT for the treatment of skin infections which are of spontaneous origin in dogs and are no longer responsive to the currently accepted antibiotic therapies. Staphylococcus pyoderma is the most common skin disease in dogs. Approximately 80 % of allergic dogs will have a secondary bacterial infection at the time of diagnosis of predisposing factors, such as atopic dermatitis, ﬂea allergy dermatitis, demodicosis, or hypothyroidism. Staphylococcus intermedius has tra- ditionally been identiﬁed as the primary pathogen isolated from canine superﬁcial and deep pyoderma. The results of such investigations could provide useful information about the advantages and limitations of antimicrobial PDT for human patients, as well as open novel perspectives for the extension of this modality to the veterinary ﬁeld. All the dogs treated by PDT were referred to veterinary treatment and controlled by a veterinarian before, during and for an at least 2-week follow up after the end of each PDT session. 12 Photodynamic Therapy 257 12.3 Treatment of Spontaneous Infections in Dogs by Photodynamic Therapy A total number of 21 dogs were treated by PDT after topical deposition of (a) a tetracationic Zn(II)-phthalocyanine, named RLP068, in a gel formulation, supplied by Molteni Farmaceutici (Italy), 6 dogs; (b) a chlorin derivative, m-THPC, in a liposome formulation, supplied by Biolitec (Germany), 7 dogs; (c) a tetracationic meso-substituted porphyrin, named C12, in a gel formulation, supplied by Frontier Scientiﬁc (USA), 8 dogs. A synthetic description of the pathologies affecting various dogs treated by PDT with the three photosensitising agents and the identiﬁed infective agents is given in Tables 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3. In all cases, the deposition of the phthalocyanine, chlorin, or porphyrin on the infected lesions had no effect per se on the characteristics of the pyoderma and the same conclusion was obtained by performing the irradiation of the lesions in the absence of topically administered photosensitiser. Typically, the irradiations were carried out by using full spectrum visible light (400–800 nm) delivered by means of a bundle of optical ﬁbers (total diameter of 8 mm) which was interconnected with the emission from a quartz/halogen lamp (Teclas, Lugano, Switzerland). On the other hand, the combined effect of the topically deposited photosensi- tising agent and visible light wavelengths resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the overall bacterial population, as determined by counting of the colonies after plating samples taken from the phototreated lesions. The drop in the number of surviving pathogens was parallel to the gradual healing of the lesions.

Fabris et al. the process was mainly depending on the depth of the lesion: for superﬁcial lesions one PDT treatment was sufﬁcient to induce a complete cure, while in most situ- ations the treatment had to be repeated at intervals of about 1 week (see Tables 12.1, 12.2, 12.3).

Analogously, for those dogs which were affected by multiple lesions, there was no difference in the rate and extent of wound healing for the different lesions. The three porphyrin derivatives tested by us showed no appreciable difference in the phototherapeutic efﬁcacy, in spite of the signiﬁcant differences existing between porphyrins, chlorins, and phthalocyanines in the spectral properties. It is also important to emphasize that all the three photosen- sitisers are characterized by a quantum yield of singlet oxygen generation (i.e., the most active intermediate phototoxic species produced through their electronic excitation) which is larger than 0.5 [15]. Finally, the dogs gave no sign of suffering or pain during the irradiation, which marks an important difference in comparison with PDT treatments using topically administered 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), where the exposure of the wounds to light often had to be interrupted owing to heavy sensation of pain [16]. This would indicate that the porphyrin derivatives deposited on the lesion by means of the formulations developed by us do not localize in signiﬁcant amounts at the level of the nerve endings. The behavior of the animals during and after the treatment was absolutely normal and no weight loss was observed. To adequately monitor the mode of action of the PDT treatment and the risk of possible undesired side effects, for all dogs the following analyses were performed and the following parameters were recorded: – identiﬁcation of the pathogens responsible for the pyoderma; – sensitivity of the isolated pathogens to different antibiotics (antibiogram); – complete blood count; – measurement of selected enzymic activities, potassium ions, bilirubin, total protein and albumin, cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, and creatinine; – electrophoresis of serum proteins; – colony counting after plating on a solid growth medium (BHA) of wads col- lected from the lesion before and after treatment. In all cases, no signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the above-listed parameters was observed as a consequence of the photodynamic treatment. Speciﬁc detailed examples of protocols used for the therapeutic approach with selected dogs are given in the following paragraph. 12.4 Speciﬁc Examples of Dogs Treated by Photodynamic Therapy for Mycotic and Bacterial Infections The detailed protocol used is exempliﬁed for two dogs. 260 C.

During the phototreatments, the animal showed no signs of disturbance or intolerance. The body weight of the dog was found to be unchanged after the fourth session of photodynamic therapy. The images below (Fig. 12.3) represent the lesion before and after each phototreatment. 12 Photodynamic Therapy 265 12.5 Conclusive Remarks The results reported in this chapter clearly demonstrate the high potential of PDT treatment for promoting the healing of skin lesions infected by bacterial and mycotic pathogens. Three photosensitisers having the tetrapyrrole macrocycle as the basic molecular skeleton were tested and showed no appreciable differences in the antimicrobial inactivation efﬁcacy. Therefore, this approach appears to be very promising as regards both the extrapolation of the ﬁndings to human patients and the opening of a novel therapeutic modality for curing wounds in pet animals. The approach appears to be devoid of undesired side effects and can be repeated a number of times without any detectable decrease in the efﬁciency. This obser- vation is probably related with the well-known property of photodynamic pro- cesses to avoid the selection of PDT-resistant microbial strains. Thus, photodynamic therapy for infections originated by microbial pathogens will become more and more important in the near future as antibiotic resistance is only expected to continue to increase.

Eltayeb 13.1 Introduction It is well documented that PDT has become a major approach for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, PDT was discovered early as a photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy and it has recently received considerable attention from researchers due to the fact that it has shown promise in the treatment of various tropical pathogens. In addition, PDT has been utilized successfully in recent years as a novel modality for noxious insects and parasite control, which is the subject of this chapter. The different classes of noxious insects, namely the activity of medical insects of vector borne- diseases such as Malaria, Filaria, and Dengue fever as well as agro-insects and pests which cause considerable damage to agro-economics, will be discussed in this chapter. Focus will be done on the control of Malaria, Filaria, and Schistosomiasis vectors in infested epidemic swamps, which we have achieved through the use of chlorophyll derivatives extracted from plants as a photosensitizer. With sunlight it works as a novel photolarvicide to control the larvae of different species of mosquito. This technique was registered as a PCT patent (WIPO) titled: ‘‘Field Application for Malaria Vector Control Using Sunlight Active Formulated Extract (SAFE)’’ [1]. SAFE is sprayed onto the breeding site (such as a swamp) where its active ingredients accumulate in the larval body and induce photo-oxidative stress upon exposure to sunlight, producing cytotoxic singlet oxygen that results in larval death. It is a target selective formula that has shown no effect on the other ben- eﬁcial organisms in the same breeding site. The advantages of chlorophyll M. H.

Most importantly, they are FDA approved for use as food additives. 13.1.1 Development of Photopesticides The photosensitizer used in the control of noxious insects and parasites is called a photopesticide. Their development came along through many stages and over many years. From 1928 to mid-1982, there have been approximately 30 publi- cations describing studies speciﬁcally designed to investigate the insecticidal activity of various dyes in the presence of visible light. Graham (1963) was one of the ﬁrst to draw attention to the possibility of using ‘‘photosensitizing agents’’ as insecticides [2]. In 1979, Pimprikar et al. studied ﬂuorescent light, and rose bengal at treatment levels of 1–20 ppm on mosquito larvae. He reported that Culex larvae were more susceptible than Aedes larvae and early instars were more susceptible than later instars. After treatment of the larval stage, physiological and morphological abnormalities were observed in the pupa and adult stages. These abnormalities made him suggest that there was improper chitin formation in the insect after treatment [3]. Similarly, Carpenter and Heitz showed that when mosquitoes larvae were exposed to rose bengal and visible light, signiﬁcant acute mortality was observed [4]. Furthermore, if the treated mosquitoes were illuminated with visible light and then put into darkness, a latent mortality was observed. Light treatment was nec- essary to obtain latent mortality, since the control groups that were exposed to the same dye concentrations, but in the dark, exhibited no latent mortality. When latent mortality was added to acute mortality, it was observed that the total toxicity as a result of the rose bengal was 10 times greater than that due to the dark toxicity [4]. The relative toxicities of 6 xanthene dyes to Culex and Aedes mosquito larvae were reported by Pimprikar et al. Their results showed that rose bengal was the most toxic, followed by phloxin B and erythrosin B. They also showed that the same dyes exhibited a low toxicity to the ﬁsh present in the mosquito breeding site [5]. Lately, compounds of plant origin have been isolated, identiﬁed and studied as phototoxins against a wide range of pests such as insects, fungi and weeds [6]. Until now, the main classes of photosensitizers studied are the furanocoumarins, thiophenes, acetylenes, extended quinones, hypericin, cercosporin, miscellaneous materials, and porphyrins [6]. 270 M. H. Abdel-Kader and T. A. Eltayeb 13.1.2 Porphyric Insecticides Porphyrins are a large class of deeply colored red or purple ﬂuorescent crystalline pigments. They are of natural or synthetic origin, and they all share a common a substituted aromatic macrocyclic ring that consists of four pyrrole-type residues linked together by four methine groups. So, what makes porphyrins special? Por- phyrins are the basis of certain compounds that are essential to life. When porphyrin is coupled with iron, heme is formed. Heme is intimately associated with blood and many of the redox enzymes involved in the metabolic processes. Also, chlorophyll is a reduced magnesium porphyrin that orchestrates photosynthesis; without it, life as we know it would be impossible [7]. Most cited studies have used porphyrins as photoinsecticides. One of the reasons they are promising photopesticides is that they absorb most of the wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Hence, they can undergo very efﬁcient photoexcitation through sunlight and produce a high quantum yield of reactive oxygen species [8]. In addition, they have several advantages such as low environmental impact and the absence of mutagenic action toward biological tar- gets as reported by Jori and Ben Amor [9, 10]. Photodynamic damage can be induced by treating the insect with exogenous porphyric compounds. This is considered a new approach in the design of insec- ticides, commonly known as porphyric insecticides. It is assumed that the appeal of porphyric insecticides may reside in the potential to design a large number of very biodegradable formulations that can act as selective photodynamic insecti- cides and herbicides. However, there lies the problem of the insects developing resistance to such insecticides [11]. Recently, Abdel-Kader et al. have reported the use of hematoporphyrin and chlorophyll derivatives (natural derivatives of porphyric compounds) as efﬁcient photosensitizing agents for the potential control of medical and agriculture pests and parasites [12–16]. They developed a novel method using these porphyric derivatives as sunlight-activated insecticides for outdoor control of noxious insects and parasites [1]. 13.2 Photodynamic Control of Noxious Insects 13.2.1 Photodynamic Control of Mosquitos: The Vectors of Malaria, Filaria and Dengue Fever Mosquitoes are estimated to transmit diseases to more than 700 million people annually in Africa, South America, Central America, Mexico and much of Asia, with one million of these cases resulting in death every year. In Europe, Russia, Greenland, Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and other temperate and developed countries, mosquito bites are now mostly an irri- tating nuisance [17]. Historically, before mosquito-transmitted diseases were 13 Photodynamic Control of Malaria Vector, Noxious Insects and Parasites 271 brought under control, mosquitoes caused tens of thousands of deaths in these countries and hundreds of thousands of infections [18]. Walter Reed, William C. Gorgas, and associates in the U.S. Army Medical Corps showed that mosquitoes were the method by which yellow fever and malaria were transmitted from person to person in Cuba and then around the Panama Canal in the early 1900s [19]. Since then, other diseases have been shown to be transmitted the same way. Mosquitoes are a perfect example of one of the many organisms that can host diseases. Of the known 14,000 infectious microorganisms, 600 are shared between animals and humans. Mosquitoes are known to carry many infectious diseases from several different classes of microorganisms, including viruses, and parasites. Mosquito-borne illnesses include Malaria, West Nile Virus, Elephantiasis, Dengue Fever, Yellow Fever, etc. These infections are normally rare to certain geographic areas. For instance, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is a viral, mosquito-borne illness usually regarded only as a risk in the tropics. However, cases of Dengue Fever have been reported in the U.S. along the Texas-Mexican border where it has never been seen before [17]. One of the greatest dilemmas that faces mosquito-borne diseases in epidemic countries is the use of DDT for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), which is con- sidered an essential method for disease control [20]. The use of DDT with its acute toxicity and chemical stability poses a signiﬁcant risk. It has been proven that DDT accumulates on the long run, which leads to a risk of toxicity for humans and wildlife. Consequently, it is one of the 12 chemicals that are identiﬁed as persistent organic pollutants and its production and use were strictly prohibited in 1972 by the Stockholm Convention, an international agreement on Persistent Organic Pollutants [21]. The use of DDT is already entirely banned in many industrialized countries and the United Nations Environmental Program is now negotiating its global ban [22]. Until it is well proven that the risks of DDT outweigh its beneﬁts, the WHO declared a cautious stand toward its use, stating that the continued use of DDT in Malaria control is expected until equally cost effective alternatives are developed [21]. In its report, the WHO conﬁrmed that there is an urgent need to develop alternative products and methods to both eradicate malaria and ﬁlaria, and to eliminate the use of DDT. Consequently, the WHO urged governments to provide the ﬁnancial resources and technical support to help accelerate the development of these alternatives [23]. In the present work, we introduce the successful implementation of the photo- dynamic process as a tool to control the different species of mosquito. Previously, it was reported by Awad et al. that a novel hematoporphyrin formula was effective in controlling culex pipens larvae in a semi-ﬁeld investigation [24]. A recent study by Lucantoni et al. demonstrated that C14-porphyrin exhibits a strong photosensitizing activity against Aedes aegypti [25]. Moreover, Fabris et al. reported on the potential of C12-porphyrin as a photolarvicide for the control of Anopheles gambiae and An. Arabienesis [26]. This new technique is designed for the outdoor control of Malaria, Filaria, and Dengue fever vectors using environmentally friendly photolarvicides 272 M. H. Abdel-Kader and T. A. Eltayeb (chlorophyll derivatives) to control the larvae stage of Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitoes. The plant derived chlorophyll derivatives, which proved their photosensitization efﬁciency in laboratory and semi-ﬁeld studies, were implemented in ﬁeld trials. These derivatives exhibit several advantages: they are low in cost, are natural products extracted from green plants, and are endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as food additives [27]. In addition, they are used in very low concentrations (lM), can be easily applied in the ﬁeld by being dissolved in an aquatic environment, and most importantly, they are highly effective, ensuring 85–100 % mortality of the mosquito larvae for a long period of residual effect. 13.2.1.1 Laboratory and Semi-ﬁeld Studies The effects of the chlorophyll derivatives concentration, total light dose, and irradiation time were monitored on the mosquito larvae by measuring the survival percentage at selected time intervals after the insects were fed in a speciﬁc medium and then exposed to a solar simulator and/or sunlight. The results were compared to a control group subjected to the same treatment protocol, except that the feeding medium did not contain chlorophyll derivatives. Results revealed that there are four interacting factors that affect the photo- dynamic activity of chlorophyll derivatives in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These factors are the concentration and accumulation of chloro- phyll derivatives, the light exposure dose, and the exposure time. For ﬁeld applications, other factors have to be taken into consideration, such as the weather and its effect on solar irradiance, according to both location and season, and the economic level, in relation to the cost of chlorophyll derivatives and the extent of infestation by the studied vectors. Two complementary methods were used in this study to investigate the efﬁ- ciency of chlorophyll derivatives as photolarvicides of Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens. The ﬁrst method examined the effect of external factors (chloro- phyll derivative concentration, light dose, and exposure time) and the results were shown as percent survival of the larvae as a function of the magnitude of the external factor. The second method investigated the internal factors, which rep- resent the accumulation inside the organs and tissues of the larvae. Figure 13.1 shows the effect of different concentrations of chlorophyll deriva- tives (from 10 to 70 lM) on the survival percentage of the Culex pipiens larvae after 30 min of exposure to sunlight (for each concentration a group of 100 larvae per replicate was used). Not more than 15 % survival was observed during this exposure time when a concentration of 70 lM was used. On the other hand, the other concentrations caused less than 20 % survival 30 h after irradiation. The control group, which was fed in a chlorophyll-free feeding medium, showed 95–100 % survival even after three days. The second experiment focused on light dose, which plays an important role in controlling the process of chlorophyll derivative photosensitization. Figure 13.2 13 Photodynamic Control of Malaria Vector, Noxious Insects and Parasites 273 illustrates the effect of different irradiances from the solar simulator on the survival of Culex pipiens larvae in the presence of a 50 lM chlorophyll derivatives con- centration. ORIEL CORPORATION Solar Simulator (USA) was used as source of incoherent artiﬁcial light, simulating sunlight. The difference in survival between the highest and lowest irradiance was less than 20 % after 48 h. It is worth mentioning that Anopheles and Culex larvae integuments, which are partially transparent to light, play an important role by enabling higher sensitivity to lower light doses as shown in the obtained results. In addition, exposure time can compensate for the lower chlorophyll derivative concentrations. Therefore, during ﬁeld implementation, it is possible on long sunny days to use chlorophyll derivative concentrations lower than those used on cloudy days. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) results provide the best infor- mation source for investigating the chlorophyll derivative distribution inside the body organs of Anopheles gambiae and Culex pipiens larvae. It also supplies three information rich functions: ﬂuorescence images, ﬂuorescence spectra and lifetime measurements. Fluorescence images provide a qualitative view of chlorophyll derivative dis- tribution inside the larvae bodies, monitoring its dynamics as a function of time. 0 10 20 30 0 50 100 *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ****** *** Time elapsed after irradiation (hrs)Survival(% of control)10 µM 30 µM 50 µM 70 µM Fig. 13.1 Effect of different concentrations of the chlorophyll derivative on the survival percentage of the Culex pipiens larvae 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 50 100 *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ********* *** ****** Time elapsed after irradiation (hrs)Survival(% of control) 250 W/m 2 450 W/m 2 650 W/m 2 Fig. 13.2 Effect of different light irradiances on the percentage of survival of Culex pipiens larvae at different elapsed time 274 M. H. Abdel-Kader and T. A. Eltayeb Figure 13.3a, b illustrate the difference between a mosquito larva without and with chlorophyll derivatives inside it, respectively. The ﬂuorescence images investigate the extent of the effect of the photo-oxidation process that damages the organs and tissues of the mosquito larvae, as can be seen in Fig. 13.3c, d by comparing the mosquito larva transverse section (T.S) before and after treatment. Fluorescence spectra measurements inside the tissues of Anopheles larvae provide a quantitative method for estimating the accumulated chlorophyll deriv- atives at any incubation time and after light exposure. These are very essential measurements for ﬁeld applications to optimize the parameters of the photo- chemical processes for the target species and to save nontarget species that are living in the same infected swamp (target selectivity) (Fig 13.4). Fluorescence lifetime measurements at deﬁnite spots inside the tissues of Culex pipiens and Anopheles gambiae larvae provided a good estimation of the distri- bution ratio of aggregated and nonaggregated forms of the photosensitizer. Lifetime measurements of spots inside the Culex larvae were determined to be 1.5 ± 1.04 ns for the 5 h incubation period and 11.9 ± 3.3 ns for the 15 h incubation period. The data was obtained by monoexponential ﬁtting. The differences may be attributed to the different ratios of aggregated and nonaggregated forms of chlorophyll deriva- tives, which affect the efﬁcacy of the photosensitization process [15]. Fig. 13.3 Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of Culex pipiens larva incubated with porphyrin derivatives before light exposure (a, c) and after light exposure (b, d) 13 Photodynamic Control of Malaria Vector, Noxious Insects and Parasites 275 13.2.1.2 Field Application Field investigations were carried out based on laboratory and semi-ﬁeld results. In these trials, chlorophyll derivatives were added to the infested swamps to be taken up by the mosquito larvae. The accumulated photoactive compound inside the larvae body induces, upon sunlight exposure, an oxidation stress that results in the organism’s death. As an example, in Kasangati and Namanve cities of Wakiso, a district in Uganda, chlorophyll derivatives (as sunlight active photosensitizers) were applied to cover 250,000 square meter of infected swamps and sand pits (4 gm/m2). The infected cities were mapped for this ﬁeld study using Geographical Positioning System (GPS). All the biotic and abiotic factors were measured before and after treatment. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) measurements were used to monitor the concentration and the dynamic distribution of chlorophyll deriva- tives inside the larvae of Anopheles gambiae mosquito. The results were collected 2 h after onset of exposure to sunlight. They revealed that 85–100 % mortality of larvae population was obtained at different concen- trations of chlorophyll derivatives (ranging from 0.1 to 100 lM). Other biological beneﬁciary organisms, such as the dragonﬂy larvae and mosquito predator larvae, which were present in the same treated swamps, were not affected (target selec- tivity).

Figure 13.5 shows the effect of chlo- rophyll derivatives on the mosquito larvae (Anopheles arabiensis) exposed to sunlight in the mosquito infected swamp area. The resistance of insects to chlorophyll derivatives during treatment of different generations needs further assessment. The results of this work and the concepts of insect resistance may provide primary observation for the ability of the insects to counteract the effect of chlorophyll derivatives. These ﬁeld trials are the result of three years of continuous and persistent work, which have allowed the identiﬁcation of different forms of mosquito infected swamps as well as their access roads through the villages. The results of the ﬁeld trials have shown promising success in eliminating vectors over a short period of time by cutting the mosquito’s lifecycle without formation of new generation or reinfestation. Cooperation with the local inhabitants, among whom awareness to this project was raised by instructing them on the ofﬁcial ﬁeldwork procedures, will pave the road to future large-scale countrywide projects. 13.2.2 Photodynamic Control of Houseﬂy (Musca domestica) It has been proved that houseﬂies carry, both externally and internally, certain disease producing germs. For example, several observers have shown that bacilli pass through the alimentary canals of ﬂies. The bacilli of cholera were found in great numbers on the bodies of ﬂies within 17 h after the insects had been fed on cholera-infected material. It was found that the bacilli persisted in the specks for several days and there were enough colonies to transmit disease [28]. Around 1920, the common methods of houseﬂy control were screening, ﬂy traps, fans, sprays and ﬂy-poisons. There are some natural enemies capable of killing the house ﬂy at its different stages such as Bacterium delendae, Rickestiae, viruses, spirochetes, fungi and mites [29].

Many of these chemical poisons have been tested and applied on houseﬂies such as the chitin synthesis inhibitor, triﬂumuron, propetamphos, pyrethroid, azamethi- phos, chlorpyrifos plus permethrin and malathion [30, 31]. Biocontrol has played an important role in the process of houseﬂy (Musca domestica) control through the use of different biological systems such as Spa- langia endius, Spalangia nigroaenea, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus bassiana, Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata), S. cameroni and M. raptor [32–36]. Yoho et al. [37] investigated the efﬁcacy of photodynamic action against the adult houseﬂy using primarily the halogenated series of ﬂuorescein dyes. The toxicological data was compared with the parameters of light source and its intensity, duration of light exposure, dye structure and concentration in the diet [38]. Later on, Yoho et al. studied a series of 14 food, drug and cosmetic dyes for their usefulness in being photodynamically toxic to houseﬂy adults [6]. Pimprikar et al. [5] attempted to control houseﬂies in a commercial caged layer house using weekly applications of aqueous solutions of erythrosin B directly on the manure. In a 5-week duplication treatment period, they reported a decrease of up to 90 % of adult and larva houseﬂies with respect to pretreatment levels and no changes in the beneﬁcial soldier ﬂy larval population. In the manure that was illuminated by indirect sunlight, the dye was reported to be rapidly degraded, such that only about 20 % was extractable one week after spraying. As a result of these tests, Primprikar et al. [39] studied the effects of several ﬂuorescein derivatives on each developmental stage of the houseﬂy. Treated adults exhibited lower fecundity, the eggs exhibited a reduced viability and mortality was observed in each life stage of the houseﬂy. Respicio and Heitz [40] began a study of the development of resistance to erythrosin B in the houseﬂy. A laboratory strain developed only 6-fold resistance after 40 generations of challenge by erythrosin B. Later, the cross-resistance of erythrosin B-resistant houseﬂies was studied against strains resistant to propoxur, DDT, permethrin and dichlorvos. Recently, El-Tayeb used the hematoporphyrin dihydrochloride (HP) to control Musca domestica. He reported in his study the high efﬁciency of HP in controlling houseﬂies in their breeding sites [41]. Two complementary methods have been used to investigate the efﬁciency of HP as a photopesticide against Musca domestica ﬂies. One method investigated the effect of external factors (HP concentration, light dose and exposure time) in which the results were revealed by Robinson and Beatson [42] as percent of survival of ﬂies as a function of the magnitude of the external factors. The second method, investigated the internal factors. The most important of these are the dynamic behavior and accumulation distribution of HP inside the organs and tissues of Musca domestica ﬂies. These characteristics may describe and explain the strange effects of some external factors, such as the differences in time of mortality after light exposure, and the best time of HP application before light exposure (incubation period). 278 M. H. Abdel-Kader and T. A. Eltayeb Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) supports the investigation of the behavior of HP in the organs of Musca domestica ﬂies and explains the results of the ﬁnal effects of the photosensitization process on their mortality rates. Fluo- rescence images provide a qualitative view of HP dynamics inside the ﬂies; this makes it easy to differentiate between the treated ﬂies and control ones and to differentiate among the ﬂies treated with different concentrations of HP. By comparing the images of the alimentary canals (a.c.) of control and treated ﬂies (Fig. 13.6a, b), it is easy to ﬁnd the stress caused by HP accumulation on the a.c. walls. This may have caused the diffusion of HP from inside the a.c. to the outside. This is seen in the images of other organs outside the a.c. such as the fat bodies and the muscles of treated ﬂies. This may solve the debate around the reason for the presence of photosensitizers in the tissues outside the a.c. [6]. The veins of the houseﬂy wings showed some extent of HP (Fig. 13.6d) compared to the control houseﬂy wing (Fig. 13.6c). This may give an indication of the cause of the damage of the ﬂy’s external organs such as the wings and the eyes (Fig. 13.7). The optical slices of the houseﬂy’s alimentary canal give an indication of HP distribution in the lumen of the a.c. (Fig. 13.8). Fluorescence spectra of CLSM of the houseﬂies provided quantitative estima- tion of the accumulated HP inside their organs. By comparing the results obtained by the spectrometer of CLSM, it was found that the treated ﬂy had some HP in the organs outside the alimentary canal, even those that did not appear in the ﬂuo- rescence images. This may explain the reason for the ﬂies’ mortality during light Fig. 13.6 CLSM images for houseﬂy alimentary canal and wings incubated in HP free medium (a and c) and HP medium (b and d) 13 Photodynamic Control of Malaria Vector, Noxious Insects and Parasites 279 exposure. It may be related to the presence of HP around the cells of the nervous system and the respiratory system outside the alimentary canal. The observed slow mortality of the ﬂies (which requires a long time after light exposure), may be related to the effect of the photooxidation stress of HP inside the alimentary canal which causes damage to the a.c.’s cell layer lining. Therefore, the main reason of death will be indirectly due to starvation. Since epithelial cells that are responsible for food absorption line the alimentary canal, the damaged alimentary canal stops the absorption of digested food and no longer supplies the other body organs. It is worth mentioning that the distribution ratio of monomeric and oligomeric forms of HP inside the tissues plays an important role in the efﬁciency of the photosensitization process. This information is well-demonstrated by measuring the lifetime of HP ﬂuorescence in different positions inside and outside the Fig. 13.7 Stereo microscope images for HP-treated houseﬂy whole body (a), wing (b), and eye (c) Fig. 13.8 CLSM optical slices images for houseﬂy alimentary canal in different optical depths (0–160 lm) 280 M. H. Abdel-Kader and T. A. Eltayeb alimentary canal. The lifetime of the monomeric HP & oligomeric sites was 11 ± 2.3 and 4 ± 1.1 respectively. The results obtained reveal that HP is an efﬁcient photopesticide for the control of houseﬂies. This instigates us to start to pursue ﬁeld studies to control Musca domestica in their open breeding sites. 13.2.3 Photodynamic Control of WhiteFly The whiteﬂy (Bemisia tabaci) is a hazardous pest of cotton and vegetable crops. It’s primary damage on cotton results from honeydew deposits on cotton lint, which reduces its quality and value. Some trials were done to produce plants such as soybean that resist the whiteﬂy infection [43]. The widespread use of insecti- cides has disturbed the parasite and predator populations, and enhanced whiteﬂy fertility. This has also led to an increase in the development of resistance to most of the insecticides used in conventional programs [44, 45]. That is why we are interested in investigating the effect of the photodynamic process on whiteﬂy control. In this investigation, natural and artiﬁcial light sources were used in combi- nation with two types of photosensitizers, Hematoporphyrin IX (HP) and Alu- minum Phthalocyanine (PC), for the control of whiteﬂy (Bemisia tabaci) adult, nymph and eggs stages (Fig. 13.9). HP and PC have high photosensitizing activity toward biological systems. They lack signiﬁcant toxicity in the dark and they are environmentally friendly [14]. The efﬁciency of using these photosensitizers depends on their concentration, the light irradiance, and the light exposure time. The effect of different concentrations of HP (1 9 10 -2,1 9 10-4 and 1 9 10-6 mol/l) on the whiteﬂy’s eggs exposed to sunlight irradiance (390–490 W/m2) for 1 h were investigated. Results reveal that at a concentration of 1 9 10-2 mol/l the survival percentage of the eggs is 8 % after 5 days from irradiation. At the same time, the concentration of 1 9 10-4 mol/l resulted in 55 % eggs survival percentage. The lowest concentration of 1 9 10-6 mol/l resulted in the highest survival percentage (*70 %) after 5 days from irradiation. Data showed the effect of different concentrations of PC (1 9 10-2,1 9 10-4 and 1 9 10-6 mol/l) on whiteﬂy’s eggs when exposed to the same conditions as in the case of HP. The concentration of 1 9 10-2 mol/l resulted in 16 % of the eggs’ survival after 5 days from irradiation. In comparison, the concentration of 1 9 10-4 mol/l resulted in 70 % of the eggs’ survival after the same time interval. The lowest concentration of 1 9 10-6 mol/l resulted in the highest survival per- centage (*90 %) after 5 days from irradiation [46]. The range of irradiance which was chosen in this study matches the range of sunlight irradiance between winter (average 250 W/m2), and summer (average 600 W/m2) in Egypt. In this experiment, three different irradiance (200, 400 and 600 W/m2) were applied. Data of HP and PC eggs treatment indicates the effect of different irradiance from the solar simulator light and show the signiﬁcant changes 13 Photodynamic Control of Malaria Vector, Noxious Insects and Parasites 281 (P \\ 0.05) in percentages of survival rates with the change of the irradiance. It shows that higher irradiance (600 W/m2) results in a lower percentage of survival of eggs (25 % for HP treatment and 47 % for PC treatment) while the lower irradiance, (200 W/m2), results in higher percentage of survival of eggs (88 % for HP treatment and 92 % for PC treatment) after 5 days from irradiation. It was found that the mortality percentage of eggs increases signiﬁcantly with the increase of the exposure time for both treatments of HP and PC (P \\ 0.05). It should be noted that the exposure times used were 30, 60, and 90 min, respec- tively. The exposure time of 90 min resulted in 50 and 68 % of eggs survival for eggs treated with HP and PC, respectively, after 5 days from irradiation by the sunlight. The exposure time of 60 min resulted in a survival rate of 70 and 83 % of the eggs treated with HP and PC, respectively, after the same time interval. The exposure time of 30 min led to a survival rate of 85 and 90 % of the eggs treated with HP and PC, respectively, on the 5th day after irradiation. In conclusion, results of this work revealed that a few micromoles of the dye are sufﬁcient to induce lethal effects after one-hour exposure to sunlight irradiance, which is typical of a mid-autumn day at Mediterranean latitudes. Results also indicate that the hematoporphyrin IX efﬁciency is better than aluminum phthalo- cyanine efﬁciency in the control of whiteﬂies. However, both HP and PC represent promising environmentally friendly photoinsecticidal agents [46].

Eltayeb 13.3 Photodynamic Control of Parasites 13.3.1 Photodynamic Control of Schistosomiasis Schistomiasis, also known as bilharzias, is a chronic worm infection caused by several species of blood ﬂukes of genus Schistosoma. It’s the most prevailing endemic disease in the world, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Schis- tosomiasis is estimated to affect 200 million people around the world, causing high levels of morbidity and mortality in 74 countries in tropical and subtropical areas [47]. Three main Schistosoma species infect humans: Schistosoma masoni, present mainly in Africa and South America, Schistosoma haematobium, found in Africa and the Middle East, and Schistosoma japonicum, which is endemic in Asia. Eighty percent of the transmission of this disease occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. The construction of many dams providing hydroelectric power and water for irrigation has given rise to the spread of this disease despite transmission control programs [48]. In Egypt, in 1851, Theodor Bilharz discovered, in autopsy material, that the causative agent of hematuria is Schistosoma. It was again in Egypt, around 1914, that Leiper discovered the two genera of Bulinus and Biomphilaria snails that transmitted the two species Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni, respectively [49]. During the past four decades, numerous efforts have been made to overcome schistosomiasis throughout the world. In 1985, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that reducing or limiting the transmission of the parasite by snail control strategies could be a rapid and efﬁcient method. Thus, priority was given to the extensive use of molluscicides in the ﬁeld. Five years later, as a result of advances in parasitological diagnostic techniques and chemotherapy, the WHO modiﬁed the strategy, giving priority to the control of morbidity rather than the control of transmission, and preferentially developed chemotherapy [50]. In 1993, the WHO raised the alarm with a necessary return to snail control strategies in association with chemotherapy [51]. Over the past 20 years, the treatment of Schistosomiasis has been considerably improved by the use of praziquantel, a drug that is effective generally in a single dose against all Schistosoma species. How- ever, its extensive use in endemic populations seems to be the origin of the possible development of parasite tolerance to praziquantel. Reduced efﬁciency of praziquantel treatment was recorded in Senegal and Egypt, and different ﬁeld and laboratory studies indicated the appearance of praziquantel-resistant isolates of schistosomes. Existing control methods are aimed principally at the management of snail populations that inhabit endemic areas [52]. Control of schistosomiasis is concentrated mainly on the treatment of patients against schistosomes and the elimination of the intermediate hosts mentioned previously (snail vectors). For the past 15 years, our research group has used the photodynamic process as a tool to control schistosomiasis. Focus has been done on the investigation of Hematoporphyrin IX (HP) on the different life cycle stages of 13 Photodynamic Control of Malaria Vector, Noxious Insects and Parasites 283 the schistosome, mainly the eggs, cercariae, and snails of the haematobium and mansoni species. In this work, hematoporphyrin IX (HP) concentration was considered to be the main variable when studying the photosensitization process compared to other factors (light intensity, rate of up-take and time of irradiation), and the effective limits of the other factors were measured according to the amount of HP used. This was done to get a cost effective control method for a ﬁeld application. In the prospective ﬁeld application, under sunlight exposure, the effective HP concen- tration will be related to the other uncontrollable parameters such as sunlight intensity and exposure times. The most sensitive stage to PDT treatment in the life cycle of the schistosome were the cercaria and the eggs. In this context, cercaria results demonstrate clearly the successful control of schistosomes parasites. This will be summarized by investigating the effect of HP concentration on the survival of cercaria. At a concentration of 10-2 mol dm-3, 100 % mortality of Schistosoma hae- matobium cercaria was observed after 10 min from exposure to sunlight. 10-3 mol dm-3 caused 22.4 % cercariae survival after 10 min of irradiation, while the concentration 10-4 mol dm-3 caused 35.2 % survival for the same exposure time. When the concentration of HP was decreased to 10-7 mol dm -3, the percentage of survival was 72 %. The extent of cercaria damage by PDT in whole body and surface texture caused by the photosensitization process is shown in the electron microscope images (Figs. 13.10 and 13.11). It is obvious that the photosensitization process caused head and tail to be cut from the whole body as well as causing permanent change in the surface texture such as damage to the body surface protrusions. According to the results of this experiment, lethal and sublethal HP concen- trations are enough to induce cercarial reduction. These results represent conclu- sive proof of the high potential and efﬁciency of the PDT technique in cutting the life cycle of the schistosomes and controlling their parasites [52] (Fig. 13.11). 13.3.2 Photodynamic Control of Fascioliasis Intermediate Host (Lymnaea Natalensis) Fascioliasis is an important food-and water-borne parasitic disease caused by liver ﬂukes of the genus Fasciola (e.g., Fasciola gigantica). Human fascioliasis has been reported in numerous countries. It is estimated that millions of people are infected worldwide and the number of people at risk exceeds 180 million. Also, fascioliasis is one of the most important parasitic diseases in grazing animals, with over 700 million production animals being at risk of infection. Therefore, these parasites cause signiﬁcant public health problems and substantial economic losses to the livestock industry. 284 M. H. Abdel-Kader and T. A. Eltayeb Fig. 13.11 Electron microscope images for surface texture of control (b) and treated (a) showing spike damage on the surface of S. haematobium cercaria Fig. 13.10 Electron microscope images for control (a) and treated (b–e) showing head and tail damage of S. haematobium cercaria body 13 Photodynamic Control of Malaria Vector, Noxious Insects and Parasites 285 Lymnaeid snails are the ﬁrst intermediate hosts for several Fasciola spp. The main snail host for the liver ﬂuke, Fasciola gigantica,is Lymnaea natalensis, which is widely distributed in Africa [53, 54]. In this study, an experimental investigation was performed to monitor the efﬁciency of HP to control L. natalensis snails as well as a number of environ- mental factors that affect this efﬁciency [55]. This protocol was designed to esti- mate the rate of photosensitization reactions under such environmental conditions e.g., pH, minerals, water depth, and temperature. One of the most important environmental factors is the salt content of the Nile River (Ca +2,Na+1 and Mg+2). Although the concentration of these salts are very low, they have a signiﬁcant effect on the rate of the photosensitization process [56]. The efﬁciency of the photosensitization process in the Nile river water was found to be higher than in distilled water (d.w.). This difference in efﬁciency is not related to the effect of the media on the accumulation rate, which shows no signiﬁcant difference in the two media. Therefore, the HP efﬁciency difference may be related to high density of electrons due to the presence of salts in the medium of the photosensitization process. Grosso et al. claimed that high polar media are usually preferred in the synthetic application of photoinduced electron transfer reactions because in these media most photoinduced electron transfer reactions afford free radical ions well. However, it is known that some free radical ions may react quickly with polar solvent molecules [57]. HP concentrations induced different effects on the rate of survival of Lymnaea natalensis eggs. This is signiﬁcant at HP concentrations of 10-5 and 10-4 mol dm-3 in case of saline water and distilled water, respectively. This means that the presence of Nile river salts may improve the economic value of the photo- sensitization process in the case of Lymnaea natalensis egg control. The acidity of Nile River water can be changed as a result of pollution, acidic rains, and human–water interaction. So it is important to examine the efﬁciency of the photosensitization process in case of changes in water pH (within the tolerance range of living organisms). The present results indicate that the photosensitization process is more efﬁcient in an alkaline medium than in an acidic medium. How- ever, Lymnaea eggs in the acidic medium had a signiﬁcantly higher HP accu- mulation rate than in the alkaline medium. It was reported that [58] at higher pH, the quantum yield increased due to increased OH- availability for electron donation. This interprets the signiﬁcant higher efﬁciency of the photosensitization process in the alkaline medium in this work. In this work, the effect of HP sublethal concentrations on Lymnaea natalensis eggs and hatched snails was studied. The effect of HP sublethal concentrations on egg hatching ability was investigated. In addition, the growth, survival and lon- gevity of the hatched snails was studied. The hatching ability was signiﬁcantly decreased with an increase in HP concentrations from 10-7 to 5 9 10-5 mol dm-3. The hatching percent of Lymnaea eggs that were treated with HP concentration of 5 9 10-5 mol dm-3 was 51.1 %. This concentration appeared to be the lowest limit of sublethal HP concentrations, which can affect Lymnaea eggs. 286 M. H. Abdel-Kader and T. A. Eltayeb The survival rate of snails in the control group 9 weeks after hatching was 60 %. Meanwhile, for HP concentrations of 10-7 and 5 9 10-5 mol dm-3, the survival rates were 30 and 25 %, respectively. This may result from the effect on the HP- treated embryos during their developmental stage and, this can be monitored at the adult stage of the snails. The survival of eggs treated with a lethal concentration of HP at different temperatures and pH was followed up in this work. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the fate of surviving eggs treated with lethal HP concentration. Higher temperature (30 \u0003C) and higher pH (pH 8) caused signiﬁcant decrease in the hatching percent of eggs (26.3 and 29.7 %, respectively) versus 100 % hatching of the control group (26 ± 1 \u0003C and pH 7). Figure 13.12 shows ﬂuorescence microscope images of Lymnaea natalensis eggs incubated with HP for different periods (0, 4, 6, 9, 14, and 23 h). It is obvious that there is a changeable relation (alternative increase and decrease in the amount of HP) between HP accumulation and HP release. At zero incubation time the egg samples had no HP. After 4 h they had a high amount of HP, and after 9 h they also had a high amount of HP. At the accumulation period of six hours, HP amounts were less than the 4 and 9 h accumulation periods. Still, it is easy to detect some constant amounts of HP throughout the period of HP release.

These photoactivatable insecticides, which act through photodynamic pathways, clearly appear to possess several favorable features and a broad scope of applications. The greatest challenge for our team has been in our efforts in using porphyrins against noxious insects and parasites, such as agricultural pests, and to control different diseases, like malaria, ﬁlaria, and schistosomiasis. The ﬁeld trials that we have performed in the African swamps to control malaria were very successful. They were designed for outdoor treatment using a target selective formula against mosquito larva that has no effect on the other beneﬁcial organisms in the same breeding sites. These efforts will pave the road to future large-scale countrywide projects. In conclusion, results of this work introduce a promising and innovative modality for noxious insects and parasites control. Future aims include the incorporation of nanoparticles in this photodynamic process in order to produce a photoinsecticide that combines efﬁciency, low cost, and highest levels of human safety and environmental friendliness.
