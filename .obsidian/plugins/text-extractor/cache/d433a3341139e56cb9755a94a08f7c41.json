Despite the synthesis of a vast array of MOFs exceeding 100,000 varieties, certain formulations have exhibited suboptimal performance characteristics. Therefore, there is a pressing need to enhance their efficacy by identifying MOFs with superior drug loading capacities and minimal cytotoxicity, which can be achieved through machine learning (ML). In this study, a stacking regression model was developed to predict drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs using datasets compiled from various literature sources. The model exhibited exceptional predictive capabilities, achieving R 2 values of 0.907 for drug loading capacity and 0.856 for cytotoxicity. Furthermore, various model interpretation methods including partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation, Shapley additive explanation, decision tree, random forest, CatBoost Regressor, and light gradient-boosting machine were employed for feature importance analysis. The results revealed that specific metal atoms such as Zn, Cr, Fe, Zr, and Cu significantly influenced the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs. Through model validation encompassing experimental validation and computational verification, the reliability of the model was thoroughly established. In general, it is a good practice to use ML methods for predicting drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity analysis of MOFs, guiding the development of future property prediction methods for MOFs. 1. Introduction Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs, also known as porous coordina- tion polymers) are an emerging class of porous materials constructed from metal-containing atoms (also known as secondary building units) and organic ligands (Zhou and Kitagawa, 2014). With notable advan- tages such as large surface area, high porosity, and customizable func- tionality (Guo et al., 2022), MOFs have garnered increasing interest, leading to their wide-ranging applications across various fields, including biomedicine (Hofmann-Amtenbrink et al., 2015; Horcajada et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2021), food processing (Kaur et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2020), cosmetics (Dai et al., 2012; Gaudin et al., 2012), energy storage (Pomerantseva et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021), and pollution detection (Wang et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2021), among others. Notably, MOFs have recently emerged as promising drug carriers (Abedi et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2020; Pooresmaeil and Namazi, 2022; Tajahmadi et al., 2023), where their drug loading capacity and biocompatibility play pivotal roles in biomedical applications. Consequently, research on the cytotoxicity of MOFs has also attracted significant attention. It has been shown that the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs are affected by their physicochemical properties, such as topology, composition, particle size, and zeta potential (Tamames-Tabar et al., 2014). During the recent decade, the exponential growth of experimental data on MOFs has hampered their applications and commercialization (He et al., 2021; Jeong et al., 2024). To screen MOFs with superior performance, machine learning (ML) techniques have been employed as powerful tools. For example, ML was used to predict hydrogen storage and methane uptake in MOFs (Ahmed and Siegel, 2021; Suyetin, 2021). Moreover, the time and economic costs of ML methods are several orders of magnitude lower than those of the previously conventional laboratory approaches. In addition, ML is suitable for dealing with complex * Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: liuxujie@gdut.edu.cn (X. Liu), heyan129@gdut.edu.cn (Y. He). 1 These authors contributed equally.

In the field of biomedicine and drug delivery, ML has been successfully employed for the prediction of pharmaceutical formulations (Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2019). In our previous work, we successfully used ML to predict the drug loading capacity of ibuprofen in MOFs (Liu et al., 2022). However, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on the biocompatibility of MOFs. Only a few reviews have summarized that the biocompatibility of MOFs is related not only to their physical properties, including size, shape, and zeta potential, but also to their metal atoms and organic ligands (Ahmadi et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2021). To date, ML has rarely been applied to predict the cytotoxicity of specific MOFs. In this study, we aimed to develop ML models that can predict the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs and then identify the key physicochemical properties of MOFs that significantly influence the drug loading capacity and/or cytotoxicity. To accomplish this, data on drug loading capacity (161 items) and cytotoxicity (444 items) were obtained from the literature after data screening. The dataset was con- structed by incorporating the Morgan fingerprint of the drug molecule and the physicochemical structure properties of MOFs. Stacking algo- rithms were then employed, which have been proven effective in ML classification and regression problems (Sill et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2022). Moreover, multiple model comparison and feature importance analysis methods were used to evaluate the prediction results of various models, including adaptive boosting regressor (AdaBoost), CatBoost Regressor (CatBoost), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), K-neighbors regres- sor (KNR), light gradient-boosting machine (LGBM), Hist gradient boosting (HGB), partial dependence plots (PDPs), individual conditional expectation (ICE), and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP). In addi- tion, the crucial fingerprints of drug molecules were analyzed for their impact on drug loading capacity, and the performance of stacking al- gorithms was validated by comparing the experimental outcomes with the predicted results of the model. Overall, the application of ML enables a faster and more efficient way of predicting properties and establishing component–property relationships of MOFs. This study also demon- strates the potential of ML in the field of biomaterials, contributing to the accelerated development of biomaterials within the realm of artifi- cial intelligence. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Literature survey and datasets generation All the datasets were compiled from more than 300 articles regarding the drug loading or cytotoxicity of MOFs published between 2006 and 2022. Various online resources, including Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ACS, and Wiley, were filtered using keywords such as “MOFs,” “drug loading,” “toxicity,” or “cytotoxicity” to ensure relevance. To ensure the accuracy of the results, MOFs that were modified, bimetallic, or composited were excluded to focus on pure MOFs and reduce the interference of other features. For data pre- processing, we employed one-hot encoding to normalize the data and indicate the presence or absence of features. In addition, we normalized the units of different variables. For example, the unit for drug loading capacity was normalized into g/g, the zeta potential was normalized into mV, the size was normalized into nm, the time was normalized into h, the concentration was normalized into μg/ml, and the cell viability was normalized into % of control. For items with limited missing data, polynomial interpolation was used to fill in missing data. The features of MOFs, such as central atom types, Morgan fingerprint of drug molecules, organic ligands, functional groups, and drug loading capacity of different drugs, were recorded to generate the dataset for drug loading capacity. When converting drug molecules into features, RDKit was used to generate Morgan fingerprints as features. During the conversion of each molecule into a feature, RDKit generates 1024 consecutive bit features at a time. Each bit corresponds to a group or element, with the presence of the corresponding group denoted by the numerical value 1 and the absence of the group denoted by 0. Subse- quently, after converting all the drug molecules into bit features, we filtered out additional bits with a value of 1. This not only preserved the impact of features on the results but also reduced the dimensionality of the data optimization operation process. For the dataset of cytotoxicity, the size, identified cell type, zeta potential, cell exposure time, and concentration of MOFs as well as the average values of cell viability were added to each item. Detailed information for the datasets is available in the supporting information (Table S1 for drug loading capacity and Table S2 for cytotoxicity). 2.2. ML models based on stacking algorithms In this model, the physical structure or properties of each MOF were transformed into numerical feature vectors (i.e., metal atoms, organic ligands, functional groups, and properties). For the feature vectors, the one-hot encoding feature indicates the presence or absence of the spe- cific organic ligands, metal atoms, or functional groups in the MOFs. Feature screening was performed using a variance filter to reduce the complexity of operations, which can also avoid redundant or missing information features (Yu and Liu, 2004). From an empirical point of view, stacking algorithms involve the use of two or more base models. The individual learner is referred to as the primary learner (base models), and the learner used for combination is called the secondary learner or meta-models (Reddy et al., 2022; Pavlyshenko, 2018). To predict the drug loading capacity or the cytotoxicity of MOFs, multiple models were chosen to be stacked. These models include AdaBoost, CatBoost, BayesianRidge, RF, DT, HGB, LGBM, KNR, and support vector regression. The selection of these models was based on their wide applicability and excellent prediction performance. To determine the best combination of models, a manual integration approach with two or three models was employed, similar to the prac- tices of other researchers in model selection (Guo et al., 2020; LI et al., 2023). RF has excellent learning ability while effectively avoiding overfitting. KNR possesses the characteristics of high prediction accu- racy and insensitivity to outliers (Shakhovska et al., 2022). LGBM, AdaBoost, and CatBoost, known for their remarkable results in their respective fields, were chosen as base models owing to their excellent prediction performance (Qu et al., 2021). In addition, by performing hyperparameter tuning, it was ensured that the stacking models using AdaBoost, CatBoost, RF, and DT achieved good performance in drug loading capacity. For cytotoxicity prediction, stacking models using KNR, LGBM, HGB, RF, and DT were employed. Furthermore, by con- ducting hyperparameter tuning on the models, the prediction accuracy and robustness were effectively improved. The selected models and appropriate parameter settings, coupled with the small amount of data used, have resulted in negligible running times. In terms of data fitting, the model-specific fivefold cross-validation was used within the black box (Guo et al., 2020; Wang and Wang, 2022), which is a widely applicable evaluation method that can be employed across various domains and problem types (Dhandapani et al., 2023). This method was used in the primary stage of the stacking al- gorithm to convert the original features into secondary features. The features in the secondary data generally no longer include the original features (Pavlyshenko, 2018; Sikora and Al-laymoun, 2014). These converted secondary features were then systematically trained and fitted by the meta-learner. By dividing the dataset into five subsets of equal size, one subset was selected as the validation set, whereas the remaining four subsets served as the training set. This process was repeated five times with different combinations of training and valida- tion sets to reduce bias introduced by specific data segmentation. Consequently, the risk of overfitting is reduced, leading to enhanced representativeness of the evaluation outcomes. By employing fivefold cross-validation, we were able to compare performance differences be- tween different models. In addition, this approach enhances the Y. Wang et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 3 transferability of the model, ultimately improving the overall perfor- mance of the model. To further improve the performance of the entire model, a simple MLP was used as the meta-model. In the level 1 layer of the meta-model, it learns how to best combine the prediction results of the base models for making predictions. In summary, the workflow of the stacking model is as follows: (1) The training dataset is divided into K non-overlapping folds. (2) An empty list of meta-models and an N × M two-dimensional array (where N represents the number of training samples and M denotes the number of meta-models) is created to store meta-features. (3) The current fold is designated as the validation set, whereas the remaining folds serve as the training set. (4) The meta- model is fitted using the training set data. (5) Predictions are made on the validation set data, and the results are saved in the corresponding locations of the meta-features matrix. (6) The final prediction model is trained using the stacked features matrix and the original label data. (7) Predictions are made on the test set data using the trained final pre- diction model. 2.3. The interpretability of ML models In the field of artificial intelligence, ML algorithms are usually considered as a black box model because they cannot provide any direct explanation for their predictions (Casalicchio et al., 2019). It is also difficult to visualize their operation in this approach. Therefore, many researchers have developed and implemented several model-agnostic interpretability tools to quantify or visualize feature effects or feature importance, which assess the extent to which features contribute to predictions (Apley and Zhu, 2020). In this study, the causality of the ML black box was interpreted through PDPs and ICE. PDPs visually illustrate the relationship between low-cardinality subsets of the feature set and the average effect of the other predictors in the model, whereas ICE plots are used to disaggregate this average by displaying the estimated functional relationship for each data point. Moreover, PDPs can also be used to rank and score the predictors in terms of their relative influence on the predicted outcomes (Greenwell et al., 2018). This reveals the relationship between the target and a feature, whether it is linear, monotonic, positively correlated, or negatively correlated (Zhao and Hastie, 2019). The output of the ML model can be interpreted by calculating the contribution of each feature to the predicted outcome using SHAP (Nohara et al., 2022). It provides a unified approach to feature impor- tance that includes not only the individual effect of each feature but also the interaction effects between them (Lundberg and Lee, 2017a). In addition, it can be visualized using a summary plot, which shows the importance of each feature among all predictions. Furthermore, the SHAP dependence plot can be used to visualize the impact of a single feature on the predicted result while considering the effects of other features. By using this method, we can effectively explain the contri- bution of each feature to its corresponding prediction (Lundberg and Lee, 2017b; Nohara et al., 2022). Feature importance was used in this study as well. It is an algorithm for calculating the importance of model features (Goldstein et al., 2015). The basic method involves assuming the importance of the feature to be studied and then shuffling this column of data while leaving the data in other columns unchanged. Subsequently. the predicted metric (e.g., absolute error and R 2) or the change in loss is assessed. The importance of the feature is then determined based on the amount of change observed (Lipton, 2018; Stiglic et al., 2020). If shuffling the data has no effect on the accuracy rate, it can be inferred that the feature has little impact on the properties of MOFs or that its importance is relatively low. 2.4. Experimental validation 2.4.1. Materials and cells Benzoic acid, 2-Aminoterephthalic acid, p-Toluic acid (AR), Tetra- butyl titanate, 3-(4,5-Dimethyliazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltrazolium bromide (MTT), Zirconium (IV) chloride (ZrCl4), N,N- Dimethylformamide (DMF), Methanol (AR), Doxorubicin hydrochlo- ride (DOX), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Macklin Corp and were used without further purification. The Raw 264.7 cell lines were purchased from Shanghai Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China. RAW264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10 % FBS, 100 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate and 100 U/mL penicillin G sodium in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37℃. 2.4.2. Synthesis of UIO-66-NH2 and MIL-125-NH2 Two types of MOFs (UIO-66-NH2 and MIL-125-NH2) were synthe- sized according to a revised procedure reported elsewhere (Cavka et al., 2008; Vilela et al., 2017). First, an appropriate amount of 2-aminoter- ephthalic acid and either ZrCl4 or tetrabutyl titanate were added into a beaker containing DMF under stirring for 30 min. Subsequently, p- toluic acid or benzoic acid was added to the mixture, and the resulting solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The reaction was carried out in an explosion-protected oven at 100 ◦C or 150 ◦C for 24 h. After the reaction was completed, DMF and methanol were used as solvents to remove any residual reactants, and the resulting light-pink powder or light-yellow powder was obtained after being air- dried in an 80 ◦C oven for 1 day. 2.4.3. Cytotoxicity assay of UIO-66-NH2 and MIL-125-NH2 The effects of UIO-66-NH2 and MIL-125-NH2 on cell viability of Raw 264.7 were determined by MTT assay. Raw 264.7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 5,000 cells per well and treated with different concentrations (15, 30, 60, 125, and 250 µg/mL) of MOFs. After 24 h of cell seeding, the culture media was replaced with fresh media containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT and incubated for 3 h under culture conditions. The MTT solution was then removed, and formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 200 µL of DMSO to each well. The absorbance (O.D.) of the solution was measured using a microplate reader at 490 nm. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. 2.4.4. DOX loading DOX is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug of anthracycline. It treats cancer by inhibiting the synthesis of cellular DNA and is one of the chemotherapy drugs used in the clinical treatment of bone tumors. DOX (10 mg) was dissolved in deionized water (10 ml), and UIO-66-NH2 or MIL-125-NH2 (5 mg) was added for ultrasonic dispersion in the DOX aqueous solution. The solution was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 24 h. After 24 h, the obtained solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant and precipitation were collected. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 480 nm using a UV–VIS spectrophotom- eter to calculate the drug loading capacity. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Comparison of different ML models The processed dataset was divided into a training set and a testing set according to an 8:2 ratio. We fine-tuned the hyperparameters of eight ML models (AdaBoost, CatBoost, RF, DT, KNR, LGBM, HGB, and Stacking) and compared their performance (Tables S3 and S4). Following the optimization of parameters, the optimal performance model was obtained, as presented in Table 1 (for the drug loading ca- pacity) and Table 2 (for the cytotoxicity). The results indicate that the stacking algorithms outperform the individual basic models in terms of R 2, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). These findings suggest that the stacking algorithms provide more ac- curate predictions for both the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs. Y. Wang et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 4 3.2. The analysis of important features The drug loading capacity and biocompatibility of MOFs are both of great importance when MOFs are employed as drug carriers in biomedical applications. Therefore, insight into the important features accounting for drug loading capacity or cytotoxicity of MOFs can be acquired using feature importance analysis. To evaluate feature impor- tance, features were assessed by calculating their importance using different models and then ranked in descending order accordingly (Table 3). For the drug loading capacity of MOFs, the importance of features was calculated using the DT, SHAP, RF, and CatBoost models (Figure S1). The statistical analysis of feature importance revealed that the central metal atoms (Cr and Mg), organic ligands (e.g., 2,5-dioxido- terephthalate (Dio), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (Bdc), and isophthalic acid (Isa)), and the substructure of the drug molecules (bit148, bit223, and bit657) (the corresponding molecular substructure can be found in Table 4) are the important features that affect the drug loading capacity of MOFs. It is noteworthy that all three mentioned molecular sub- structures contain hydrogen, and both the hydroxyl group (bit223) and the amino group (bit 148) may form hydrogen bonds. Similarly, hydrogen bonds may develop between the drug molecules and organic ligands and/or functional groups present in MOFs. The number and location of hydrogen bonds can regulate properties such as drug solu- bility, stability, and pharmacokinetics. This could explain their influ- ence on drug loading capacity (Li and Yang, 2015). For the cytotoxicity analysis, the DT, SHAP, RF, and LGBM models were used to calculate the feature importance (Figure S2). Physical properties such as concentration, size, and zeta potential could be recognized as shared important features accounting for the cytotoxicity of MOFs (Table 3). The results indicate that central atoms Zn and Cu and the organic ligand 2-methylimidazole (Meim) are the important struc- tural features influencing the cytotoxicity of MOFs. Previous studies have reported that Cr(III)-based MIL-100 did not induce toxic effects on cell lines, whereas Fe(III)-based MIL-100 caused significant cell death, loss of cell impedance, high accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and DNA damage (Grall et al., 2015). In another study, it was revealed that cytotoxicity of MOF-74 with different central metal atoms followed this trend: Mn(II)-based MOF-74 > Cu(II)-based MOF-74 > Zn (II)-based MOF-74 > Mg(II)-based MOF-74 (Hao et al., 2022). These findings suggest that biocompatible metals such as Mg and Ni result in lower cytotoxicity, whereas transition metals such as Cu and Mn, which generate high ROS, exhibit stronger cytotoxicity (Ruyra et al., 2015; Sifaoui et al., 2021). Importantly, these results reveal that central metal atoms, such as Zn, Cr, Fe, Cu, and Zr, play crucial roles in both drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs. To delve into the detailed relationships of important features ac- counting for drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity, the contribution values of these features were obtained in ML using the calculation method of Shapley values in game theory (ˇStrumbelj and Kononenko, 2014). The features of central atoms, organic ligands, and other relevant factors were first sorted by their global impact, and then the dots rep- resenting the SHAP values were plotted horizontally (Fujimoto et al., 2006; Lundberg et al., 2018). Each dot was colored according to the value of that feature, ranging from low (blue) to high (red). If the impact of the feature on the model’s output varies smoothly as its value changes, then this coloring will also have a smooth gradation (Strumbelj and Kononenko, 2010). For the drug loading capacity prediction of MOFs (Fig. 1A), the features were sorted by SHAP values so that a feature with a greater effect on model performance was shown at a higher position. For instance, Cr and Mg atoms and the organic ligand Dio at the top of the figure have the greatest effect on performance. The general trend of red dots reaching to the right, but not to the left, sig- nifies that the impact of each feature is monotonous in nature. There- fore, an increase in each SHAP value leads to an increase in effect. Similarly, Fe and Zn atoms and concentration (Con) are the most important features for cytotoxicity (Fig. 1B). Significantly, the concen- tration exhibits a negative correlation with cytotoxicity, as its highest value is observed on the left side of the plot. 3.3. The top four important features analyzed by PDPs and ICE To analyze the relationship between features, the top four important features for the drug loading capacity of MOFs were obtained by PDPs and ICE analysis (Fig. 2). Each feature is represented along the hori- zontal axis of the plot (with the presence of the corresponding group denoted by the numerical value 1 and the absence of the group denoted by 0). The vertical axis is the degree of influence of the feature on the model. The red line represents the average predicted feature effect, and the blue line represents the individual effect of each predicted feature. When the curve trend is steep or fluctuating, it indicates that this feature has a large contribution. The partial dependence of feature and drug loading capacity is linear. The ICE plots are used to disaggregate the average effect of Dio by displaying the estimated function relationship for each data point, as shown in Fig. 2A. It can be observed that the shape of the individual Dio features changes noticeably, indicating the presence of interactions. The organic ligand Dio demonstrates a positive effect on the drug loading capacity of MOFs. Previous research revealed that the introduction of Dio could impart MOFs with an intrinsic basic lattice activity. The basic phenolate oxygen atoms within such ligands Table 1 Performance of different ML models for predicting the drug loading capacity of MOFs.

International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 5 may have an impact on MOFs’ performance, as they constitute the active site together with the adjacent coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms (Valvekens et al., 2014). Regarding metal atoms, magnesium is known for its excellent biological compatibility and low toxicity. Moreover, it is one of the lowest-density metals; thus, it exhibits increased gravimetric uptake capacity for drug molecules (Wu et al., 2019). The PDPs and ICE of other features in the supporting information indicate that the effect might be considerably smaller, as the partial dependence changes are relatively flat. For more information about the features, refer to the supporting information (Figure S3). For the cytotoxicity analysis of MOFs, the top four important features were also obtained by PDPs and ICE analysis (Fig. 3). The results demonstrate that the relationship between the partial dependence and the feature accounting for cytotoxicity is nonlinear. The ICE plots are used to disaggregate the average concentration by displaying the esti- mated functional relationship for each data point (Fig. 3A). It can be observed that the concentration has a negative effect on cytotoxicity. The shape of the individual concentration feature changes noticeably, indicating the presence of interactions. At concentrations of 200 and 250 μg/ml, both the average and individual values decrease sharply, representing the segmentation point of performance. It is not surprising that a higher concentration of MOFs results in higher cytotoxicity. For instance, ZIF-8 has shown high cytotoxicity toward different cancer cells at higher concentrations, which may be attributed to the significant Fig. 1.

International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 6 increase in ROS and changes in the cell cycle (Hao et al., 2022). Regarding the size of MOFs, the shape of the individual size feature changes noticeably. The segmentation points are approximately 135 and 207 nm (Fig. 3D). The non-toxicity of MOFs could be associated with the low toxicity of their metal components and their relatively larger size. The invasive nature of MOFs through different cell barriers directly depends on their size. It is speculated that MOFs that are less than 100 nm in size can pass through cell membranes (Sajid, 2016). MOFs smaller than 40 nm can enter the cell nucleus, whereas those smaller than 35 nm can penetrate the blood–brain barrier (Kumar et al., 2019). Moreover, decreasing particle size leads to a significant increase in surface area, exposing a greater proportion of atoms to the biological environment and inducing cytotoxicity. Smaller MOFs exhibit higher chemical reac- tivity, resulting in faster degradation rates within cells. Over time, the strength of coordinative bonds between metal atoms and organic linkers becomes rather weak and can be easily destroyed by competition with the interaction between metal clusters and solvents (Luo et al., 2014; Sifaoui et al., 2021). The partial dependence changes for other features are relatively flat (Figure S4), indicating a smaller effect of these features on the cytotoxicity of MOFs. To go a step further, we analyzed the interaction between two of the top four features accounting for the cytotoxicity of MOFs by PDPs. As shown in Fig. 4A–C, the partial dependence of zeta potential, size, and time are negatively correlated with concentration, indicating that the effects of zeta potential, size, and time on the cytotoxicity of MOFs are more noticeable when the concentration of MOFs is relatively low (less than 50 μg/ml). For the interaction between size and zeta potential, the most significant influence on the cytotoxicity of MOFs occurs at the size range of 25 to135 nm and the zeta potential range of 25 to 33 mV, as evidenced by the highest partial dependence values (the yellow region) shown in Fig. 4D. 3.4. The interaction of different features accounting for the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs We further analyzed the interaction of different features accounting for the drug loading capacity of MOFs in detail. As shown in Fig. 5, the size of the circle represents the item number, and the color grade rep- resents the importance of the feature. For the Cr atom (Fig. 5A), the darkest circle was observed when the Cr atom was absent (the value was 0) and interacted with the organic ligand Dio. It indicates that the drug loading capacity was influenced by Dio. For the Mg atom (Fig. 5B), the darkest circle was observed when the Mg atom was present (the value was 1) and interacted with Dio. This implies that the factors affecting the drug loading capacity were determined by both Dio and the Mg atom. As an example, MOF-74 exhibited a high methotrexate (MTX) loading ca- pacity of 2.88 g/g (Table S1). For the analysis of the cytotoxicity of MOFs, we analyzed the inter- action of the concentration in combination with central atoms (Fig. 6A) or organic ligands (Fig. 6B). It indicates that MOFs composed of the Zn, Cr, and Fe atoms have a significant effect on cell viability at relatively low concentrations (between 0 and 12 μg/ml), as evidenced by the darker color of the circle (Fig. 6A). As an example, Fe-MIL-88B-NH2 exhibited a cell viability as high as 96.83 % (Table S5). Furthermore, MOFs containing organic ligands such as Meim, benzene-1,3,5- tricarboxylic acid (Btc), imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2Ica), and Bdc have a significant effect on cell viability (Table S5) at low concentrations (between 0 and 12 μg/ml) (Fig. 6B). It is apparent that the circle size of the organic ligand Bdc remains generally large, indicating that there are more MOFs with this organic ligand. Details regarding the interaction of other features accounting for the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs can be found in the supporting information (Figures S5–S7). 3.5. The validation of ML models To validate the reliability of stacking algorithms, we conducted the feature importance analysis using multiple models, as well as the PDP and SHAP analysis methods. We identified common important features that had significant effects on both drug loading capacity and cytotox- icity, specifically the specific metal atoms (Zn, Cr, Fe, Cu, and Zr). In addition, organic ligands such as Dio, Bdc, and Isa, as well as the mo- lecular structure of the drug (bit148, bit223, and bit657), were found to be crucial in determining the drug loading capacity of MOFs. These findings align with previous studies (Hao et al., 2022; Sifaoui et al., 2021), confirming that our model effectively identifies and uses relevant features. This provides validation and establishes the model’s reliability. For the performance analysis of the model, cross-validation was employed during the training process. The selection of the number of folds involves a trade-off. When using fewer than five folds, it was observed that cross-validation results in a training set score close to 1, whereas the test set score was significantly lower. It became evident that the model was overfitting the training data because the small training sets in each fold could lead to poor performance on the test data. Conversely, when more than five folds were employed, it was noticed that the scores of the training and test sets of the model gradually decreased with the increase in the number of folds and even only sta- bilized in the range of 0.3–0.4. Nevertheless, in fivefold cross-validation, the scores of the training and test sets were closely aligned, with a dif- ference of only approximately 0.2. This indicated that the model effec- tively mitigated the problem of overfitting and underfitting, thereby improving its transferability. In addition, we also analyzed the dataset’s item distribution. In the cytotoxicity dataset, MOFs named ZIF-8 constituted 23 % of the total, whereas other MOFs were relatively evenly distributed, accounting for approximately 10 %. After pre- processing the dataset, we removed items for ZIF-90 and UiO-66, which had relatively uniform amounts, leaving the remaining data for model testing. The result revealed that although the ranking of important features shifted, it remained in line with our current conclusions. In addition, we experimented with removing ZIF-8, which had the largest number of items in the dataset, and tested the model on the remaining data. We found that the model’s results remained generally consistent with the existing findings, with important features still being Con, Size, and zeta potential. Therefore, it can be concluded that a uniform dis- tribution of data items yields more reliable prediction results than a concentrated distribution. When data availability is limited, techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning can help rebalance the Fig. 3. PDPs and ICE analysis of the top four important features accounting for the cytotoxicity of MOFs. A: Concentration, B: Zeta potential, C: Time, and D: Size. Y. Wang et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 7 dataset, thereby enhancing the model’s transferability. To further compare the prediction performance of multiple models, we used a regression model for multi-index evaluation. The important evaluation metrics included R 2, MAE, and RMSE. Compared with the individual model, the superposition model showed better performance. Specifically, the stacking model achieved R 2 value close to 0.9, with both MAE and RMSE values remaining within a few percentage points. To further validate the model, after data elimination and processing in the dataset, we found that the R 2 value of the stacking model was approximately 0.3 higher than that of the single independent model. This indicates that the stacking model exhibits stronger generalization ability and is better suited for delivering robust prediction performance across various datasets than the single independent model. Stability analysis was performed using the test set to compare the actual average values with the predicted values for drug loading ca- pacity (Fig. 7) and cytotoxicity (Fig. 8). For the drug loading capacity, the metal atom Cr was selected as an important feature. It is obvious that the majority of the MOFs in the dataset do not contain a Cr atom (Cr_0). Nevertheless, the presence of the Cr atom (Cr_1) in MOFs has a signifi- cant impact on the drug loading capacity. For the cytotoxicity, it is not surprising that as the concentration increases, the cell viability de- creases. The predicted values for both drug loading capacity and cyto- toxicity are close to the average values and exhibit consistent trends. This confirms the accuracy and reliability of the prediction models used in this study. Additional comparisons between the actual average values and the predicted values for other important features can be found in the supporting information (Figure S8-S9). 3.6. Proof of concept experimental validation The proof-of-concept experiment was also conducted to validate the predicted results. UIO-66-NH2 and MIL-125-NH2 NPs were successfully synthesized (TEM images are shown in Figures S10 and S11). We sub- sequently investigated their drug loading capacity for DOX as well as their cytotoxicity. Experimental measurements yielded DOX loading capacities of 0.144 g/g for UIO-66-NH2 and 0.322 g/g for MIL-125-NH2. Fig. 4. PDPs analysis of the interaction between two of the top four features accounting for the cytotoxicity of MOFs. A: Concentration and Zeta potential, B: Concentration and Size, C: Concentration and Time, D: Size and Zeta potential. Y. Wang et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 8 As a comparison, we used the model to predict the drug loading ca- pacities of both MOFs, resulting in predicted values of 0.197 and 0.240 g/g, respectively (Fig. 9A). The MAE and RMSE of the model were found to be 0.067 and 0.069, respectively, demonstrating its excellent pre- dictive performance for the drug loading capacity of MOFs. Similarly, the model was employed to predict the cytotoxicity of UIO-66-NH2 at various concentrations, compared with experimental results. As illus- trated in Fig. 9B, the model also exhibited excellent predictive perfor- mance with an MAE of 0.014 and an RMSE of 0.019, further demonstrating the feasibility of the developed stacking algorithms. 3.7. Discussion For the comparative analysis of multiple models, we conducted a study on the prediction performance of both single models and stacked models. We randomly selected 90 %, 80 %, and 70 % of the data from the original dataset for the predictions using different models. The results showed that the prediction performance R 2 of the single model was significantly lower than that of the stacked model, and the prediction performance of the single model also decreased significantly as the amount of data decreased. However, for the stacked model, the pre- dicted R 2 values for each subset consistently ranged between 0.80 and 0.82. Notably, the stacked model maintained a good predictive perfor- mance across different dataset sizes, with R2 values remaining above 0.8, even when the dataset size was reduced. These results demonstrate that the stacked model not only delivers higher prediction accuracy but also exhibits remarkable stability compared with individual ML models. In addition, the performance of the base model can affect the ulti- mate effectiveness of the stacked model. When constructing stacked models, it is essential to thoroughly consider the learning ability of the Fig. 5. PDPs analysis of the interaction between the central atoms (A: Cr atom and B: Mg atom) and organic ligands on the drug loading capacity of MOFs. Fig. 6. PDPs analysis of the interaction between the concentration and central atoms (A) or organic ligands (B) on the cytotoxicity of MOFs. Y. Wang et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 9 base model to achieve effective complementarity among the models. By traversing all available models, the model with strong learning capa- bility and significant architectural differences was employed as the base learner, thereby enhancing the overall predictive performance of the model (Guo et al., 2020; LI et al., 2023). For instance, when the Baye- sianRidge and RF combination served as the base model, its predicted R 2 was 0.54, which is lower than the prediction accuracy of the individual RF model. This suggests that the BayesianRidge model is unsuitable as the base model for the stacked model because it exhibits significant errors in individual predictions, consequently diminishing the overall model accuracy within the stacked model. In our study, when the base model was constructed using models with high prediction accuracy and substantial variations in model architecture, such as the combination of RF, CatBoost, and LGBM, the stacked model exhibited improvements in terms of R 2, MAE, and RMSE. Its predicted R 2 exceeded that of the in- dividual RF model, reaching approximately 0.9. It can be inferred that the practice of employing model combinations with strong generaliza- tion to rectify the biases of various learning algorithms on the training set results in a more effective fusion effect within the stacked model. Overall, the stacked model constructed in this study is a prediction model composed of single models with outstanding performance, thereby overcoming the limitations of individual models. This not only enhances the efficiency and convenience of practical applications but also ensures the applicability of these models in scientific research, especially within the field of nanomaterials research and related disciplines. 4. Conclusions and perspectives In this study, the stacking algorithms were employed to predict the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs. The results showed that the stacking algorithms outperform other ML algorithms with better R 2, MAE, and RMSE. Several model interpretations and analysis methods were also employed for important feature analysis. It was revealed that central atoms Zn, Cr, Fe, Cu, and Zr had a significant effect on the drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity of MOFs. Furthermore, the interaction of central atoms Cr and Mg with the organic ligand Dio enhanced the encapsulation of specific drugs such as gemcitabine, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil. The PDPs and SHAP analysis showed that central atoms Cr and Cu and the organic ligand, 1,4-bis (triazol-1-yl) terephthalic acid negatively affected drug loading capacity and cytotoxicity, whereas Fig. 7. The actual average values vs the predicted values for the drug loading capacity of MOFs in the presence or absence of Cr atoms. Fig. 8. The actual average values vs the predicted values for the cytotoxicity of MOFs at different concentrations. Y. Wang et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 656 (2024) 124128 10 central atoms Zn, Fe, and Zr had a positive impact. To further analyze the properties of MOFs, future research can explore techniques such as feature engineering, domain adaptation, and multitask learning. In addition, experiments will be conducted to vali- date the new insights obtained from this study. This validation will help ensure the reliability and applicability of the obtained results. Further- more, with the increase in dataset items, efforts will be made to further enhance the performance of the algorithms used in the analysis. Incor- porating additional molecular structure features such as bonds, angles, and other relevant MOF stability parameters, as well as considering factors such as suitable temperature conditions, the effect of repetitive doses, and accumulation exertion patterns, into the dataset can enhance the analysis of MOFs. Simultaneously, Shapley additive global impor- tance (SAGE) global variable analysis and accumulated local effects, which strip away the influence of the independence of related variables, can be added to analyze the dataset. This enables a more detailed analysis of the effect of the interaction between multiple features on the results during graphic interpretation and data analysis. Consequently, the application of stacked models extends beyond the field of MOFs, and they can also be applied to other biomaterials. In conclusion, these re- sults provide valuable insights for the selection of MOFs in drug delivery applications. They not only bridge the gap in ML predictions of drug loading and cell toxicity but also highlight the significance of feature importance analysis in predicting outcomes. Most importantly, the screening of ML models can offer direct guidance, allowing for the synthesis of MOFs with high drug loading capacity and low cell toxicity, thereby minimizing the production of unnecessary MOFs. This has sig- nificant implications in various aspects. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yang Wang: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Visualization, Software, Methodology.
